It is a brilliant record; I think it&#39;s one of the crowning jewels of the genre both musically and in lyrical poetry.

It&#39;s a concept album, tracing the journey of the energy of a photon of light. Each song is its own self-contained story, starting with the entrance of this bit of energy into a life and ending with the extinguishing of that life&#39;s light and the energy&#39;s departure. It starts in the fusion forges of the sun, in [An Ember&#39;s Arc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyuDOVm8TG4):

&amp;gt; This cascade of embers,

&amp;gt; Fused into a star&#39;s ignition

&amp;gt; A crucible for their collapse,

&amp;gt; Seething crux of its ambition

&amp;gt; ---

&amp;gt; The axiom of this expanse,

&amp;gt; Unrelenting pressure

&amp;gt; Every moment, in each place,

&amp;gt; Collisions beyond measure

&amp;gt; ---

&amp;gt; An ordinary pair that met,

&amp;gt; Whilst merging into one,

&amp;gt; Heaved and spat a mote of light,

&amp;gt; Adrift within the Sun

and it ends in the funeral pyre of a man in [The Smoke of Many Fires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARI0XyTiips):

&amp;gt; Like billions before him regardless of form

&amp;gt; It ended as chance had decided

&amp;gt; So briefly contained an inferno&#39;s refrain

&amp;gt; Having powered and angered and guided

&amp;gt; ---

&amp;gt; At the heart of the blaze awareness dissolved

&amp;gt; Light ascended devoid of desire

&amp;gt; From a trail intertwined life and death strewn behind

&amp;gt; To the stars it returned from the fire</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w524ad/friday_fun_thread_for_july_22_2022/ih8alu4/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w524ad/friday_fun_thread_for_july_22_2022/ih7phca/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">What’s the simplest, most barebones game you can think of?

This was partly designed as a bonding experience with my dad and partly because it feels to me like the liberation of France is arguably Western democracy’s finest hour.

In short, I’d recommend the trip. A number of the sites are extremely high quality and clearly received considerable investment from the US government. I almost skipped it, but I’m glad I stopped at the [cemetery at Omaha beach ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_American_Cemetery_and_Memorial). The grounds are beautiful, and I found the experience of seeing the graves of so many young men surprisingly moving.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w524ad/friday_fun_thread_for_july_22_2022/ih5t22k/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
