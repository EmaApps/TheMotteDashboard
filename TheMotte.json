But not through naturalization or birth; I used an uncommon route with a new and somewhat strange process: a StAG section (\u00a7) 5 declaration. While going through this, I had learned a lot about that citizenship laws of Germany and some comparisons with other countries, as well as spending (too much) time browsing various expat and citizenship forums and subreddits. I\u2019d like to ~~subject you to~~ share with you what I\u2019ve learned in this weird journey, through intergenerational citizenship and questions of national identity.\n\n###Background\n\nWith so many immigrants out there, why should you listen to me, an American moving between western countries? Well, I, personally, value it more when people put in effort for something with less assured payoff; few want to split lottery tickets, everyone wants to split the winnings. Similarly, I moved to Germany as someone with only German heritage, as a normal immigrant, and then more than a year after that a new law offered me a privileged path to citizenship through legal magic. In short, I committed to Germany and then received the winning lottery ticket.\n\nA bit more about my path: I moved to Germany in 2020 with the [EU Blue Card] (https://www.bamf.de/EN/Themen/MigrationAufenthalt/ZuwandererDrittstaaten/Migrathek/BlaueKarteEU/blauekarteeu-node.html) for highly qualified immigrants. I chose Germany because part of my family was from Germany, and in the typical American style I considered myself German-American. I had visited Germany and liked it, although I knew visiting and living somewhere are two very different things. But what I would really like to stress is that visiting Germany felt like visiting a home, a place that felt natural. I\u2019ve visited plenty of other countries, and everywhere else it was clear that they were foreign, \u201calien\u201d countries. It was obvious when I was in Japan that no matter how much I might like visiting castles or eating ramen, Japan would remain a foreign country. When it was unclear whether I would be still working in Germany, a friend suggested that I work with them in the Netherlands, and a big hangup was that the Netherlands was a foreign country, this despite the fact that they speak more English and I would be around more English-speaking expats. Germany was the ancestral homeland, and no other country could ever replace that.\n\nGerman citizenship is based primarily on *jus sanguinis*, citizenship by blood: someone is a German citizen at birth because their parents were citizens. But this was, in the past, primarily patrilineal. In fact, the German citizenship in my family was cut off when my German grandmother married a foreigner: she automatically lost her German citizenship, rendering her stateless and all her children non-Germans, including my father, and all of her grandchildren were not German either, including me.\n\nIn August 2021 Germany passed an amendment to the Staatsangeh\u00f6rigkeitsgesetz (StAG), or nationality law. The new StAG \u00a7 5 allows those who, to quote the federal authority, \u201cwere previously excluded by gender-discriminatory regulations from acquiring German citizenship at birth may now acquire it by [way of declaration.] (https://www.bva.bund.de/EN/Services/Citizens/ID-Documents-Law/Citizenship/4_StAG/german_citizenship_law.html) Briefly, the post-war German Basic Law (a constitution) forbids gender discrimination, and so those who were excluded from acquiring citizenship due to this gender discrimination could [claim it back] (https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stag/englisch_stag.html); for example, until 1975, German women would not pass down citizenship by default. The process is new enough that the relevant authority here in Germany, in a major city, did not know about it. But I collected all of our old documents, submitted my application, and now (as of the time of writing) the certificate is in the mail in hand!\n\nI did it, I became a German citizen! I did not naturalize, I gained citizenship through declaration (queue up, \u201cI didn\u2019t say citizenship, I declared it!\u201d). I did not have to reside in Germany for 6-8 years, I did not have to speak German, pass any test, pay any money or do anything at all but submit a few documents and citizenship was handed down in a puff of magical legal smoke by a bureaucrat I\u2019ve never met before. If I suffered some brain damage I could commit terrorism or racially motivated crimes, things that would have excluded me before, and still keep the citizenship (I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll test that though). And my children will also be German citizens from birth, and their children, and so on forever, just as it had been passed down to me from forever ago (well, at least since 1871).\n\nBut importantly, I haven\u2019t been saying that I became German. I don\u2019t speak German, I didn\u2019t grow up in Germany, and neither did my parents. By the Basic Law, I am a German because I hold German citizenship, but I try to look past the purely legal standing. I don\u2019t think the idea of who is German has a really clear and universal answer; different people and different Germans give different answers. Perhaps we can talk about the traits of Germans, but until we have access to the pure and perfect German Form, arguments are really all we can get. I will reference that concept of being a German plenty though, and the legal vs. cultural German.\n\nThat gives my background and stake in the matter, and it will make for a nice dinner party story but isn\u2019t that important. In fact, nothing really changes legally for me anyway, my permit covered it all before. I think it\u2019s much more interesting to talk about what I\u2019ve learned along the way, as it might actually be interesting and useful for everyone else. So here it goes!\n\n###The Strangeness of Descent Laws\n\nGerman citizenship by descent is a mess, but it\u2019s interesting to take a little dip into the law. Before I only said that German citizenship is based on descent, which glosses over many of the complications that arise in tracing that path. A nice guide on the process can be found [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/citizenship). The US (and most countries in the Americas) use primarily jus soli or birthright citizenship, i.e. you are a citizen of a country if you are born in that country, but also has [citizenship by descent] (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Acquisition-US-Citizenship-Child-Born-Abroad.html). But it\u2019s much more restrictive; in particular, while German citizenship by descent is basically limitless, US citizenship by descent requires that if e.g. the child has two citizen parents, at least one resided in the US at any point, or if only one parent is a US citizen they must have resided in the US for at least five years. I call this a \u201csunset clause\u201d in citizenship, something that terminates citizenship automatically without a connection to the home country.\n\nWithout a solid sunset clause in the German citizenship by descent, you get some (in my personal view) strange lines of descent. Someone whose great-great-great-grandfather left Germany in the late 1800s can be a German citizen directly if it happens to pass only through the male line in key years. Compare this to someone whose German mother married a foreigner and they were born in 1948; their path to citizenship would be under StAG \u00a714, and they have to establish a close connection to Germany, such as speaking German and having close family members in Germany. Here we see that you can only be a legal German if you establish that you are already a cultural German. Add on to this complications such as if your parents naturalized before or after you were born, if you served in a foreign military, if you every voluntarily gained citizenship of another country, and it gets complicated. To note, Germany has added a sunset clause: if a German citizen is born abroad after 1999, any of their children born abroad only retain German citizenship if the authorities are notified before the [child\u2019s first birthday] (https://www.germany.info/us-en/service/03-Citizenship/german-citizenship-acquired-through-notification-of-birth-occuring-abroad/943378). No more surprise citizenships by descent a hundred years down the line.\n\nAll of this has led to a lot of people sorting through old paperwork to find out if they are secretly German citizens or can become one. I like to point to the growth of r/GermanCitizenship as [part of it] (https://subredditstats.com/r/germancitizenship), but the perhaps better known example is for Italy, where it is popular enough to have consular wait times in years and a [CNN article about it] (https://web.archive.org/web/20220621175345/https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-citizenship-007-documents-francesco-curione/index.html). I\u2019ll just voice my personal opinion that all of this is a little strange to me; when one out of sixteen or thirty-two of your ancestors at a particular level came from a particular country, it\u2019s hard for me to see where exactly your connection comes in. The legal case may be perfectly fine, but the cultural part falls through. I normally see it chalked up to \u201chonoring ancestors\u201d or \u201ckeeping their memory alive,\u201d which turns into an excuse to have a nice passport and travel the EU visa-free as far as I\u2019ve seen.\n\nAnd I should mention that Germany, in principle, discourages dual citizenship. If you naturalize, you normally must give up other citizenships, if it is possible and doesn\u2019t cause undue hardship. Notably, the fees to renounce US citizenship are high enough that the authorities may permit you to keep US citizenship if you make less per month than the fees, $2,350. It also permits dual citizenship if other citizenships were gained automatically, i.e. from birthright. There are many exceptions nowadays, but the principle still exists, and causes problems sometimes when e.g. people are forced to [choose a nationality] (https://web.archive.org/web/20210220071357/https:/www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/world/europe/16iht-letter16.html).\n\nFinally, I will point out that StAG \u00a75 vs. \u00a714 (post- vs. pre- Basic Law) seems weird to me. A German woman could lose her citizenship by marrying a foreigner in e.g. 1947, have a child in 1948 then one in 1950; the first would have to prove their ties to Germany, while the second would get in without any restrictions, but in both cases the relevant legal situation that caused the loss of citizenship is the same and only stopped in 1950(ish). For the second child, the claim would be that because the Basic Law forbids gender discrimination, they were unfairly discriminated because they should have been able to obtain citizenship from a female parent. I\u2019m not a jurist but the legal idea seems fraught: how could laws prohibiting an action in the future justify retroactive corrections? But \u00a75 covers much more than that, affecting people born as late as 1993.\n\nBut the biggest takeaway from all of this is that I have the impression that citizenship laws oftentimes are capricious and arbitrary, relying on old documents that some may or may not have and offering various paths or restrictions that change over time. Countries try to both preserve a legal basis for citizenship while trying to reasonably restrict it, while working under changing social views and massive changes in the way the world works.\n\nI think a look at the citizenship laws is helpful mostly to find out that they don\u2019t really answer anything but a legal question, which is important but not what I\u2019m after. I hope no one thinks that someone born to a German mother and a foreign father in 1974 is definitely not a citizen while a sibling born in 1976 definitely is, even if the legal situation is clear.\n\n###The Reddit Expatriation Community\n\nThat\u2019s enough about citizenship laws then. I was fascinated by (potential) immigrants, especially on Reddit, that I came across in my browsing. As an American, I grew up with the idea that America was the land of immigration and that immigration only really flowed one-way. I think the statistics bears this out, with the US having one of the lowest shares of its [population living abroad] (https://www.statista.com/chart/4237/the-countries-with-the-most-people-living-overseas/). Why would someone leave the freest and richest country?\n\nI feel like this is changing, slowly. As other countries become richer, it becomes less clear that America is the automatic best option, and it is probably easier; I can do things like videocall my parents every week and translate written text on my phone, things that make it vastly easier to emigrate. And let\u2019s be clear, the advantage of being a natural Anglophone is huge. On Reddit, which I think is primarily dominated by Americans and Anglophones in general, some of the migration-focused subreddits have seen a lot of growth: [Amerexit](https://subredditstats.com/r/amerexit), [iwantout](https://subredditstats.com/r/iwantout),and [expats] (https://subredditstats.com/r/expats). Those are my three favorite (or at least most entertaining) subreddits, and they run the gamut from \u201cAmerica sucks, I want to leave!\u201d to \u201cHow can I leave my current country (serious answers only)?\u201d to \u201cLiving in a foreign country sucks in so many ways.\u201d Pick your favorite, I guess. And like in everything else, politics is the mind-poison in immigration. But there are many common themes; I\u2019ll reference posts without linking to avoid inter-subreddit drama.\n\nI think most of these immigrants, and probably most immigrants in general, are what I would call \u201cmaterialist immigrants.\u201d Most people are looking to improve their economic situation or living standards. How they rate these things is up to them; someone may value high salaries directly, while others value more consistent healthcare coverage or walkable neighborhoods. If they\u2019re from a western country they may consider themselves (and others like them) an [expat instead of an immigrant] (https://www.google.com/search?q=expat+vs+immigrant+reddit), but it all amounts to the same thing. Even that German citizenship guide I linked before explains the benefits of becoming a German citizen in almost [purely economic terms] (https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/citizenship#wiki_benefits_of_german_citizenship): live and work in the EU! Travel visa-free in so many places with a German passport! Go to university for free! If you\u2019re destitute, Germany will take care of you! Drawbacks: none, you don\u2019t have to learn German or pay any taxes or do anything at all for anyone else.\n\nAnd the discussions reflect this living-standard/economic focus, and an entirely Ameri-centric view. Currently in r/AmerExit, someone is hating on the US because\u2026 (checks subreddit) they can find cheap mineral water while on vacation in Italy. No, I\u2019m not joking, it\u2019s the first point in a top post at the time of writing. Someone may fear American politics enough to instead move to Turkey, a country that literally went through an attempted military coup in 2016 and has a nice book review regarding [Erdogan-as-dictator on ACX] (https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-new-sultan). Or a contemporary favorite, overlooking the fact that many countries have more strict abortion laws than some US states.\n\nWhen looking for somewhere to go, I see so often that people think of moving to completely different countries, treating them all the same as if \u201cwestern European\u201d covered everything they need. One person might say Germany and\u2026 Wales? How about the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Germany, France or the UK? Another might want to move to Ireland or Scandinavia, but they speak fluent Spanish. Countries are interchangeable, as long as they have some greenery, good weather and everyone there aligns with their values. Everyone is \u201cwilling to learn the language,\u201d a completely costless declaration that I always translate to, \u201cI may learn to swim if you throw me in the middle of the ocean.\u201d Even at the end of the natural process, I can see someone declare that they are finally an \u201cEU citizen\u201d after eight years as if their citizenship was granted by Brussels and not their home country.\n\nBeyond the standard internet/Reddit stupidity, these feel like they cover an individualist- and money-focused worldview. And it naturally feeds materialist immigration that disregards the people who actually live in these places, which causes critical problems in adjusting to a life in a foreign country. Remember what I said about r/expats? It\u2019s the opposite version of r/AmerExit, where people have gone to a foreign country and found that, yeah, it\u2019s not America. This is what happens in the culture-clash. The day-to-day reality of living in a country that sees the sun for a few hours a day in the winter sets in. Of dealing with people who will always treat you like a foreigner. Of being far away from family and former friends. It\u2019s tough to live somewhere far away from home, and it\u2019s tough to know that before you actually make the move.\n\nBut\u2026 why is it tough? I haven\u2019t seen many expats complaining about their jobs, most complain about the people around them and their social life. And the world seems very thoroughly Americanized: I visit American-style department stores, see advertisements in English, I can almost always ask to speak English with people, it all sounds very convenient to and for me. They have the healthcare and sparkling water they so desperately desired. What\u2019s missing? Why can\u2019t they assimilate?\n\n###Death by 1000 (Cultural) Cuts\n\nAn insightful and heartfelt Reddit comment put the culture-fit problem as something like a multitude of tiny interactions that cause friction for the immigrant and make it clear that they do not \u201cbelong\u201d in that society. In the end, they\u2019re left miserable and desperate for something that brings them comfort and familiarity, a sense of home in a foreign land. That\u2019s hard to quantify, but we can work around it a bit and hopefully get some sense of it. To borrow a little from conflict vs. mistake theory, I see assimilation oftentimes described as a problem to be solved, a set of cultural ideas and language to learn. Germany\u2019s naturalization requirements include B1 German language level and passing a 33-question test. That doesn\u2019t seem like much; a B1 level may be 500 hours total of study, and I see timeframes of months for that. How can a rich American expat fail to integrate anywhere, when the skills they need take just a few months of work?\n\nThe mistake theory view treats assimilation like a set of instructions: cultural problem in, cultural solution out. It treats it like\u2026 well, like a language, you just have to learn it and speak it fluently to fit in. There should be no reason that one cannot assimilate into any and every culture, you only need to learn the cultural framework to give the right answers at the right time. I\u2019d even say it treats it like a [Chinese room] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room) of culture.\n\nBut the Chinese room substitutes external verification for internal motivation. Yeah, you can answer me these questions (thirty) three, but does that mean you understand them? Do you care about them? Even then, does it really make you a citizen? Why would a set of multiple-choice questions denote the bright threshold between our ingroup and outgroup, the citizens and the foreigners? To give you an idea of the test, [check here] (https://www.lebenindeutschland.eu/), it includes such stumpers as \u201cpick out your state\u2019s flag\u201d and \u201cwhat was the war between 1939-1945 called?\u201d. I took the test, despite speaking only minimal German, for a state that I don\u2019t live in and passed with 21/33; it\u2019s just not that hard.\n\nWhat might a conflict theory view suggest? Well, one useful element from it is that the direction of movement is what matters; things never stay the same, conflict is pervasive over scarce resources. Then the struggle is not a matter of fact to be decided with a solution at the end, but a struggle of power. While conflict theory is based on conflict between social groups, I would apply it here to the internal conflict of assimilation: the immigrant, to adjust, does not need just to learn the language and culture but must internalize the \u201cculture\u201d in a generic sense; not a set of rituals to observe but a set of values to hold. Though we have an end in sight but are still missing the process for how to get there.\n\nTo take a stab in the dark, I think identity is a critical part. Inside of you there are two wolves. No, sorry\u2026 Inside of you there are multiple identities belonging to different communities, all with different ranges both in literal distance and figurative human connection distance. I would say that my immediate family is one, but then my father\u2019s family and my mother\u2019s family are different but also communities I belong to, and then my home town with some traditions, and then my state, and then my country, and then the Anglophone community, and so on with overlapping or conflicting portions. But if my immediate family prefers beer to wine, I can go most places in the US and get similar beers, and go to a pub in the UK and also get beer there, it looks to me like the communities overlap each other just fine. And in other ways they don\u2019t; I will never understand the British obsession with pies. But I would contrast that experience to sitting down at a Chinese restaurant and seeing a dish in a script I can\u2019t even sound out with the translation of \u201cfried pig colon,\u201d which is a little unsettling, no matter how good that dish may taste.\n\nSo why would that poor Redditor feel like they don\u2019t belong, like this foreign country operated under completely different values, and why was it so alienating to them? The direct answer is stupid: it IS operating under different values, and they feel like they didn\u2019t belong in the community, but importantly they themselves felt this, it wasn\u2019t something forced on them by that community. The community only had to work within its own cultural framework for itself, and when they try to slot themselves in they just don\u2019t fit. I don\u2019t claim it is good or fair, but it is what it is.\n\nSo why do some integrate, and some not? How did my spouse, here with me, transition from depression to happiness? Part of it is always stress, and the energy-sapping ways having to work harder to do mundane things; as we adjusted and learned, everything became easier, and the major hurdles like waiting for residency cards were cleared. But I think a big part of it is being willing to start seeing yourself as part of a different community, and not just learning about it but adjusting yourself to accept it. In the conflict theory view, your disparate communities can only fight for power over your identity, of which there is only so much to go around; assimilation comes when something wins out to create an uneasy peace.\n\nWhy don\u2019t children have as much trouble assimilating as they grow up? I\u2019m sure some feel \u201cout of place,\u201d but I would bet that the even the unhappy child fits in better than an average expat. But children don\u2019t have preconceived, fully-formed identities fresh out of the box, they grow and develop them over time, and when embedded in a culture they usually take up an identity that is compatible with it. But a child should still be suffering under these 1000 cuts, right? They still must learn the culture. But I suspect that for a child, having the identity in place, without competing with another established identity, means that they are just learning and feel at home even if they don\u2019t know everything. For them, there is no identity conflict.\n\n###The Identity Conflict versus a National Identity\n\nWhat does an identity conflict look like? How do these cultural wounds manifest? I\u2019ll focus in on one topic here: food. Everyone eats, normally a few times a day, so it\u2019s inescapable. But at the same time, food is heavily nationally coded; right now I can open up a delivery app and filter restaurants not just by price or distance but by nationality. We talk about \u201ccomfort foods\u201d and \u201cnational dishes.\u201d We reference \u201cabuela\u2019s\u201d or \u201cnonna\u2019s\u201d or \u201coma\u2019s\u201d cooking. I think it\u2019s as good a point as any.\n\nI can walk into a butcher shop in Germany and ask for Rinderrouladen, one of my favorite dishes that my grandmother made consisting of beef slices rolled up with mustard, onion, pickle and bacon; they will correct me that I must have meant the beef slices, I assent, and they produce the requested number of slices from the right cut of beef without me having to explain the details. They will then ask if I want the bacon slices for it too. We both know what Rinderrouladen is, what goes into it, and everything works harmoniously. I can walk into a grocery store and browse at all the different sauerkraut options, then have an old lady come up to me and give me advice as to which brand is best (the store brand, apparently). I can even travel to Dresden to stumble over Eisbein, a pickled ham hock, and find out that it is almost exactly like the Christmas ham we had back home. It\u2019s uncanny, but it\u2019s also unbelievably comfortable; Germany is constantly reinforcing that I belong, that this is like home, that I will never be left pining for a taste of comfort food.\n\nOne of my colleagues is Muslim, not Turkish but from the MENA region, and at least moderately devout, including eating halal food. They are perfectly nice, but the differences in food culture were obvious during a work trip. For one, they couldn\u2019t eat anything all day because of Ramadan. Then, I was surprised to find how restrictive the situation can be; not only can they not eat any pork, but they couldn\u2019t eat other meat because it wasn\u2019t killed in the required fashion; their sad story was of eating pizza four days a week on the work campus because that was the only vegetarian option. And they naturally gravitated towards places that served food like theirs from their home, staffed by people who spoke Arabic like them and kept food halal like they required. They talked about how things were in their home country and how much easier dealing with the restrictions were, for example if everyone is fasting during Ramadan it\u2019s a shared trial and the culture adapts to it. This seems to be a common experience, that\u2019s clear just by reading the experience of many Turks in Germany, [e.g.] (https://web.archive.org/web/20220120145344/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/world/europe/25turkish.html) where the first sentence about Turks retiring in Germany reads, \u201cThe last cups of Turkish black tea had been drained, the platters of olives and goat cheese cleared, but the snowy-haired Turks lingered at the table.\u201d Or read about the proliferation of the doner kebab! Food is a critical part of national identity.\n\nAs another easily-visible point of difference, many, but not all, of these food differences stem from religious differences, but even in a country with freedom of religion and nominal secularization, Germany remains a religious-ish country. The holidays are mainly based on [Christian holidays] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Germany#List_by_state), and depend on each state, including each state\u2019s primary denomination. In a country with church bells commonly ringing despite the \u201cquiet hours\u201d laws, German are not as comfortable with the [Muslim muezzin, the call to prayer] (https://rmx.news/article/majority-of-germans-rejects-muslim-call-to-prayer-poll/). I went hiking in the Bavarian alps over the summer, and there every hilltop has a cross or small chapel on it. I am unsure what my colleague thinks of all this, but it\u2019s easy for me to see how the undercurrents of religion in a nominally secularized country could cause conflict.\n\nThis colleague is going through the normal naturalization process now. They are taking an integration course, and learning the language. By the quantifiable measurements, they were working harder to integrate than I was. But every time we dealt with anything culturally German, they treated it as strange and foreign, while for me it was normal and comforting. The conflict was not over lack of knowledge, but about lack of internal motivation or identification. And although the integration course might be able to make them speak some German and learn about Germany\u2019s cultural values, I don\u2019t think it can automatically change someone\u2019s internal identity. I can\u2019t peer into their mind, but my colleague might always be from their home country, in their hearts, and no matter how much knowledge of German culture they pick up may treat it as a password to get what they want.\n\nIn Catholicism, I have heard the sacraments (baptism, communion, marriage, etc.) called \u201can outward sign of inward grace.\u201d The physical act of the ritual does not itself bestow grace, but brings it to fruition. I think citizenship is a little like that: a legal declaration of a cultural fact. And while God may be infallible and omniscient, we humans are stuck in the world of, at best, Bayesian inference. Gaining citizenship says that we hope the new cultural identity will win the struggle inside your mind, that by virtue of being physically present in Germany, speaking enough German and knowing the German values, the German identity will overcome any other, or at least come to a peaceful sharing of identity; the certificate at the end is just a marker of something we hope went on inside your head.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t go through any integration course, or have to speak any German, or anything like that. Germany didn\u2019t have to give out citizenship to people in my situation. It has been that way for about 50 years at the youngest for those born in wedlock, and working fine. Why change it? Why take someone like me whose grandparent came from Germany, and give them citizenship? Besides the simplistic answer that some powerful lobbying group got it changed, I think there is a deeper reason why Germany would be willing to make that bet, that the German cultural identity could win out.\n\n###Retvrn to Heimat\n\nMy absolute favorite German word is Heimat, which means \u201chomeland\u201d maybe. [It\u2019s more than that, though] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimat). The Heimat is not just where one is from, but denotes a more significant cultural homeland. I like to make it a -hood word: the neighborhood might be the local people around you, while the nationhood is for everyone in your country or statehood for the state, the Heimat is the cultural home-hood or people-hood, the place where you belong; imagine the phrase \u201cit\u2019s not a house but a home\u201d applied to a society. Germany is not \u201cthe nation my grandparent came from,\u201d or \u201cthe nation I live in,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cthe home nation.\u201d\n\nThe Heimat has some important qualities that make it so powerful. Let me paint in broad strokes here. The Heimat is less physical than temporal and cultural. The Heimat has qualities of timelessness, both in that it can never truly be reached and that it is always changing (I could return to my childhood home, but it will never be the same as when I was a child), but yet it always contains those essential homely elements. It covers that essential need of belonging to a society, ensuring that you are valued and appreciated. It is more rural than urban, more social than physical and more cultural than economic, but overlaps both. I would strongly associate words like idyllic or bucolic with the Heimat and less pure happiness.\n\nThe Heimat is, I think, incredibly resistant to quantification, but still vulnerable to it. I am reminded of [Seeing like a State] (https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/), where the state apparatuses have the power to disrupt the natural, organic processes that have served so well but fail to see why these processes work for the societies that created them. Then the state moves in and destroys what was valuable to those who lived in it in an effort to create value that it can see and tax. I would contrast the Rust Belt to the strong German manufacturing base, as destroyed versus preserved identities.\n\nMy colleague\u2019s Heimat is not Germany, and it probably never will be; they grew up in a different country and have a strong sense of belonging to that country. This is not inherently bad and doesn\u2019t make them a \u201cbad immigrant,\u201d and perhaps their children or grandchildren will grow up in Germany and see things differently. But they aren\u2019t participating in the same culture that most other Germans are, even if they can get around as a permanent outsider. They may, [like so many people] (https://web.archive.org/web/20211127185402/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/reader-center/german-identity.html), never feel like they fit in.\n\nWhy did Germany take the bet on me? I think the concept of the Heimat sheds some light there: Germany was betting that it was my Heimat. That this anchor would let me accept the German identity and thrive in it. That, however tenuous my connection, it would be enough to make it stick. That I would be in my home here. Germany is the one and only ancestral Heimat I get, even if I grew up in the US. When I told my father that I had the certificate, the story he relayed to me was about when his mother was on her deathbed and they were arguing about something political, and he said that he was an American citizen, and she told him no, that he was a German. You just can\u2019t conjure up that connection based on economic principles or a preferred lifestyle. It\u2019s not random, I didn\u2019t weigh the pros and cons of being French vs. German, it just always was.\n\nAnd critically, Germany will always be the Heimat. Someone who came here for a better-paying job might leave if the economy falters. Someone who came because they appreciate the German stereotypes of punctuality or organization would run after dealing with the Deutsche Bahn\u2019s chronic train delays or after the first six-month wait to hear anything from the Foreigner\u2019s Authority. Someone who came for politics might find that the political winds change, and what then? I think it\u2019s entirely related to Germany discouraging dual nationality, such as in naturalization. No one can serve two masters it seems. But I\u2019m stuck with it, as are most Germans, and that commitment adds value.\nFinally, I feel that I should give another point of view of the Heimat, one that claims the concept of Heimat is [inherently exclusionary] (https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153953/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/books/max-czollek-germany-desintegriert-euch.html//). I would say that the concept requires some exclusion; I don\u2019t think it would be possible for people to share all possible values with everyone, as some are in conflict with each other, but a core part of the conflict will also come from a conflict of identities in my view.\n\nThe point of Germany being the Heimat isn\u2019t that I naturally came in knowing everything. I knew a little, but there was a huge breadth of culture that I had to adapt to even beyond learning the language. But because I already had some seed of the right identity, there was no conflict; I didn\u2019t have to build up a new identity or destroy my old one, I only had to learn, like a child. So, although I still had to do the work, I haven\u2019t felt the sense as much of \u201cnot belonging\u201d or feeling too much like an outsider; it is a thing to learn not an obstacle to overcome.\n\n###Closeout\n\nI hope that was enjoyable for everyone. I am just one little opinion awash in a sea of them, but I think my path to citizenship was also a bit unique. The StAG \u00a7 5 declaration is pretty new still but was a path to citizenship that was very unexpected for me; it felt like being handed a winning lottery ticket, something I didn\u2019t necessarily deserve, but it still feels right now that it\u2019s complete. I don\u2019t speak much German, but I comfort myself in knowing that I speak more than most Germans did when they became citizens, and look forward to learning more. And for anyone else with recent German ancestry looking to do the same, the law is only available for the next 9 years.\n\nAs far as citizenship vs. identity goes, I stick to my thesis that citizenship is a hopeful claim by the government that you have implanted the right identity into your head to truly assimilate into that culture. And I think Germany is an interesting nation and culture to examine as it has a very different history of immigration compared to e.g. the US, UK or France. More broadly, the ideas of identity and belonging could be applied to other communities.\n\nI have tried to avoid culture warring in this post, but I know immigration is a CW hot-topic. I would prefer to focus this post on the more general topics of identity and citizenship, but I would be happy to talk about CW-related stuff in the culture war roundup thread. But here I'd love to hear from others, especially Germans and their perspectives or from other countries, and those who have also moved and dealt with issues of identity and citizenship.", "author_fullname": "t2_2it1e4th", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Reflection on Becaming a German Citizen", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_x2hhw1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 59, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 59, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661962199.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello fellow Mottizans, I have emerged from my lurker cave to share good news with you all: I have become a German citizen! But not through naturalization or birth; I used an uncommon route with a new and somewhat strange process: a StAG section (\u00a7) 5 declaration. While going through this, I had learned a lot about that citizenship laws of Germany and some comparisons with other countries, as well as spending (too much) time browsing various expat and citizenship forums and subreddits. I\u2019d like to &lt;del&gt;subject you to&lt;/del&gt; share with you what I\u2019ve learned in this weird journey, through intergenerational citizenship and questions of national identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With so many immigrants out there, why should you listen to me, an American moving between western countries? Well, I, personally, value it more when people put in effort for something with less assured payoff; few want to split lottery tickets, everyone wants to split the winnings. Similarly, I moved to Germany as someone with only German heritage, as a normal immigrant, and then more than a year after that a new law offered me a privileged path to citizenship through legal magic. In short, I committed to Germany and then received the winning lottery ticket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bit more about my path: I moved to Germany in 2020 with the &lt;a href=\"https://www.bamf.de/EN/Themen/MigrationAufenthalt/ZuwandererDrittstaaten/Migrathek/BlaueKarteEU/blauekarteeu-node.html\"&gt;EU Blue Card&lt;/a&gt; for highly qualified immigrants. I chose Germany because part of my family was from Germany, and in the typical American style I considered myself German-American. I had visited Germany and liked it, although I knew visiting and living somewhere are two very different things. But what I would really like to stress is that visiting Germany felt like visiting a home, a place that felt natural. I\u2019ve visited plenty of other countries, and everywhere else it was clear that they were foreign, \u201calien\u201d countries. It was obvious when I was in Japan that no matter how much I might like visiting castles or eating ramen, Japan would remain a foreign country. When it was unclear whether I would be still working in Germany, a friend suggested that I work with them in the Netherlands, and a big hangup was that the Netherlands was a foreign country, this despite the fact that they speak more English and I would be around more English-speaking expats. Germany was the ancestral homeland, and no other country could ever replace that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;German citizenship is based primarily on &lt;em&gt;jus sanguinis&lt;/em&gt;, citizenship by blood: someone is a German citizen at birth because their parents were citizens. But this was, in the past, primarily patrilineal. In fact, the German citizenship in my family was cut off when my German grandmother married a foreigner: she automatically lost her German citizenship, rendering her stateless and all her children non-Germans, including my father, and all of her grandchildren were not German either, including me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In August 2021 Germany passed an amendment to the Staatsangeh\u00f6rigkeitsgesetz (StAG), or nationality law. The new StAG \u00a7 5 allows those who, to quote the federal authority, \u201cwere previously excluded by gender-discriminatory regulations from acquiring German citizenship at birth may now acquire it by &lt;a href=\"https://www.bva.bund.de/EN/Services/Citizens/ID-Documents-Law/Citizenship/4_StAG/german_citizenship_law.html\"&gt;way of declaration.&lt;/a&gt; Briefly, the post-war German Basic Law (a constitution) forbids gender discrimination, and so those who were excluded from acquiring citizenship due to this gender discrimination could &lt;a href=\"https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stag/englisch_stag.html\"&gt;claim it back&lt;/a&gt;; for example, until 1975, German women would not pass down citizenship by default. The process is new enough that the relevant authority here in Germany, in a major city, did not know about it. But I collected all of our old documents, submitted my application, and now (as of the time of writing) the certificate is in the mail in hand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did it, I became a German citizen! I did not naturalize, I gained citizenship through declaration (queue up, \u201cI didn\u2019t say citizenship, I declared it!\u201d). I did not have to reside in Germany for 6-8 years, I did not have to speak German, pass any test, pay any money or do anything at all but submit a few documents and citizenship was handed down in a puff of magical legal smoke by a bureaucrat I\u2019ve never met before. If I suffered some brain damage I could commit terrorism or racially motivated crimes, things that would have excluded me before, and still keep the citizenship (I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll test that though). And my children will also be German citizens from birth, and their children, and so on forever, just as it had been passed down to me from forever ago (well, at least since 1871).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But importantly, I haven\u2019t been saying that I became German. I don\u2019t speak German, I didn\u2019t grow up in Germany, and neither did my parents. By the Basic Law, I am a German because I hold German citizenship, but I try to look past the purely legal standing. I don\u2019t think the idea of who is German has a really clear and universal answer; different people and different Germans give different answers. Perhaps we can talk about the traits of Germans, but until we have access to the pure and perfect German Form, arguments are really all we can get. I will reference that concept of being a German plenty though, and the legal vs. cultural German.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gives my background and stake in the matter, and it will make for a nice dinner party story but isn\u2019t that important. In fact, nothing really changes legally for me anyway, my permit covered it all before. I think it\u2019s much more interesting to talk about what I\u2019ve learned along the way, as it might actually be interesting and useful for everyone else. So here it goes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Strangeness of Descent Laws&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;German citizenship by descent is a mess, but it\u2019s interesting to take a little dip into the law. Before I only said that German citizenship is based on descent, which glosses over many of the complications that arise in tracing that path. A nice guide on the process can be found &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/citizenship\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The US (and most countries in the Americas) use primarily jus soli or birthright citizenship, i.e. you are a citizen of a country if you are born in that country, but also has &lt;a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Acquisition-US-Citizenship-Child-Born-Abroad.html\"&gt;citizenship by descent&lt;/a&gt;. But it\u2019s much more restrictive; in particular, while German citizenship by descent is basically limitless, US citizenship by descent requires that if e.g. the child has two citizen parents, at least one resided in the US at any point, or if only one parent is a US citizen they must have resided in the US for at least five years. I call this a \u201csunset clause\u201d in citizenship, something that terminates citizenship automatically without a connection to the home country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without a solid sunset clause in the German citizenship by descent, you get some (in my personal view) strange lines of descent. Someone whose great-great-great-grandfather left Germany in the late 1800s can be a German citizen directly if it happens to pass only through the male line in key years. Compare this to someone whose German mother married a foreigner and they were born in 1948; their path to citizenship would be under StAG \u00a714, and they have to establish a close connection to Germany, such as speaking German and having close family members in Germany. Here we see that you can only be a legal German if you establish that you are already a cultural German. Add on to this complications such as if your parents naturalized before or after you were born, if you served in a foreign military, if you every voluntarily gained citizenship of another country, and it gets complicated. To note, Germany has added a sunset clause: if a German citizen is born abroad after 1999, any of their children born abroad only retain German citizenship if the authorities are notified before the &lt;a href=\"https://www.germany.info/us-en/service/03-Citizenship/german-citizenship-acquired-through-notification-of-birth-occuring-abroad/943378\"&gt;child\u2019s first birthday&lt;/a&gt;. No more surprise citizenships by descent a hundred years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this has led to a lot of people sorting through old paperwork to find out if they are secretly German citizens or can become one. I like to point to the growth of &lt;a href=\"/r/GermanCitizenship\"&gt;r/GermanCitizenship&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"https://subredditstats.com/r/germancitizenship\"&gt;part of it&lt;/a&gt;, but the perhaps better known example is for Italy, where it is popular enough to have consular wait times in years and a &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220621175345/https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-citizenship-007-documents-francesco-curione/index.html\"&gt;CNN article about it&lt;/a&gt;. I\u2019ll just voice my personal opinion that all of this is a little strange to me; when one out of sixteen or thirty-two of your ancestors at a particular level came from a particular country, it\u2019s hard for me to see where exactly your connection comes in. The legal case may be perfectly fine, but the cultural part falls through. I normally see it chalked up to \u201chonoring ancestors\u201d or \u201ckeeping their memory alive,\u201d which turns into an excuse to have a nice passport and travel the EU visa-free as far as I\u2019ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I should mention that Germany, in principle, discourages dual citizenship. If you naturalize, you normally must give up other citizenships, if it is possible and doesn\u2019t cause undue hardship. Notably, the fees to renounce US citizenship are high enough that the authorities may permit you to keep US citizenship if you make less per month than the fees, $2,350. It also permits dual citizenship if other citizenships were gained automatically, i.e. from birthright. There are many exceptions nowadays, but the principle still exists, and causes problems sometimes when e.g. people are forced to &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210220071357/https:/www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/world/europe/16iht-letter16.html\"&gt;choose a nationality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I will point out that StAG \u00a75 vs. \u00a714 (post- vs. pre- Basic Law) seems weird to me. A German woman could lose her citizenship by marrying a foreigner in e.g. 1947, have a child in 1948 then one in 1950; the first would have to prove their ties to Germany, while the second would get in without any restrictions, but in both cases the relevant legal situation that caused the loss of citizenship is the same and only stopped in 1950(ish). For the second child, the claim would be that because the Basic Law forbids gender discrimination, they were unfairly discriminated because they should have been able to obtain citizenship from a female parent. I\u2019m not a jurist but the legal idea seems fraught: how could laws prohibiting an action in the future justify retroactive corrections? But \u00a75 covers much more than that, affecting people born as late as 1993.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the biggest takeaway from all of this is that I have the impression that citizenship laws oftentimes are capricious and arbitrary, relying on old documents that some may or may not have and offering various paths or restrictions that change over time. Countries try to both preserve a legal basis for citizenship while trying to reasonably restrict it, while working under changing social views and massive changes in the way the world works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think a look at the citizenship laws is helpful mostly to find out that they don\u2019t really answer anything but a legal question, which is important but not what I\u2019m after. I hope no one thinks that someone born to a German mother and a foreign father in 1974 is definitely not a citizen while a sibling born in 1976 definitely is, even if the legal situation is clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Reddit Expatriation Community&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s enough about citizenship laws then. I was fascinated by (potential) immigrants, especially on Reddit, that I came across in my browsing. As an American, I grew up with the idea that America was the land of immigration and that immigration only really flowed one-way. I think the statistics bears this out, with the US having one of the lowest shares of its &lt;a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/4237/the-countries-with-the-most-people-living-overseas/\"&gt;population living abroad&lt;/a&gt;. Why would someone leave the freest and richest country?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is changing, slowly. As other countries become richer, it becomes less clear that America is the automatic best option, and it is probably easier; I can do things like videocall my parents every week and translate written text on my phone, things that make it vastly easier to emigrate. And let\u2019s be clear, the advantage of being a natural Anglophone is huge. On Reddit, which I think is primarily dominated by Americans and Anglophones in general, some of the migration-focused subreddits have seen a lot of growth: &lt;a href=\"https://subredditstats.com/r/amerexit\"&gt;Amerexit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://subredditstats.com/r/iwantout\"&gt;iwantout&lt;/a&gt;,and &lt;a href=\"https://subredditstats.com/r/expats\"&gt;expats&lt;/a&gt;. Those are my three favorite (or at least most entertaining) subreddits, and they run the gamut from \u201cAmerica sucks, I want to leave!\u201d to \u201cHow can I leave my current country (serious answers only)?\u201d to \u201cLiving in a foreign country sucks in so many ways.\u201d Pick your favorite, I guess. And like in everything else, politics is the mind-poison in immigration. But there are many common themes; I\u2019ll reference posts without linking to avoid inter-subreddit drama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think most of these immigrants, and probably most immigrants in general, are what I would call \u201cmaterialist immigrants.\u201d Most people are looking to improve their economic situation or living standards. How they rate these things is up to them; someone may value high salaries directly, while others value more consistent healthcare coverage or walkable neighborhoods. If they\u2019re from a western country they may consider themselves (and others like them) an &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=expat+vs+immigrant+reddit\"&gt;expat instead of an immigrant&lt;/a&gt;, but it all amounts to the same thing. Even that German citizenship guide I linked before explains the benefits of becoming a German citizen in almost &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/citizenship#wiki_benefits_of_german_citizenship\"&gt;purely economic terms&lt;/a&gt;: live and work in the EU! Travel visa-free in so many places with a German passport! Go to university for free! If you\u2019re destitute, Germany will take care of you! Drawbacks: none, you don\u2019t have to learn German or pay any taxes or do anything at all for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the discussions reflect this living-standard/economic focus, and an entirely Ameri-centric view. Currently in &lt;a href=\"/r/AmerExit\"&gt;r/AmerExit&lt;/a&gt;, someone is hating on the US because\u2026 (checks subreddit) they can find cheap mineral water while on vacation in Italy. No, I\u2019m not joking, it\u2019s the first point in a top post at the time of writing. Someone may fear American politics enough to instead move to Turkey, a country that literally went through an attempted military coup in 2016 and has a nice book review regarding &lt;a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-new-sultan\"&gt;Erdogan-as-dictator on ACX&lt;/a&gt;. Or a contemporary favorite, overlooking the fact that many countries have more strict abortion laws than some US states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When looking for somewhere to go, I see so often that people think of moving to completely different countries, treating them all the same as if \u201cwestern European\u201d covered everything they need. One person might say Germany and\u2026 Wales? How about the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Germany, France or the UK? Another might want to move to Ireland or Scandinavia, but they speak fluent Spanish. Countries are interchangeable, as long as they have some greenery, good weather and everyone there aligns with their values. Everyone is \u201cwilling to learn the language,\u201d a completely costless declaration that I always translate to, \u201cI may learn to swim if you throw me in the middle of the ocean.\u201d Even at the end of the natural process, I can see someone declare that they are finally an \u201cEU citizen\u201d after eight years as if their citizenship was granted by Brussels and not their home country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond the standard internet/Reddit stupidity, these feel like they cover an individualist- and money-focused worldview. And it naturally feeds materialist immigration that disregards the people who actually live in these places, which causes critical problems in adjusting to a life in a foreign country. Remember what I said about &lt;a href=\"/r/expats\"&gt;r/expats&lt;/a&gt;? It\u2019s the opposite version of &lt;a href=\"/r/AmerExit\"&gt;r/AmerExit&lt;/a&gt;, where people have gone to a foreign country and found that, yeah, it\u2019s not America. This is what happens in the culture-clash. The day-to-day reality of living in a country that sees the sun for a few hours a day in the winter sets in. Of dealing with people who will always treat you like a foreigner. Of being far away from family and former friends. It\u2019s tough to live somewhere far away from home, and it\u2019s tough to know that before you actually make the move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But\u2026 why is it tough? I haven\u2019t seen many expats complaining about their jobs, most complain about the people around them and their social life. And the world seems very thoroughly Americanized: I visit American-style department stores, see advertisements in English, I can almost always ask to speak English with people, it all sounds very convenient to and for me. They have the healthcare and sparkling water they so desperately desired. What\u2019s missing? Why can\u2019t they assimilate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Death by 1000 (Cultural) Cuts&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An insightful and heartfelt Reddit comment put the culture-fit problem as something like a multitude of tiny interactions that cause friction for the immigrant and make it clear that they do not \u201cbelong\u201d in that society. In the end, they\u2019re left miserable and desperate for something that brings them comfort and familiarity, a sense of home in a foreign land. That\u2019s hard to quantify, but we can work around it a bit and hopefully get some sense of it. To borrow a little from conflict vs. mistake theory, I see assimilation oftentimes described as a problem to be solved, a set of cultural ideas and language to learn. Germany\u2019s naturalization requirements include B1 German language level and passing a 33-question test. That doesn\u2019t seem like much; a B1 level may be 500 hours total of study, and I see timeframes of months for that. How can a rich American expat fail to integrate anywhere, when the skills they need take just a few months of work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mistake theory view treats assimilation like a set of instructions: cultural problem in, cultural solution out. It treats it like\u2026 well, like a language, you just have to learn it and speak it fluently to fit in. There should be no reason that one cannot assimilate into any and every culture, you only need to learn the cultural framework to give the right answers at the right time. I\u2019d even say it treats it like a &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room\"&gt;Chinese room&lt;/a&gt; of culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the Chinese room substitutes external verification for internal motivation. Yeah, you can answer me these questions (thirty) three, but does that mean you understand them? Do you care about them? Even then, does it really make you a citizen? Why would a set of multiple-choice questions denote the bright threshold between our ingroup and outgroup, the citizens and the foreigners? To give you an idea of the test, &lt;a href=\"https://www.lebenindeutschland.eu/\"&gt;check here&lt;/a&gt;, it includes such stumpers as \u201cpick out your state\u2019s flag\u201d and \u201cwhat was the war between 1939-1945 called?\u201d. I took the test, despite speaking only minimal German, for a state that I don\u2019t live in and passed with 21/33; it\u2019s just not that hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What might a conflict theory view suggest? Well, one useful element from it is that the direction of movement is what matters; things never stay the same, conflict is pervasive over scarce resources. Then the struggle is not a matter of fact to be decided with a solution at the end, but a struggle of power. While conflict theory is based on conflict between social groups, I would apply it here to the internal conflict of assimilation: the immigrant, to adjust, does not need just to learn the language and culture but must internalize the \u201cculture\u201d in a generic sense; not a set of rituals to observe but a set of values to hold. Though we have an end in sight but are still missing the process for how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To take a stab in the dark, I think identity is a critical part. Inside of you there are two wolves. No, sorry\u2026 Inside of you there are multiple identities belonging to different communities, all with different ranges both in literal distance and figurative human connection distance. I would say that my immediate family is one, but then my father\u2019s family and my mother\u2019s family are different but also communities I belong to, and then my home town with some traditions, and then my state, and then my country, and then the Anglophone community, and so on with overlapping or conflicting portions. But if my immediate family prefers beer to wine, I can go most places in the US and get similar beers, and go to a pub in the UK and also get beer there, it looks to me like the communities overlap each other just fine. And in other ways they don\u2019t; I will never understand the British obsession with pies. But I would contrast that experience to sitting down at a Chinese restaurant and seeing a dish in a script I can\u2019t even sound out with the translation of \u201cfried pig colon,\u201d which is a little unsettling, no matter how good that dish may taste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why would that poor Redditor feel like they don\u2019t belong, like this foreign country operated under completely different values, and why was it so alienating to them? The direct answer is stupid: it IS operating under different values, and they feel like they didn\u2019t belong in the community, but importantly they themselves felt this, it wasn\u2019t something forced on them by that community. The community only had to work within its own cultural framework for itself, and when they try to slot themselves in they just don\u2019t fit. I don\u2019t claim it is good or fair, but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why do some integrate, and some not? How did my spouse, here with me, transition from depression to happiness? Part of it is always stress, and the energy-sapping ways having to work harder to do mundane things; as we adjusted and learned, everything became easier, and the major hurdles like waiting for residency cards were cleared. But I think a big part of it is being willing to start seeing yourself as part of a different community, and not just learning about it but adjusting yourself to accept it. In the conflict theory view, your disparate communities can only fight for power over your identity, of which there is only so much to go around; assimilation comes when something wins out to create an uneasy peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why don\u2019t children have as much trouble assimilating as they grow up? I\u2019m sure some feel \u201cout of place,\u201d but I would bet that the even the unhappy child fits in better than an average expat. But children don\u2019t have preconceived, fully-formed identities fresh out of the box, they grow and develop them over time, and when embedded in a culture they usually take up an identity that is compatible with it. But a child should still be suffering under these 1000 cuts, right? They still must learn the culture. But I suspect that for a child, having the identity in place, without competing with another established identity, means that they are just learning and feel at home even if they don\u2019t know everything. For them, there is no identity conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Identity Conflict versus a National Identity&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does an identity conflict look like? How do these cultural wounds manifest? I\u2019ll focus in on one topic here: food. Everyone eats, normally a few times a day, so it\u2019s inescapable. But at the same time, food is heavily nationally coded; right now I can open up a delivery app and filter restaurants not just by price or distance but by nationality. We talk about \u201ccomfort foods\u201d and \u201cnational dishes.\u201d We reference \u201cabuela\u2019s\u201d or \u201cnonna\u2019s\u201d or \u201coma\u2019s\u201d cooking. I think it\u2019s as good a point as any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can walk into a butcher shop in Germany and ask for Rinderrouladen, one of my favorite dishes that my grandmother made consisting of beef slices rolled up with mustard, onion, pickle and bacon; they will correct me that I must have meant the beef slices, I assent, and they produce the requested number of slices from the right cut of beef without me having to explain the details. They will then ask if I want the bacon slices for it too. We both know what Rinderrouladen is, what goes into it, and everything works harmoniously. I can walk into a grocery store and browse at all the different sauerkraut options, then have an old lady come up to me and give me advice as to which brand is best (the store brand, apparently). I can even travel to Dresden to stumble over Eisbein, a pickled ham hock, and find out that it is almost exactly like the Christmas ham we had back home. It\u2019s uncanny, but it\u2019s also unbelievably comfortable; Germany is constantly reinforcing that I belong, that this is like home, that I will never be left pining for a taste of comfort food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my colleagues is Muslim, not Turkish but from the MENA region, and at least moderately devout, including eating halal food. They are perfectly nice, but the differences in food culture were obvious during a work trip. For one, they couldn\u2019t eat anything all day because of Ramadan. Then, I was surprised to find how restrictive the situation can be; not only can they not eat any pork, but they couldn\u2019t eat other meat because it wasn\u2019t killed in the required fashion; their sad story was of eating pizza four days a week on the work campus because that was the only vegetarian option. And they naturally gravitated towards places that served food like theirs from their home, staffed by people who spoke Arabic like them and kept food halal like they required. They talked about how things were in their home country and how much easier dealing with the restrictions were, for example if everyone is fasting during Ramadan it\u2019s a shared trial and the culture adapts to it. This seems to be a common experience, that\u2019s clear just by reading the experience of many Turks in Germany, &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220120145344/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/world/europe/25turkish.html\"&gt;e.g.&lt;/a&gt; where the first sentence about Turks retiring in Germany reads, \u201cThe last cups of Turkish black tea had been drained, the platters of olives and goat cheese cleared, but the snowy-haired Turks lingered at the table.\u201d Or read about the proliferation of the doner kebab! Food is a critical part of national identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As another easily-visible point of difference, many, but not all, of these food differences stem from religious differences, but even in a country with freedom of religion and nominal secularization, Germany remains a religious-ish country. The holidays are mainly based on &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Germany#List_by_state\"&gt;Christian holidays&lt;/a&gt;, and depend on each state, including each state\u2019s primary denomination. In a country with church bells commonly ringing despite the \u201cquiet hours\u201d laws, German are not as comfortable with the &lt;a href=\"https://rmx.news/article/majority-of-germans-rejects-muslim-call-to-prayer-poll/\"&gt;Muslim muezzin, the call to prayer&lt;/a&gt;. I went hiking in the Bavarian alps over the summer, and there every hilltop has a cross or small chapel on it. I am unsure what my colleague thinks of all this, but it\u2019s easy for me to see how the undercurrents of religion in a nominally secularized country could cause conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This colleague is going through the normal naturalization process now. They are taking an integration course, and learning the language. By the quantifiable measurements, they were working harder to integrate than I was. But every time we dealt with anything culturally German, they treated it as strange and foreign, while for me it was normal and comforting. The conflict was not over lack of knowledge, but about lack of internal motivation or identification. And although the integration course might be able to make them speak some German and learn about Germany\u2019s cultural values, I don\u2019t think it can automatically change someone\u2019s internal identity. I can\u2019t peer into their mind, but my colleague might always be from their home country, in their hearts, and no matter how much knowledge of German culture they pick up may treat it as a password to get what they want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Catholicism, I have heard the sacraments (baptism, communion, marriage, etc.) called \u201can outward sign of inward grace.\u201d The physical act of the ritual does not itself bestow grace, but brings it to fruition. I think citizenship is a little like that: a legal declaration of a cultural fact. And while God may be infallible and omniscient, we humans are stuck in the world of, at best, Bayesian inference. Gaining citizenship says that we hope the new cultural identity will win the struggle inside your mind, that by virtue of being physically present in Germany, speaking enough German and knowing the German values, the German identity will overcome any other, or at least come to a peaceful sharing of identity; the certificate at the end is just a marker of something we hope went on inside your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn\u2019t go through any integration course, or have to speak any German, or anything like that. Germany didn\u2019t have to give out citizenship to people in my situation. It has been that way for about 50 years at the youngest for those born in wedlock, and working fine. Why change it? Why take someone like me whose grandparent came from Germany, and give them citizenship? Besides the simplistic answer that some powerful lobbying group got it changed, I think there is a deeper reason why Germany would be willing to make that bet, that the German cultural identity could win out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Retvrn to Heimat&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My absolute favorite German word is Heimat, which means \u201chomeland\u201d maybe. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimat\"&gt;It\u2019s more than that, though&lt;/a&gt;. The Heimat is not just where one is from, but denotes a more significant cultural homeland. I like to make it a -hood word: the neighborhood might be the local people around you, while the nationhood is for everyone in your country or statehood for the state, the Heimat is the cultural home-hood or people-hood, the place where you belong; imagine the phrase \u201cit\u2019s not a house but a home\u201d applied to a society. Germany is not \u201cthe nation my grandparent came from,\u201d or \u201cthe nation I live in,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cthe home nation.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Heimat has some important qualities that make it so powerful. Let me paint in broad strokes here. The Heimat is less physical than temporal and cultural. The Heimat has qualities of timelessness, both in that it can never truly be reached and that it is always changing (I could return to my childhood home, but it will never be the same as when I was a child), but yet it always contains those essential homely elements. It covers that essential need of belonging to a society, ensuring that you are valued and appreciated. It is more rural than urban, more social than physical and more cultural than economic, but overlaps both. I would strongly associate words like idyllic or bucolic with the Heimat and less pure happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Heimat is, I think, incredibly resistant to quantification, but still vulnerable to it. I am reminded of &lt;a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/\"&gt;Seeing like a State&lt;/a&gt;, where the state apparatuses have the power to disrupt the natural, organic processes that have served so well but fail to see why these processes work for the societies that created them. Then the state moves in and destroys what was valuable to those who lived in it in an effort to create value that it can see and tax. I would contrast the Rust Belt to the strong German manufacturing base, as destroyed versus preserved identities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My colleague\u2019s Heimat is not Germany, and it probably never will be; they grew up in a different country and have a strong sense of belonging to that country. This is not inherently bad and doesn\u2019t make them a \u201cbad immigrant,\u201d and perhaps their children or grandchildren will grow up in Germany and see things differently. But they aren\u2019t participating in the same culture that most other Germans are, even if they can get around as a permanent outsider. They may, &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20211127185402/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/reader-center/german-identity.html\"&gt;like so many people&lt;/a&gt;, never feel like they fit in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did Germany take the bet on me? I think the concept of the Heimat sheds some light there: Germany was betting that it was my Heimat. That this anchor would let me accept the German identity and thrive in it. That, however tenuous my connection, it would be enough to make it stick. That I would be in my home here. Germany is the one and only ancestral Heimat I get, even if I grew up in the US. When I told my father that I had the certificate, the story he relayed to me was about when his mother was on her deathbed and they were arguing about something political, and he said that he was an American citizen, and she told him no, that he was a German. You just can\u2019t conjure up that connection based on economic principles or a preferred lifestyle. It\u2019s not random, I didn\u2019t weigh the pros and cons of being French vs. German, it just always was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And critically, Germany will always be the Heimat. Someone who came here for a better-paying job might leave if the economy falters. Someone who came because they appreciate the German stereotypes of punctuality or organization would run after dealing with the Deutsche Bahn\u2019s chronic train delays or after the first six-month wait to hear anything from the Foreigner\u2019s Authority. Someone who came for politics might find that the political winds change, and what then? I think it\u2019s entirely related to Germany discouraging dual nationality, such as in naturalization. No one can serve two masters it seems. But I\u2019m stuck with it, as are most Germans, and that commitment adds value.\nFinally, I feel that I should give another point of view of the Heimat, one that claims the concept of Heimat is &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153953/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/books/max-czollek-germany-desintegriert-euch.html//\"&gt;inherently exclusionary&lt;/a&gt;. I would say that the concept requires some exclusion; I don\u2019t think it would be possible for people to share all possible values with everyone, as some are in conflict with each other, but a core part of the conflict will also come from a conflict of identities in my view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point of Germany being the Heimat isn\u2019t that I naturally came in knowing everything. I knew a little, but there was a huge breadth of culture that I had to adapt to even beyond learning the language. But because I already had some seed of the right identity, there was no conflict; I didn\u2019t have to build up a new identity or destroy my old one, I only had to learn, like a child. So, although I still had to do the work, I haven\u2019t felt the sense as much of \u201cnot belonging\u201d or feeling too much like an outsider; it is a thing to learn not an obstacle to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Closeout&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope that was enjoyable for everyone. I am just one little opinion awash in a sea of them, but I think my path to citizenship was also a bit unique. The StAG \u00a7 5 declaration is pretty new still but was a path to citizenship that was very unexpected for me; it felt like being handed a winning lottery ticket, something I didn\u2019t necessarily deserve, but it still feels right now that it\u2019s complete. I don\u2019t speak much German, but I comfort myself in knowing that I speak more than most Germans did when they became citizens, and look forward to learning more. And for anyone else with recent German ancestry looking to do the same, the law is only available for the next 9 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as citizenship vs. identity goes, I stick to my thesis that citizenship is a hopeful claim by the government that you have implanted the right identity into your head to truly assimilate into that culture. And I think Germany is an interesting nation and culture to examine as it has a very different history of immigration compared to e.g. the US, UK or France. More broadly, the ideas of identity and belonging could be applied to other communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have tried to avoid culture warring in this post, but I know immigration is a CW hot-topic. I would prefer to focus this post on the more general topics of identity and citizenship, but I would be happy to talk about CW-related stuff in the culture war roundup thread. But here I&amp;#39;d love to hear from others, especially Germans and their perspectives or from other countries, and those who have also moved and dealt with issues of identity and citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.

['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 29, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_x0hc17", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 43, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661753708.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

Examples of waging the Culture War:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Attempting to &amp;#39;build consensus&amp;#39; or enforce ideological conformity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recruiting for a cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Posting links that could be summarized as &amp;#39;Boo outgroup!&amp;#39; Basically, if your content is &amp;#39;Can you believe what Those People did this week?&amp;#39; then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or &lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man\"&gt;steel-man&lt;/a&gt; the relevant viewpoint.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don&amp;#39;t paraphrase unflatteringly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at &lt;a href=\"/r/TheThread\"&gt;r/TheThread&lt;/a&gt;. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on &amp;#39;report&amp;#39; at the bottom of the post, selecting &amp;#39;this breaks &lt;a href=\"/r/themotte\"&gt;r/themotte&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s rules, or is of interest to the mods&amp;#39; from the pop-up menu and then selecting &amp;#39;Actually a quality contribution&amp;#39; from the sub-menu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locking Your Own Posts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We&amp;#39;ve got a solution for you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they&amp;#39;re long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For each post &lt;em&gt;except the last one&lt;/em&gt;, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase &lt;code&gt;automod_multipart_lockme&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can then edit it to remove that phrase and it&amp;#39;ll stay locked. This means that &lt;em&gt;you cannot unlock your post on your own&lt;/em&gt;, so make sure you do this &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;ve posted your entire series. Also, don&amp;#39;t lock the last one or people can&amp;#39;t respond to you. &lt;em&gt;Also&lt;/em&gt;, this gets reported to the mods, so don&amp;#39;t abuse it or we&amp;#39;ll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\"&gt;https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redditsearch.io/\"&gt;RedditSearch.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://camas.unddit.com/\"&gt;Camas Reddit Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Append &lt;code&gt;?sort=old&amp;amp;depth=1&lt;/code&gt;

I gave at [ESPR](https://espr-camp.org/), in preparation for a Fermithon, i.e., a Fermi estimates tournament.*\n\nFermi estimation is a method for arriving an estimate of an uncertain variable of interest. Given a variable of interest, sometimes you can decompose it into steps, and multiplying those steps together gives you a more accurate estimate than estimating the thing you want to know directly. I'll go through a proof sketch for this at the end of the post.\n\nIf you want to take over the world, why should you care about this? Well, you may care about this if you hope that having better models of the world would lead you to make better decisions, and to better achieve your goals. And Fermi estimates are one way of training or showing off the skill of building models of the world. They have fast feedback loops, because you can in many cases then check the answer on the internet afterwards. But they are probably most useful in cases where you can't.\n\nThe rest of the class was a trial by fire: I presented some questions, students gave their own estimates, and then briefly discussed them. In case you want to give it a try before seeing the answers, the questions I considered were:\n\n1. How many people have covid in the UK right now (2022-08-20)?\n2. How many cumulative person years did people live in/under the Soviet Union?\n3. How many intelligent species does the universe hold outside of Earth?\n4. Are any staff members dating?\n5. How many \"state-based conflicts\" are going on right now? (\"state based conflict\" = at least one party is a state, at least 25 deaths a year, massacres and genocides not included)\n6. How much does ESPR (a summer camp) cost?\n7. How many people are members of the Chinese communist party?\n8. What is the US defense budget?\n9. How many daily viewers does Tucker Carlson have?\n\nThe rest of the post is [here](https://nunosempere.com/blog/2022/08/20/fermi-introduction/).

Given a variable of interest, sometimes you can decompose it into steps, and multiplying those steps together gives you a more accurate estimate than estimating the thing you want to know directly. I&amp;#39;ll go through a proof sketch for this at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to take over the world, why should you care about this? Well, you may care about this if you hope that having better models of the world would lead you to make better decisions, and to better achieve your goals. And Fermi estimates are one way of training or showing off the skill of building models of the world. They have fast feedback loops, because you can in many cases then check the answer on the internet afterwards. But they are probably most useful in cases where you can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the class was a trial by fire: I presented some questions, students gave their own estimates, and then briefly discussed them. In case you want to give it a try before seeing the answers, the questions I considered were:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How many people have covid in the UK right now (2022-08-20)?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How many cumulative person years did people live in/under the Soviet Union?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How many intelligent species does the universe hold outside of Earth?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are any staff members dating?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How many &amp;quot;state-based conflicts&amp;quot; are going on right now? (&amp;quot;state based conflict&amp;quot; = at least one party is a state, at least 25 deaths a year, massacres and genocides not included)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How much does ESPR (a summer camp) cost?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How many people are members of the Chinese communist party?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What is the US defense budget?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How many daily viewers does Tucker Carlson have?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the post is &lt;a href=\"https://nunosempere.com/blog/2022/08/20/fermi-introduction/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

the interesting historiography Gottfried did in the previous chapters. But it\u2019s worthwhile as a topic, so here we go.\n\nGottfried starts by explaining the desire in the 1930s by people like Oswald Mosley to create some kind of pan-European unity on the right. They weren\u2019t uniform in their promotion of fascism, but they didn\u2019t see fascism as needing to be done by each country independently. As Gottfried writes it, there was a hope that \u201cThey [fascist countries] could all cooperate in building a new European order and, in the near term, opposing the threat represented by international bolshevism.\u201d\n\nWe now get a lengthy examination of fascist fiction as proof of this hope, starting with the novel *Gilles*, published in 1939 by Pierre Drieu La Rochelle.\n\nAt one point in the novel, the protagonist ends up on a boat with a Pole and an Irishman. When the latter two are asked about why they are fascists, they claim to support the Catholic Church and look to combine \u201cthe ancient with the modern. There\u2019s more debate and discussion about questions like \u201cwhat if the Church doesn\u2019t support fascism or promotes anti-fascism?\u201d and \u201cwhat if Poland tried to ally with the Soviet Union to stop a German invasion?\u201d The answers show that both men are not tied to their countries, but to the promotion of some fascist world order which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean one country rules all. They view rule by democracies as bad as being ruled by the Soviets. The protagonist laments Germany\u2019s \u201cdefective fascism\u201d, hoping it will see the light and vow to honor other European nations\u2019 territory to defeat the Red Menace.\n\nThis protagonist is a reflection of the author\u2019s own views, as one might expect. He\u2019s an admirer of the Frenchman Charles Maurras (who also hated Jews, Americans, and Marxists). He hates France\u2019s Third Republic to the point of supporting the Marxists in their desire to destroy it. He views himself as a supporter of \u201cLatin civilization\u201d over any particular nation, but also doesn\u2019t espouse any particular Catholic dogma.\n\nThere was, however, a tension between this kind of neo-pagan fascist and the clerical fascists. In Austria, conservative Catholics attacked a fascist internationalist journal for supporting neo-pagan doctrines. The journal tried to forestall this by emphasizing Mussolini\u2019s revulsion of Protestantism, and generally tried to tie the Church to fascism (they did, however, highlight the subordination of Catholic beliefs to concepts like Latinity).\n\n###Italian Efforts for International Fascism\n\nGiven that international fascism as depicted thus far draws heavily to supporting Italy, it\u2019s not a surprise that it had widespread support from Italian fascist politicians. Government sponsored groups and publications put forth this idea that fascism had clear international significance. \n\nHistorian Beate Scholz suggests this was all window dressing for consolidating Mussolini\u2019s own rule. As for Gottfried, he says a cynical perspective could conclude that Mussolini supported internationalism up to the moment it was no longer useful. After the invasion of Ethiopia and the alliance with Nazi Germany, he appealed to strict national interest and some racist ideology.\n\nIf we\u2019re willing to be more charitable, Mussolini actually engaged in tremendous support for internationalism. Il Duce himself noted the ties between the Roman Catholic Church and international fascism, for that matter. The Catholics, for their part, viewed the Italians as a political and moral arm of the Counter-Reformation. Asvero Gravelli, one who saw himself as \u201cthe architect of fascist internationalism\u201d, claimed that a giant battle would take place between East and West where the fascists would be the only ones to prevail in the name of Christ and against foreign forces. \n\n###Oswald Mosely\n\nThe biggest worker for the cause of international fascism was not Italian or even a Latin fascist, but apparently an English aristocrat named Oswald Mosely. He was an \u201cauthoritarian modernizer\u201d in the 1920s and 1930s and thoroughly determined to avoid a second European bloodbath. He went through several British political parties before creating his own fascist one.\n\nThe man wasn\u2019t just on the hook of Italy, multiple English aristocrats supported him in one way or another, though he also lost friends over his devotion to the fascist cause. His idea was simple: the Soviet experiment would only harm Britain if tried here, and parliamentary governments could not provide the decisive leadership needed. He courted Nazi Germany but wasn\u2019t so focused on identifying Jews as the enemy in Britain.\n\nOver that last point, he and his wife were claimed to be Nazi agents and imprisoned from 1940 to 1943, despite there being no evidence he ever received Nazi funds. After the war, one of his biographers claims he was highly active in continuing to push for European unity (now described as one nation), but this was not going to work when there was a much more powerful unity in the emerging European Community that was backed by the United States. Also, his programs were being offered by socialists, who weren\u2019t tainted by being on the right.\n\nDespite this picture of a man with tremendous energy, Oswald would die more or less a social outcast in 1980.\n\nIn a way, Mosely\u2019s fate matches that of fascism. He did well in the interwar period but nowhere else, and had his success rooted in Continental Europe. It didn\u2019t happen, of course. The BUF (Mosely\u2019s fascist party) did very poorly in the British elections and thoroughly lost to Labour. And in the post-WW2 era, all fascists carried the association of Nazism. \n\nBut what if they didn\u2019t carry that stigma? Would they have done better? Probably not, their economic programs weren\u2019t different enough from other parties, and their point of difference was a warning about Third World immigration, but that was a lost cause.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of whether fascism could ever be international in nature. Gottfried argues no, as while communism was universal at its core and that universalism was central to how the Bolsheviks built their government in the Soviet Union, fascist governments always saw internationalism as a secondary concern. Indeed, by the time the remaining fascist movements in Europe post-WW2 even got around to pledging to assist each other in making a fascist Europe, it was 1961 and the time had long since passed.\n\nTo summarize this chapter further:\n\n**Fascism had people who were dedicated to making an international export of it, but its movements were primarily focused on their own nations and didn\u2019t care that much about making a fascist international community. After WW2, they fell to the wayside as increasingly irrelevant and unable to escape the association with the Nazis.**\n\nI hope you enjoyed!

For obvious reasons (= I read them already).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Less Wrong. Time-consuming to find the relevant posts from the midst of the &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s snort Orexin&amp;quot; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- NYT, WP, WT, NY, or what have you generic news site. It&amp;#39;s very time-consuming to fish for the relevant matters from all the garbage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- An easy way to be an annoying know-it-all. I know understanding matters takes time. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m trying to be efficient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Someone&amp;#39;s pet theory of the Number One Neglected Issue. In this context, I don&amp;#39;t give a damn about fringe views; they already have a slot in my timetable. Yes I understand some fringe views might be important. In this context, I want solid analysis or facts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Boo Outgroup. I can take a source having a bias, just as long as it&amp;#39;s open about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Learning maths. That&amp;#39;s another matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why am I asking for help: Sometimes finding good sources is hard and requires a lot of time and/or luck. I don&amp;#39;t want to count on my luck, and I think there are a lot of people a lot smarter than I am in this sub. So I&amp;#39;m hoping you might be willing to share some of your sources with which you update on your everyday beliefs on what&amp;#39;s actually going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance - if this post is ill-equipped for this sub, please delete it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "wwmw6v", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Kapselimaito", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wwmw6v/the_most_efficient_way_to_keep_updated_on_likely/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwmw6v/the_most_efficient_way_to_keep_updated_on_likely/", "subreddit_subscribers": 18578, "created_utc": 1661355945.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "selftext": "The Wednesday Wellness threads are meant to encourage users to ask for and provide advice and motivation to improve their lives.
