['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of May 30, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_v0trau", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 38, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 38, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1653891311.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

It's an idea that's popular in populist leftist communities like r/degrowth (obviously), r/collapse, r/sustainability, and r/anticonsumption. You can read more about Degrowth from it's main website [here](https://degrowth.info/degrowth), but the argument for degrowth in its simplest goes like this:\n\np1: Economic output is hurting the environment and creating wealth inequality.\n\np2: We have been increasing economic output for hundreds of years, which has heavily damaged the environment and created gross wealth inequality.\n\nc: Therefore, we should reduce economic output to help reverse the damage of the environment and wealth inequality.\n\nBasically, it's a movement dedicated to protecting the environment and in a sense, \"regressing\" toward an earlier stage of economic growth for developed economies and maintaining that stage of growth instead of attempting to advance the economy. \n\n##My Background:\n\nUsually I write about things from my personal research. I like to think I'm educated in many issues, but most things I write about are still coming from laity. However, here I majored in Environmental Studies and currently teach a high school Economics class, so in this rare case, I happen to be qualified in both discussions. \n\nThe issue that I had with my peers in my college courses was that most of them myopically focused on Environmental preservation as the sole goal or the biggest goal that humanity should be focused on. Obviously I think that environmental preservation is one of the most important things if not the most important thing we should be doing right now. But personally, I took a more holistic approach to environmental activism. I reject the idea that economic growth and environmental preservation are fundamentally at odds. \n\n##How reducing economic growth and output doesn't actually help the environment\n\nGDP growth in a country tends to measure the total economic activity in a country. This includes things like industrial output sure, but this also includes green innovation. Every solar panel installed, every wind turbine set up, and every electric car sold counts for GDP growth. What matters is what percentage of the energy market cap is dominated by green energy. According to the US Energy Information Administration, [renewables accounted for 20% of US energy generation and 12% of energy consumption](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3). This is rapidly growing in share of energy production, and this is reflected in GDP growth.\n\nRenewables are also popular on the market. We can see this with how famously popular and overvalued $TSLA stock was. Because renewable energy is expected to have such tremendous growth, it is a heavy investment attractor. Investment into emerging technologies tends to be much higher during expansionary periods, and renewables are constantly consuming more and more of the energy market cap. Therefore, economic growth actually helps drive renewable innovation.\n\nDuring contractionary periods, investment tends to dry up because people want to hold onto their money. That's why pretty much every company has shrunk in market cap during this time of economic contraction (this article was written in Q2 2022). When economic growth isn't expected, people aren't willing to fund more innovative renewable technology and instead stick to established nonrenewables.\n\nThe term \"degrowth\" is not in the vocabulary of any reputable Environmental Scientist. They instead insist on \"sustainable growth\". \n\n##How reducing GDP per capita doesn't reduce emissions\n\nContrary to popular belief, some of the richest countries in the world per capita GDP also have some of the lowest emissions per capita. [Norway has the 6th highest GDP per capita of $67,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita) yet is in [29th place for emissions per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita). The Scandinavian countries are also among the world leaders in environmental research and are some of the greenest countries in the world. There's many poor 3rd world countries who emit very little, but as they develop they tend to be high emitting countries. so this state of almost no economic development and low CO2 output is not sustainable at all, nor is this idea palpable to the people in these countries.\n\nTo be fair, there's countries like the US who have the 12th highest GDP per capita yet are the 9th biggest emitter of tons of CO2 per capita. The difference between the US and the Scandinavian countries is very obvious though; Scandinavian countries have eco-friendly governments whereas the US government is chronically openly eco-hostile. That's why energy for environmentalists is so much better spent on getting people to vote for eco-friendly political parties.\n\n##How reducing economic growth doesn't stop wealth inequality\n\nOne big argument of the degrowth movement is that growing economies also create larger and larger gaps between the rich and poor. To a degree this is actually true. Both the rich and poor increase in wealth but the rich tend to increase in wealth faster than the poor. When economies grow, new businesses develop, new products are created, and people increase in wealth as their skills are competed for. In high growth markets, there's a high degree of upward social mobility for lower class people. In the US, a lot of the so-called \"death of the middle class\" has more to do with the fact that a lot of previously middle class people are moving upward on the social ladder. \n\nIn a no-growth market, new assets are not being created, and are therefore having a strictly finite amount of wealth being monopolized by the wealthy. As a result, this creates downward mobility for the middle and lower classes. This is why markets in depression have such bad downward mobility issues with almost no social mobility. With lack of work, people are often forced to take pay cuts. This is why in a no-growth economy, the rich get relatively richer even faster and the poor decrease in wealth. In growing economies, both are growing in wealth.\n\n##Conclusion\n\nThe Degrowth movement if successful would not achieve any of it's desired goals. So this raises the question of why it's gained traction online. Its biggest appeal is likely its simplicity.

It&amp;#39;s an idea that&amp;#39;s popular in populist leftist communities like &lt;a href=\"/r/degrowth\"&gt;r/degrowth&lt;/a&gt; (obviously), &lt;a href=\"/r/collapse\"&gt;r/collapse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/r/sustainability\"&gt;r/sustainability&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/r/anticonsumption\"&gt;r/anticonsumption&lt;/a&gt;. You can read more about Degrowth from it&amp;#39;s main website &lt;a href=\"https://degrowth.info/degrowth\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the argument for degrowth in its simplest goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;p1: Economic output is hurting the environment and creating wealth inequality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;p2: We have been increasing economic output for hundreds of years, which has heavily damaged the environment and created gross wealth inequality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;c: Therefore, we should reduce economic output to help reverse the damage of the environment and wealth inequality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, it&amp;#39;s a movement dedicated to protecting the environment and in a sense, &amp;quot;regressing&amp;quot; toward an earlier stage of economic growth for developed economies and maintaining that stage of growth instead of attempting to advance the economy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;My Background:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually I write about things from my personal research. I like to think I&amp;#39;m educated in many issues, but most things I write about are still coming from laity. However, here I majored in Environmental Studies and currently teach a high school Economics class, so in this rare case, I happen to be qualified in both discussions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue that I had with my peers in my college courses was that most of them myopically focused on Environmental preservation as the sole goal or the biggest goal that humanity should be focused on. Obviously I think that environmental preservation is one of the most important things if not the most important thing we should be doing right now. But personally, I took a more holistic approach to environmental activism. I reject the idea that economic growth and environmental preservation are fundamentally at odds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How reducing economic growth and output doesn&amp;#39;t actually help the environment&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GDP growth in a country tends to measure the total economic activity in a country. This includes things like industrial output sure, but this also includes green innovation. Every solar panel installed, every wind turbine set up, and every electric car sold counts for GDP growth. What matters is what percentage of the energy market cap is dominated by green energy. According to the US Energy Information Administration, &lt;a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;amp;t=3\"&gt;renewables accounted for 20% of US energy generation and 12% of energy consumption&lt;/a&gt;. This is rapidly growing in share of energy production, and this is reflected in GDP growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Renewables are also popular on the market. We can see this with how famously popular and overvalued $TSLA stock was. Because renewable energy is expected to have such tremendous growth, it is a heavy investment attractor. Investment into emerging technologies tends to be much higher during expansionary periods, and renewables are constantly consuming more and more of the energy market cap. Therefore, economic growth actually helps drive renewable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During contractionary periods, investment tends to dry up because people want to hold onto their money. That&amp;#39;s why pretty much every company has shrunk in market cap during this time of economic contraction (this article was written in Q2 2022). When economic growth isn&amp;#39;t expected, people aren&amp;#39;t willing to fund more innovative renewable technology and instead stick to established nonrenewables.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;quot;degrowth&amp;quot; is not in the vocabulary of any reputable Environmental Scientist. They instead insist on &amp;quot;sustainable growth&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How reducing GDP per capita doesn&amp;#39;t reduce emissions&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, some of the richest countries in the world per capita GDP also have some of the lowest emissions per capita. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal\"&gt;Norway has the 6th highest GDP per capita of $67,000&lt;/a&gt;_per_capita) yet is in &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita\"&gt;29th place for emissions per capita&lt;/a&gt;. The Scandinavian countries are also among the world leaders in environmental research and are some of the greenest countries in the world. There&amp;#39;s many poor 3rd world countries who emit very little, but as they develop they tend to be high emitting countries. so this state of almost no economic development and low CO2 output is not sustainable at all, nor is this idea palpable to the people in these countries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be fair, there&amp;#39;s countries like the US who have the 12th highest GDP per capita yet are the 9th biggest emitter of tons of CO2 per capita. The difference between the US and the Scandinavian countries is very obvious though; Scandinavian countries have eco-friendly governments whereas the US government is chronically openly eco-hostile. That&amp;#39;s why energy for environmentalists is so much better spent on getting people to vote for eco-friendly political parties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How reducing economic growth doesn&amp;#39;t stop wealth inequality&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One big argument of the degrowth movement is that growing economies also create larger and larger gaps between the rich and poor. To a degree this is actually true. Both the rich and poor increase in wealth but the rich tend to increase in wealth faster than the poor. When economies grow, new businesses develop, new products are created, and people increase in wealth as their skills are competed for. In high growth markets, there&amp;#39;s a high degree of upward social mobility for lower class people. In the US, a lot of the so-called &amp;quot;death of the middle class&amp;quot; has more to do with the fact that a lot of previously middle class people are moving upward on the social ladder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a no-growth market, new assets are not being created, and are therefore having a strictly finite amount of wealth being monopolized by the wealthy. As a result, this creates downward mobility for the middle and lower classes. This is why markets in depression have such bad downward mobility issues with almost no social mobility. With lack of work, people are often forced to take pay cuts. This is why in a no-growth economy, the rich get relatively richer even faster and the poor decrease in wealth. In growing economies, both are growing in wealth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Degrowth movement if successful would not achieve any of it&amp;#39;s desired goals. So this raises the question of why it&amp;#39;s gained traction online. Its biggest appeal is likely its simplicity. The logic is this: Economic output is hurting the environment, therefore we should have less of it. For people who don&amp;#39;t understand economics (which is most of the internet), it seems like a good idea. Degrowth is simply the newest fad for populist leftists on sites like Reddit and Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be fair, degrowth sentiment is not exclusive to the left. Anti-Economic ideologies like Distributivism, Integralism, Neo-Ludditism, and Neo-Merchentilism are conservative ideas that have been along way longer and hold almost as much clout with the Right as Degrowth does with the Left.

They are his group and his helpers in his enterprise. He uses them to fight against those who revolt against his dynasty. It is they with whom he fills the administrative offices, whom he appoints as wazirs and tax collectors. They help him to achieve superiority. They participate in the government. They share in all his other important affairs.\n\n&gt;This applies as long as the first stage of a dynasty lasts, as we have stated. With the approach of the second stage, the ruler shows himself independent of his people, claims all the glory for himself, and pushes his people away from it with the palms (of his hands). \n\n&gt;As a result, his own people become, in fact, his enemies. In order to prevent them from seizing power, and in order to keep them away from participation (in power), the ruler needs other friends, not of his own skin, whom he can use against (his own people) and who will be his friends in their place. These (new friends) become closer to him than anyone else. They deserve better than anyone else to be close to him and to be his followers, as well as to be preferred and to be given high positions, because they are willing to give their lives for him, preventing his own people from regaining the power that had been theirs and from occupying with him the rank to which they had been used.\n\n&gt;In this (situation), the ruler cares only for his new followers. He singles them out for preference and many honors. He distributes among them as much (property) as (he does among) most of his own people. He confers upon them the most important administrative positions, such as the offices of wazir, general, and tax collector, as well as royal titles which are his own prerogative, and which he does not share (even) with his own people. (He does this) because they are now his closest friends and most sincere advisers. This, then, announces the destruction of the dynasty and indicates that chronic disease has befallen it, the result of the loss of the group feeling on which the (dynasty's) superiority had been built. The feelings of the people of the dynasty become diseased as a result of the contempt in which they are held and the hostility the ruler (shows against them). \n\n&gt;They hate him and await the opportunity of a change in his fortune. The great danger inherent in this situation reverts upon the dy\u00adnasty. There can be no hope it will recover from that illness. The (mistakes of the) past grow stronger with each successive generation and lead eventually to loss of the (dynasty's) identity.\n\n&gt;This is exemplified by the Umayyad dynasty. For their wars and for administrative purposes, they had recourse to the support of Arabs such as (*long list of personalities I, /u/Lost_Martian_Expat \n have removed because it fucked up reddit). \n\n&gt;For a while the 'Abbasid dynasty, too, used the support of Arab personalities. But when the dynasty came to claim all the glory for itself and kept the Arabs from aspiring to administrative positions, the wazirate fell to non-Arabs and followers such as the Barmecides, the Banu Sahl b. Nawbakht, and, later, the Buyids, and Turkish clients such as Bughi, Wasif, Utamish, Bakiyik (Bayakbak), Ibn Tulun, and their descendants, among other non-Arab clients. Thus, the dynasty came to belong to people other than those who had established it. The power went to people other than those who had first won it.\n\n&gt;This is how God proceeds with His servants.\n\nPerhaps clunkly inserted on my part, but Scott Alexanders article, [I CAN TOLERATE ANYTHING EXCEPT THE OUTGROUP](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/) also touches upon this topic, I feel.\n\n&gt;So what makes an outgroup?

Please let me know if this isn't the right place to share this.\n\nI believe the mods turned down moving to a service hosted by someone else (which might raise the same problems) and are instead planning on setting up something that the community, or someone with it, itself hosts.  The concept I'm working involves getting rid of the idea that conversations and communication have to be hosted in one place.\n\nThe premise behind ADZE is that instead of people conversing with each other by editing entries in a single database (which necessitates an owner and thus some kind of central control), we can instead communicate with each other by editing publicly accessible documents that refer to each other with hyperlinks. Just a like centralized forum doesn't make you edit the database directly, a decentralized approach can still have a handy web ui to make the process cleaner.  The UI would combine the documents of people you've added in your network. There can also be a registry to find 'members in good standing'  so anyone who joins the motte can instantly take place in conversations just by adding all the peers on the motte registry.  \n\nUsers are identified simply by the URL's where they post their links, comments, responses, and feedback.   A conversation around a  URL would happen as multiple clients update their own publicly shared comments, including links to the original URL. You might think of this as something like 'reverse hyperlinks.'\n\nThe differences between (one database  + frontend) for conversations, and (a bunch of documents defined in terms of a protocol + a frontend) are:\n* anyone can join or leave at will,\n* if someone annoys you, you can ignore all their posts with one interaction; other people can still follow that person's actions, if they like them\n* people who like +1 buttons 'like this', etc., style interaction can add that; people who don't care can ignore it\n* people can experiment with custom ranking algorithms\n\nIf we use this new approach, there's no single central place where control _can_ be be applied.  The motte registry would just be one peer among many; some people would only follow peers there,  some people might block peers from the motte registry others would add different peers.

Please let me know if this isn&amp;#39;t the right place to share this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe the mods turned down moving to a service hosted by someone else (which might raise the same problems) and are instead planning on setting up something that the community, or someone with it, itself hosts.  The concept I&amp;#39;m working involves getting rid of the idea that conversations and communication have to be hosted in one place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The premise behind ADZE is that instead of people conversing with each other by editing entries in a single database (which necessitates an owner and thus some kind of central control), we can instead communicate with each other by editing publicly accessible documents that refer to each other with hyperlinks. Just a like centralized forum doesn&amp;#39;t make you edit the database directly, a decentralized approach can still have a handy web ui to make the process cleaner.  The UI would combine the documents of people you&amp;#39;ve added in your network. There can also be a registry to find &amp;#39;members in good standing&amp;#39;  so anyone who joins the motte can instantly take place in conversations just by adding all the peers on the motte registry.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Users are identified simply by the URL&amp;#39;s where they post their links, comments, responses, and feedback.   A conversation around a  URL would happen as multiple clients update their own publicly shared comments, including links to the original URL. You might think of this as something like &amp;#39;reverse hyperlinks.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The differences between (one database  + frontend) for conversations, and (a bunch of documents defined in terms of a protocol + a frontend) are:\n* anyone can join or leave at will,\n* if someone annoys you, you can ignore all their posts with one interaction; other people can still follow that person&amp;#39;s actions, if they like them\n* people who like +1 buttons &amp;#39;like this&amp;#39;, etc., style interaction can add that; people who don&amp;#39;t care can ignore it\n* people can experiment with custom ranking algorithms&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we use this new approach, there&amp;#39;s no single central place where control &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be be applied.  The motte registry would just be one peer among many; some people would only follow peers there,  some people might block peers from the motte registry others would add different peers.  Spam can be controlled in the same manner; anyone can host a blocklist; people can use or not use those depending upon the values the blocklist embodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.adze.network/how#h.cossenwv14z6\"&gt;Read more about the technical solution here&lt;/a&gt;. \nA &lt;a href=\"https://www.adze.network/try-it\"&gt;demo is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am just now getting it to a point where people can start using it; it doesn&amp;#39;t facilitate anything but link sharing.

['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series.

Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Optimistically, we think that &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/LuQ66\"&gt;engaging with people you disagree with&lt;/a&gt; is worth your time, and &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/hH3VO\"&gt;so is being nice!&lt;/a&gt; Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There&amp;#39;s a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/ur3Fh\"&gt;not who you think it is&lt;/a&gt;. Extremists with opposing positions can &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/FtI4S\"&gt;feed off each other&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting each other&amp;#39;s worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Attempting to &amp;#39;build consensus&amp;#39; or enforce ideological conformity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recruiting for a cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Posting links that could be summarized as &amp;#39;Boo outgroup!&amp;#39; Basically, if your content is &amp;#39;Can you believe what Those People did this week?&amp;#39; then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or &lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man\"&gt;steel-man&lt;/a&gt; the relevant viewpoint.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don&amp;#39;t paraphrase unflatteringly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at &lt;a href=\"/r/TheThread\"&gt;r/TheThread&lt;/a&gt;. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on &amp;#39;report&amp;#39; at the bottom of the post, selecting &amp;#39;this breaks &lt;a href=\"/r/themotte\"&gt;r/themotte&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s rules, or is of interest to the mods&amp;#39; from the pop-up menu and then selecting &amp;#39;Actually a quality contribution&amp;#39; from the sub-menu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locking Your Own Posts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We&amp;#39;ve got a solution for you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium.
