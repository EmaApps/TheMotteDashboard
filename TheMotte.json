['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 01, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wda188", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1659334510.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

So I don&amp;#39;t think the general argument for obligation for net positive works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;alternative is not possible&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;nobody thinks the current set of laws and practices are best that is ever possible, that we are living in the best possible utopia&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will always be some bad things, a perfect govt is not possible&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which would justify giving money for those good things and not the bad things but govt currently does not allow partial taxes, working would require paying the full amount in taxes and there&amp;#39;s no discrimination on where the money will be used. So until such taxing is possible, you ought not work if you can survive without working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Taxing for things people think is good is not possible in practice as people can lie for tax evasion&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There can be jury like trials and maybe some made up of philosophers to determine true intentions for those that do not want to pay tax for certain things. If you believe this won&amp;#39;t work, you have to tell me how to fix the justice system in general since you are rejecting the usefulness of jury/trial process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People can be internally consistent with true intention but be wrong&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So can other people who claims they are in the wrong. Someone or some group of people can think sex would be good for Alice but Alice can have some wrong ideas which leads her to not want sex, this doesn&amp;#39;t then make it permissible to make Alice have sex without her consent. Force should not be applied when it is unresolveable who is in the wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "wggsq6", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "_user_account_", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 21, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wggsq6/why_you_currently_should_not_work_if_you_can/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wggsq6/why_you_currently_should_not_work_if_you_can/", "subreddit_subscribers": 18495, "created_utc": 1659659050.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "selftext": "The Wednesday Wellness threads are meant to encourage users to ask for and provide advice and motivation to improve their lives.

['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of July 25, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_w7h8wa", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658729709.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

I am the bulwark against tyranny. I am a hoot at dinner parties. I am this author\u2019s Tinder bio. I am venerated by the new progressive zeitgeist.\n\nI am the corporeal manifestation of professional burnout.\n\nI am useless. So fucking useless.\n\nThere\u2019s a dull reality to my job, which is that my clients have almost always done the thing they\u2019re accused of doing. And usually the evidence against them is overwhelming \u2014 not even a close call. Yet I am duty-bound to poke, prod, and bluff my way into exaggerating a weakness with the government\u2019s case. This usually doesn\u2019t work.\n\nFor example, one time a client was picked up for his *sixth* drunk-driving incident. He had been prohibited from driving eons ago, but that hadn\u2019t stopped him before. In addition to DUI No. 6, he was charged with fleeing the scene after crashing into another car. The fleeing was ineffectual, if only for the fact that *he literally imprinted his license plate number* onto the other car^(1). I saw the picture of the imprint, with a mirrored alphanumeric sequence perfectly legible on the metal body. Cops found his car billowing thick, black smoke in a parking lot in front of a nearby AutoZone. My client hadn\u2019t gotten far from the scene: He was in the driver\u2019s seat, having already passed out and pissed his pants.\n\nSo yeah, when I meet with clients I shrug a lot and give the \u201cwhat-do-you-want-me-to-do?\u201d look. I try to shift delicately into the gentle social worker persona and talk about damage control, which invariably means telling them that accepting a plea deal is the least bad option. This is one reason why [almost everyone chooses to plead guilty](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/innocence-is-irrelevant/534171/). Ninety-four percent of state cases and 97% of federal cases are resolved by a plea deal, to be exact.\n\nAll this means I inhabit a different role than you may think based on TV shows or the occasional op-ed about the noble role of public defenders. I\u2019m not a special agent who parachutes into the enemy hideout to orchestrate and negotiate an elaborate hostage release; I\u2019m just the widget inspector. I\u2019m there to sit at the assembly line with a checklist on a clipboard and make sure that my client\u2019s rights are not violated too much throughout the process. And we literally used a checklist for DUI cases \u2014 six pages of potential rakes we could only pray a cop stepped on: Yes, yes, you have video of the guy swerving all over the road, his speech is as slurred as mud, and he has a small cargo ship\u2019s worth of empty beer bottles in the back. BUT *was the temperature of the liquid simulator solution utilized as the external standard for the breath sample machine measured by a thermometer which was properly certified by the state at the time*? Hmmm?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t happen often, but occasionally the cops do fuck up. Sometimes they don\u2019t notice the thermometer certification lapsed two days prior, and of course you pounce on that. But this almost never happens, and it also underscores how fungible my own contributions are. Anyone plausibly qualified could replace me and it would not make a difference for the most part.\n\nI\u2019m borderline useless, in other words.\n\nBut there are terrifying exceptions to this rote monotony that forever haunt me. Like the one time I cast a spell in court with eleven magic words.\n\n***\n\nThis happened early, when I was still a baby public defender. My client (different from License Plate Man above) was an illegal immigrant^(2) from Mexico. He was already on probation for one DUI when he was caught driving drunk a second time, seven years after the first. A judge released him from jail provided that his family fork over a small ransom for bail and that he agree to having his whereabouts monitored by an ankle bracelet. He would have to come back to address his probation issues in two weeks.\n\nThe ankle bracelet company sends me an update a few days later. My client had visited their office, informed them that he intended to flee the country because he was scared of jail, then underscored his statement with a flourish by *taking out a knife and cutting off the ankle bracelet* in front of them. In terms of the ratio between effort and impact, this was easily one of the simplest ways he could have irredeemably fucked himself over. But I did not have time to dwell on this. His actions meant I had one less client to worry about, since clearly he had decided to take his chances on the lam rather than in court.\n\nTwo weeks pass and I\u2019m in court. Just a normal day: I review the sign-in sheet to see which defendants, of the cases I had prepped, did me the courtesy of showing up. Our caseloads aren\u2019t always as bad as advertised because many of our clients don\u2019t come to court, for reasons ranging from malicious (they\u2019re reenacting a certain 1993 thriller starring Harrison Ford) to banal (the notice was lost in the mail).\n\nThen I see *his* name \u2014 Bracelet Cutter. I turn and scan the row of benches in the gallery and he\u2019s quietly sitting in the back, apparently oblivious to the shitstorm of his own creation he has walked into.\n\nI motion for him to step out in the hallway and my first question is \u201cWhat the *FUCK* are you doing here?\u201d He looks down, ashamed, and explains he realized that if he had fled, his family would have remained liable for the bond they put up to get him released. \u201cI am here to take responsibility,\u201d he says.\n\nThere was no need for me to pillory him any further. He panicked and fucked up, but that was done. Unfortunately, I was completely ill-prepared to handle his case, as I had reasonably assumed he had successfully peaced out of the country (and out of the justice system\u2019s grasp) by now. We went in front of the judge and I announced that my client was turning himself in to jail so that I could better prepare for his case. We\u2019d be back in court in another two weeks.\n\n***\n\nIn part because of those aforementioned stats on the frequency of guilty pleas, public defenders have garnered a reputation for being trial-averse, for pressuring clients to cop a plea just to keep the machine humming along. I think this reputation is ill-deserved. It\u2019s completely counter to my own experience, at least, as few things are talked about with as much awed respect among one\u2019s public-defender peers as the number of trials you have accumulated. It\u2019s the functional equivalent of an attorney\u2019s XP level.\n\nJury trials are sexy and cool and exciting, even despite the abysmal prospects for acquittal. But the understandable focus on dramatic moments can cause people to lose sight of potentially far more consequential proceedings that lack the luster and allure. Like probation hearings.\n\nI hate probation hearings so much.\n\nThe gravitational center of the criminal justice system is not the judge, but the prosecutor. Prosecutors can summon criminal charges from the aether or dispel them into nothingness, if they so choose. The [Trial Tax](https://www.nacdl.org/Document/TrialPenaltySixthAmendmentRighttoTrialNearExtinct) is real, so if you want to avoid getting resolutely fucked at sentencing, your best bet is to play nice from the start. This is what makes accepting a plea deal so irresistible to so many clients. Judges say they ultimately decide \u2014 sure, whatever \u2014 but in practice, a prosecutor\u2019s offer recommendation is virtually guaranteed to be adopted. Judges are busy, and [the vast majority used to be prosecutors themselves](https://www.cato.org/study/are-disproportionate-number-federal-judges-former-government-advocates). A current prosecutor\u2019s blessing on a deal is generally all the oversight a judge cares to invest. If the deal recommends no jail time, you\u2019ll get no jail time. This is what I told all my clients, and it was always true.\n\nBut there\u2019s a caveat, in that many little- or no-jail deals are paired with a laundry list of legal obligations that are monitored by the courts for many years. In addition to not committing new crimes, the obligations can be as simple as attending a class about how drugs are bad. Courts enforce this scheme by imposing the statutory *maximum* amount of jail time (a year for most misdemeanors), but simultaneously *suspending* nearly all of it. Think of it as setting aside a bucket of jail days that can be doled out as needed if a client didn\u2019t adhere to the agreement.\n\nDoling from the bucket was what the probation calendar was for. Clients who had already pled guilty were summoned back to court because they had fucked up *somehow* and needed to explain themselves to the judge.\n\nDuring these probation hearings, the prosecutor would recite the list of violations and recommend a sanction. My job was to come up with a plausible-sounding justification and make a counteroffer for sanction, and the judge would probably just split it down the middle. Sometimes it\u2019s 30 days of house arrest. Sometimes 90 days of jail. If jail, sometimes clients had a week to turn themselves in. Sometimes the court marshals were summoned to take them to jail immediately. All this in the span of 5-10 minutes per person, one after the other. Assembly line humming.\n\n***\n\nGenerally, we had no way of knowing when someone would be summoned back to court for a probation hearing until it was scheduled. Our paralegals scanned the calendars and dove into our archives to retrieve a client\u2019s file. I tried to call my clients prior to court appearances, but this was often a lost cause as numbers were frequently disconnected, out of service, or linked to full voicemail boxes. The best that you could eventually hope for was for the client to actually show up to court so that you could confer for the requisite five minutes in the adjoining hallways and stairwells before the proceedings.\n\nBut as much as Bracelet Cutter fucked up his prospects in other ways, at least there wasn\u2019t any question as to whether he\u2019d show up for his hearing \u2014 he was in jail, after all. I swung by with an interpreter (his English was passable, but not great) to fill him in on the details and answer his questions. I felt ready for the hearing.\n\nThe day came. Bracelet Cutter\u2019s mother, wife, and children were in attendance in the gallery. The court churned through its list of cases until it was our turn.\n\nRecall how plea deals are structured, and how the entire purpose of a *suspended* jail sentence is to dangle the anvil over someone\u2019s head to \u201cencourage\u201d them to do the things they\u2019re supposed to do. The bargain means you avoid jail time so long as you meet your obligations. But what if, perhaps through your repeated and extended frittering away of your opportunities to stay out of jail, there is no realistic expectation you\u2019ll ever meet your obligations to the court? Rather than continue burning up the court\u2019s resources, judges could instead impose a hefty jail sentence *now* and just close the file. This is affectionately known as \u201cImpose &amp; Close.\u201d\n\nOn this day, luckily, the prosecutor was not feeling particularly bloodthirsty. He was going to recommend the mandatory minimum sanction of 48 hours in jail, which my client had more than already served by now, and leave the rest of the jail time suspended, meaning he wouldn\u2019t have to serve it as long as he behaved himself. I was more than happy to cosign on that recommendation, excited to see the judge rubber-stamp our joint agreement.\n\nDespite the good sign, though, I was still cautious \u2014 I had not walked into the hearing with much confidence. I knew that my client\u2019s decision to cut off an ankle bracelet and threaten to flee to Mexico was going to be on the judge\u2019s mind, and I knew that the worst approach with her would have been to ignore the issue completely. After effusively agreeing with the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, I got ahead of the issue. I started by acknowledging what happened, framing it from the standpoint of a poor guy panicking in a stressful situation, and highlighted the extended meeting I had with him while he was in jail. His family members in the gallery served as helpful props in my argument. After all, *why would he flee the country when* \\*gesturing widely\\* *his family is right here*?\n\nThis did not work. The judge said that she had no confidence that my client would be able to meet his legal obligations. She then turned to the prosecutor and asked what the recommended jail sentence was to close the file out. Which meant Impose &amp; Close was happening.\n\nThis was a full-blown red alert moment, and by far the worst possible outcome. Now that a probation period appeared to be off the table, the prosecutor was no longer tied to asking for just two days in jail. The price to close the file would be 180 days. I stood up and did my best to slide in and emphasize that neither party requested to close out the file, and repeated my spiel.\n\nThe judge politely listened and then imposed 180 days in jail. The reactions came in waves \u2014 my client\u2019s mom yelled out in anguish first because she could understand the judge, and then her son followed after the court interpreter delivered the bad news in Spanish. My client was handcuffed and slumped in his chair, disconsolate. This didn\u2019t just mean six months in jail; ICE kept watch over the local jail rosters, so the sentence was not only long but virtually assured his deportation.\n\nI tried to focus, to ignore the sudden cacophony reverberating around me. I remained standing and stared at nothing in particular. Fifteen seconds passed. *What now?* Was there anything I could do? Was there anything I *should* do?\n\nThirty seconds passed, and the only audible sound was the shuffling of paper and murmurs across the gallery. I figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try, so I strung together a hastily improvised request to the judge \u2014 hereafter known as the Eleven Magic Words:\n\n\u201cIs there anything the court would like to review to reconsider?\u201d\n\nThere are words recognized within legal circles to have near magical properties. The Supreme Court will tell you that all you need to immediately and forcefully end a police interrogation is to [unambiguously ask for a lawyer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/11/02/the-suspect-told-police-give-me-a-lawyer-dog-the-court-says-he-wasnt-asking-for-a-lawyer/). Declarations [etched in steel](https://globalnews.ca/news/926746/dying-sk-farmers-will-goes-down-in-history/) by a dying man have the power to move trillions in assets. Even [the lowly comma](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/us/oxford-comma-maine.html), or the absence thereof, can overturn entire industries. But the eleven words I uttered that day are not valorized or dissected by any scholars. They shoulder no inherent legal significance. And yet, they earned their title for what happened next.\n\nNothing but silence now. The judge peered directly at me over her glasses. She then asked for the file back from the clerk and barely even opened it before announcing, \u201cAll right. Mr. Meskhout, I\u2019ll go ahead and give him an opportunity. *Since you have asked.*\u201d\n\nThe judge then imposed two days in jail. Two days instead of one hundred and eighty.\n\nThe cacophony started up again \u2014 outcries of joy (and some confusion) this time rather than anguish. I gathered that neither my client nor his mom quite understood what the fuck had just happened. I certainly didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201c*Since you have asked.*\u201d\n\nMy heart rate skyrocketed and my eyes twitched. I remained standing and did my best to maintain composure.\n\n\u201c*Since you have asked.*\u201d\n\nI kept replaying that sentence over and over in my head. This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to work. I was not supposed to have this much power. I\u2019m supposed to be useless, remember? A widget inspector. There was something thoroughly unconscionable about what had just transpired. I uttered eleven magic words in the right combination and this man\u2019s life trajectory shifted radically, likely from near-assured deportation to continued freedom in the United States. *I am not supposed to have this much power*.\n\nTo say that I felt fear is an understatement. But I kept all of this to myself. This was my last hearing for the morning and I could go back to my office now and process at my pace.\n\nI hastily scrawled my signature on the court order and walked out of the courtroom. My client was escorted out by the jail guard right behind me. Normally, inmates get their hands and feet shackled together before they step out. My client was completely unshackled. And normally, the jail guards waste no time heading to the security elevator they have exclusive access to, but my client was headed in the opposite direction.\n\nI saw where he was going. His children had been sitting on a bench in the hallway. My client ran forward and bent down to embrace them both, and all I remember him exclaiming was \u201c*\u00a1Ni\u00f1os!*\u201d The jail guard was calmly walking right behind this unfolding security breach beaming and carrying the shackled chain in his hands. My client finished hugging his children then promptly stood up and placed his hands behind his back to be shackled again. The guard and my client continued taking the long way to the security elevator.\n\nI was awestruck by the unexpected display of humanity by the guard. I have no idea when they negotiated this, but he broke all kinds of protocol just to let my client have this brief embrace with his children.\n\nI walked into the main elevators by myself, watched the doors close, and waited for the cab to start moving. Once I knew I was alone and safely insulated by several layers of steel and concrete, I finally let out the primal scream I had been holding in this whole time.\n\nOnce the heart palpitations calmed, I reflected on what transpired. I certainly would *love* to believe it was the Eleven Magic Words that did the trick that day \u2014 that would reflect well on my legal acumen and provide me a modicum of agency within this chaos. But that is a self-serving delusion that would also imbue the criminal justice system with a patina of legitimacy it has no rightful claim on.\n\nIn all likelihood, the judge changed her mind because fuck you \u2014 that\u2019s why. They\u2019re human after all, subject to the same tempestuous emotional storms as the rest of us, including the same impulses that might prompt you to idly fantasize about a horrific vehicular rending of the guy who just cut you off on the road. Despite that human fallibility, they\u2019re nevertheless endowed with a terrific amount of *real* power over other people\u2019s lives. Maybe if they\u2019re addressed as \u201cYour Honor\u201d enough times per minute, they\u2019ll believe it and act accordingly.\n\nOr maybe I should jettison the fake humility and just take credit. Based purely on the sequence of events (I said something, a thing happened), I have a legitimate basis to exploit this story to flatter myself and impress attractive individuals. Yet this too has horrifying implications.\n\nEither way, every day since, I wonder whether I will clock out at the end of the day as the mild-mannered widget inspector I normally am. Every morning I wonder whether that day has Eleven Magic Words and, if it does, whether I\u2019ll be able to figure them out. And every day that potential scares the shit out of me.\n\nAnd yet, I still do the work. I\u2019m still a public defender.\n\n***\n\n^(1) I have told this story to many fellow attorneys, and more than once they\u2019ve had to double-check to make sure I wasn\u2019t talking about their own client, because apparently imprinting your own license plate number on the other car is a relatively common occurrence among the nation\u2019s habitual drunk drivers.\n\n^(2) [Here\u2019s](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/obfuscating-euphemisms-in-the-immigration) why I still use this term.", "author_fullname": "t2_3whc1m0w", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Eleven Magic Words", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_w5jyyd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 186, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 186, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1658595674.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658520321.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Originally published as my&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/eleven-magic-words\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;first contribution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;to Singal-Minded back in February, and now unlocked for everyone.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a public defender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am the vanguard of justice. I am the bulwark against tyranny. I am a hoot at dinner parties. I am this author\u2019s Tinder bio. I am venerated by the new progressive zeitgeist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am the corporeal manifestation of professional burnout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am useless. So fucking useless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a dull reality to my job, which is that my clients have almost always done the thing they\u2019re accused of doing. And usually the evidence against them is overwhelming \u2014 not even a close call. Yet I am duty-bound to poke, prod, and bluff my way into exaggerating a weakness with the government\u2019s case. This usually doesn\u2019t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, one time a client was picked up for his &lt;em&gt;sixth&lt;/em&gt; drunk-driving incident. He had been prohibited from driving eons ago, but that hadn\u2019t stopped him before. In addition to DUI No. 6, he was charged with fleeing the scene after crashing into another car. The fleeing was ineffectual, if only for the fact that &lt;em&gt;he literally imprinted his license plate number&lt;/em&gt; onto the other car&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. I saw the picture of the imprint, with a mirrored alphanumeric sequence perfectly legible on the metal body. Cops found his car billowing thick, black smoke in a parking lot in front of a nearby AutoZone. My client hadn\u2019t gotten far from the scene: He was in the driver\u2019s seat, having already passed out and pissed his pants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, when I meet with clients I shrug a lot and give the \u201cwhat-do-you-want-me-to-do?\u201d look. I try to shift delicately into the gentle social worker persona and talk about damage control, which invariably means telling them that accepting a plea deal is the least bad option. This is one reason why &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/innocence-is-irrelevant/534171/\"&gt;almost everyone chooses to plead guilty&lt;/a&gt;. Ninety-four percent of state cases and 97% of federal cases are resolved by a plea deal, to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All this means I inhabit a different role than you may think based on TV shows or the occasional op-ed about the noble role of public defenders. I\u2019m not a special agent who parachutes into the enemy hideout to orchestrate and negotiate an elaborate hostage release; I\u2019m just the widget inspector. I\u2019m there to sit at the assembly line with a checklist on a clipboard and make sure that my client\u2019s rights are not violated too much throughout the process. And we literally used a checklist for DUI cases \u2014 six pages of potential rakes we could only pray a cop stepped on: Yes, yes, you have video of the guy swerving all over the road, his speech is as slurred as mud, and he has a small cargo ship\u2019s worth of empty beer bottles in the back. BUT &lt;em&gt;was the temperature of the liquid simulator solution utilized as the external standard for the breath sample machine measured by a thermometer which was properly certified by the state at the time&lt;/em&gt;? Hmmm?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t happen often, but occasionally the cops do fuck up. Sometimes they don\u2019t notice the thermometer certification lapsed two days prior, and of course you pounce on that. But this almost never happens, and it also underscores how fungible my own contributions are. Anyone plausibly qualified could replace me and it would not make a difference for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m borderline useless, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are terrifying exceptions to this rote monotony that forever haunt me. Like the one time I cast a spell in court with eleven magic words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happened early, when I was still a baby public defender. My client (different from License Plate Man above) was an illegal immigrant&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from Mexico. He was already on probation for one DUI when he was caught driving drunk a second time, seven years after the first. A judge released him from jail provided that his family fork over a small ransom for bail and that he agree to having his whereabouts monitored by an ankle bracelet. He would have to come back to address his probation issues in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ankle bracelet company sends me an update a few days later. My client had visited their office, informed them that he intended to flee the country because he was scared of jail, then underscored his statement with a flourish by &lt;em&gt;taking out a knife and cutting off the ankle bracelet&lt;/em&gt; in front of them. In terms of the ratio between effort and impact, this was easily one of the simplest ways he could have irredeemably fucked himself over. But I did not have time to dwell on this. His actions meant I had one less client to worry about, since clearly he had decided to take his chances on the lam rather than in court.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two weeks pass and I\u2019m in court. Just a normal day: I review the sign-in sheet to see which defendants, of the cases I had prepped, did me the courtesy of showing up. Our caseloads aren\u2019t always as bad as advertised because many of our clients don\u2019t come to court, for reasons ranging from malicious (they\u2019re reenacting a certain 1993 thriller starring Harrison Ford) to banal (the notice was lost in the mail).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I see &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; name \u2014 Bracelet Cutter. I turn and scan the row of benches in the gallery and he\u2019s quietly sitting in the back, apparently oblivious to the shitstorm of his own creation he has walked into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I motion for him to step out in the hallway and my first question is \u201cWhat the &lt;em&gt;FUCK&lt;/em&gt; are you doing here?\u201d He looks down, ashamed, and explains he realized that if he had fled, his family would have remained liable for the bond they put up to get him released. \u201cI am here to take responsibility,\u201d he says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no need for me to pillory him any further. He panicked and fucked up, but that was done. Unfortunately, I was completely ill-prepared to handle his case, as I had reasonably assumed he had successfully peaced out of the country (and out of the justice system\u2019s grasp) by now. We went in front of the judge and I announced that my client was turning himself in to jail so that I could better prepare for his case. We\u2019d be back in court in another two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In part because of those aforementioned stats on the frequency of guilty pleas, public defenders have garnered a reputation for being trial-averse, for pressuring clients to cop a plea just to keep the machine humming along. I think this reputation is ill-deserved. It\u2019s completely counter to my own experience, at least, as few things are talked about with as much awed respect among one\u2019s public-defender peers as the number of trials you have accumulated. It\u2019s the functional equivalent of an attorney\u2019s XP level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jury trials are sexy and cool and exciting, even despite the abysmal prospects for acquittal. But the understandable focus on dramatic moments can cause people to lose sight of potentially far more consequential proceedings that lack the luster and allure. Like probation hearings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate probation hearings so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gravitational center of the criminal justice system is not the judge, but the prosecutor. Prosecutors can summon criminal charges from the aether or dispel them into nothingness, if they so choose. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.nacdl.org/Document/TrialPenaltySixthAmendmentRighttoTrialNearExtinct\"&gt;Trial Tax&lt;/a&gt; is real, so if you want to avoid getting resolutely fucked at sentencing, your best bet is to play nice from the start. This is what makes accepting a plea deal so irresistible to so many clients. Judges say they ultimately decide \u2014 sure, whatever \u2014 but in practice, a prosecutor\u2019s offer recommendation is virtually guaranteed to be adopted. Judges are busy, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.cato.org/study/are-disproportionate-number-federal-judges-former-government-advocates\"&gt;the vast majority used to be prosecutors themselves&lt;/a&gt;. A current prosecutor\u2019s blessing on a deal is generally all the oversight a judge cares to invest. If the deal recommends no jail time, you\u2019ll get no jail time. This is what I told all my clients, and it was always true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there\u2019s a caveat, in that many little- or no-jail deals are paired with a laundry list of legal obligations that are monitored by the courts for many years. In addition to not committing new crimes, the obligations can be as simple as attending a class about how drugs are bad. Courts enforce this scheme by imposing the statutory &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; amount of jail time (a year for most misdemeanors), but simultaneously &lt;em&gt;suspending&lt;/em&gt; nearly all of it. Think of it as setting aside a bucket of jail days that can be doled out as needed if a client didn\u2019t adhere to the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doling from the bucket was what the probation calendar was for. Clients who had already pled guilty were summoned back to court because they had fucked up &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; and needed to explain themselves to the judge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During these probation hearings, the prosecutor would recite the list of violations and recommend a sanction. My job was to come up with a plausible-sounding justification and make a counteroffer for sanction, and the judge would probably just split it down the middle. Sometimes it\u2019s 30 days of house arrest. Sometimes 90 days of jail. If jail, sometimes clients had a week to turn themselves in. Sometimes the court marshals were summoned to take them to jail immediately. All this in the span of 5-10 minutes per person, one after the other. Assembly line humming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, we had no way of knowing when someone would be summoned back to court for a probation hearing until it was scheduled. Our paralegals scanned the calendars and dove into our archives to retrieve a client\u2019s file. I tried to call my clients prior to court appearances, but this was often a lost cause as numbers were frequently disconnected, out of service, or linked to full voicemail boxes. The best that you could eventually hope for was for the client to actually show up to court so that you could confer for the requisite five minutes in the adjoining hallways and stairwells before the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as much as Bracelet Cutter fucked up his prospects in other ways, at least there wasn\u2019t any question as to whether he\u2019d show up for his hearing \u2014 he was in jail, after all. I swung by with an interpreter (his English was passable, but not great) to fill him in on the details and answer his questions. I felt ready for the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The day came. Bracelet Cutter\u2019s mother, wife, and children were in attendance in the gallery. The court churned through its list of cases until it was our turn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recall how plea deals are structured, and how the entire purpose of a &lt;em&gt;suspended&lt;/em&gt; jail sentence is to dangle the anvil over someone\u2019s head to \u201cencourage\u201d them to do the things they\u2019re supposed to do. The bargain means you avoid jail time so long as you meet your obligations. But what if, perhaps through your repeated and extended frittering away of your opportunities to stay out of jail, there is no realistic expectation you\u2019ll ever meet your obligations to the court? Rather than continue burning up the court\u2019s resources, judges could instead impose a hefty jail sentence &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; and just close the file. This is affectionately known as \u201cImpose &amp;amp; Close.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On this day, luckily, the prosecutor was not feeling particularly bloodthirsty. He was going to recommend the mandatory minimum sanction of 48 hours in jail, which my client had more than already served by now, and leave the rest of the jail time suspended, meaning he wouldn\u2019t have to serve it as long as he behaved himself. I was more than happy to cosign on that recommendation, excited to see the judge rubber-stamp our joint agreement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the good sign, though, I was still cautious \u2014 I had not walked into the hearing with much confidence. I knew that my client\u2019s decision to cut off an ankle bracelet and threaten to flee to Mexico was going to be on the judge\u2019s mind, and I knew that the worst approach with her would have been to ignore the issue completely. After effusively agreeing with the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, I got ahead of the issue. I started by acknowledging what happened, framing it from the standpoint of a poor guy panicking in a stressful situation, and highlighted the extended meeting I had with him while he was in jail. His family members in the gallery served as helpful props in my argument. After all, &lt;em&gt;why would he flee the country when&lt;/em&gt; *gesturing widely* &lt;em&gt;his family is right here&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This did not work. The judge said that she had no confidence that my client would be able to meet his legal obligations. She then turned to the prosecutor and asked what the recommended jail sentence was to close the file out. Which meant Impose &amp;amp; Close was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a full-blown red alert moment, and by far the worst possible outcome. Now that a probation period appeared to be off the table, the prosecutor was no longer tied to asking for just two days in jail. The price to close the file would be 180 days. I stood up and did my best to slide in and emphasize that neither party requested to close out the file, and repeated my spiel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The judge politely listened and then imposed 180 days in jail. The reactions came in waves \u2014 my client\u2019s mom yelled out in anguish first because she could understand the judge, and then her son followed after the court interpreter delivered the bad news in Spanish. My client was handcuffed and slumped in his chair, disconsolate. This didn\u2019t just mean six months in jail; ICE kept watch over the local jail rosters, so the sentence was not only long but virtually assured his deportation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to focus, to ignore the sudden cacophony reverberating around me. I remained standing and stared at nothing in particular. Fifteen seconds passed. &lt;em&gt;What now?&lt;/em&gt; Was there anything I could do? Was there anything I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thirty seconds passed, and the only audible sound was the shuffling of paper and murmurs across the gallery. I figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try, so I strung together a hastily improvised request to the judge \u2014 hereafter known as the Eleven Magic Words:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIs there anything the court would like to review to reconsider?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are words recognized within legal circles to have near magical properties. The Supreme Court will tell you that all you need to immediately and forcefully end a police interrogation is to &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/11/02/the-suspect-told-police-give-me-a-lawyer-dog-the-court-says-he-wasnt-asking-for-a-lawyer/\"&gt;unambiguously ask for a lawyer&lt;/a&gt;. Declarations &lt;a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/926746/dying-sk-farmers-will-goes-down-in-history/\"&gt;etched in steel&lt;/a&gt; by a dying man have the power to move trillions in assets. Even &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/us/oxford-comma-maine.html\"&gt;the lowly comma&lt;/a&gt;, or the absence thereof, can overturn entire industries. But the eleven words I uttered that day are not valorized or dissected by any scholars. They shoulder no inherent legal significance. And yet, they earned their title for what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing but silence now. The judge peered directly at me over her glasses. She then asked for the file back from the clerk and barely even opened it before announcing, \u201cAll right. Mr. Meskhout, I\u2019ll go ahead and give him an opportunity. &lt;em&gt;Since you have asked.&lt;/em&gt;\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The judge then imposed two days in jail. Two days instead of one hundred and eighty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cacophony started up again \u2014 outcries of joy (and some confusion) this time rather than anguish. I gathered that neither my client nor his mom quite understood what the fuck had just happened. I certainly didn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c&lt;em&gt;Since you have asked.&lt;/em&gt;\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart rate skyrocketed and my eyes twitched. I remained standing and did my best to maintain composure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c&lt;em&gt;Since you have asked.&lt;/em&gt;\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept replaying that sentence over and over in my head. This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to work. I was not supposed to have this much power. I\u2019m supposed to be useless, remember? A widget inspector. There was something thoroughly unconscionable about what had just transpired. I uttered eleven magic words in the right combination and this man\u2019s life trajectory shifted radically, likely from near-assured deportation to continued freedom in the United States. &lt;em&gt;I am not supposed to have this much power&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To say that I felt fear is an understatement. But I kept all of this to myself. This was my last hearing for the morning and I could go back to my office now and process at my pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hastily scrawled my signature on the court order and walked out of the courtroom. My client was escorted out by the jail guard right behind me. Normally, inmates get their hands and feet shackled together before they step out. My client was completely unshackled. And normally, the jail guards waste no time heading to the security elevator they have exclusive access to, but my client was headed in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw where he was going. His children had been sitting on a bench in the hallway. My client ran forward and bent down to embrace them both, and all I remember him exclaiming was \u201c&lt;em&gt;\u00a1Ni\u00f1os!&lt;/em&gt;\u201d The jail guard was calmly walking right behind this unfolding security breach beaming and carrying the shackled chain in his hands. My client finished hugging his children then promptly stood up and placed his hands behind his back to be shackled again. The guard and my client continued taking the long way to the security elevator.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was awestruck by the unexpected display of humanity by the guard. I have no idea when they negotiated this, but he broke all kinds of protocol just to let my client have this brief embrace with his children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked into the main elevators by myself, watched the doors close, and waited for the cab to start moving. Once I knew I was alone and safely insulated by several layers of steel and concrete, I finally let out the primal scream I had been holding in this whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the heart palpitations calmed, I reflected on what transpired. I certainly would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to believe it was the Eleven Magic Words that did the trick that day \u2014 that would reflect well on my legal acumen and provide me a modicum of agency within this chaos. But that is a self-serving delusion that would also imbue the criminal justice system with a patina of legitimacy it has no rightful claim on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, the judge changed her mind because fuck you \u2014 that\u2019s why. They\u2019re human after all, subject to the same tempestuous emotional storms as the rest of us, including the same impulses that might prompt you to idly fantasize about a horrific vehicular rending of the guy who just cut you off on the road. Despite that human fallibility, they\u2019re nevertheless endowed with a terrific amount of &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; power over other people\u2019s lives. Maybe if they\u2019re addressed as \u201cYour Honor\u201d enough times per minute, they\u2019ll believe it and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I should jettison the fake humility and just take credit. Based purely on the sequence of events (I said something, a thing happened), I have a legitimate basis to exploit this story to flatter myself and impress attractive individuals. Yet this too has horrifying implications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, every day since, I wonder whether I will clock out at the end of the day as the mild-mannered widget inspector I normally am.

['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of July 18, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_w1s5b7", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 34, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 34, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658124910.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Optimistically, we think that &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/LuQ66\"&gt;engaging with people you disagree with&lt;/a&gt; is worth your time, and &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/hH3VO\"&gt;so is being nice!&lt;/a&gt; Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There&amp;#39;s a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/ur3Fh\"&gt;not who you think it is&lt;/a&gt;. Extremists with opposing positions can &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/FtI4S\"&gt;feed off each other&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting each other&amp;#39;s worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Attempting to &amp;#39;build consensus&amp;#39; or enforce ideological conformity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recruiting for a cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Posting links that could be summarized as &amp;#39;Boo outgroup!&amp;#39; Basically, if your content is &amp;#39;Can you believe what Those People did this week?&amp;#39; then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or &lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man\"&gt;steel-man&lt;/a&gt; the relevant viewpoint.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don&amp;#39;t paraphrase unflatteringly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at &lt;a href=\"/r/TheThread\"&gt;r/TheThread&lt;/a&gt;. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on &amp;#39;report&amp;#39; at the bottom of the post, selecting &amp;#39;this breaks &lt;a href=\"/r/themotte\"&gt;r/themotte&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s rules, or is of interest to the mods&amp;#39; from the pop-up menu and then selecting &amp;#39;Actually a quality contribution&amp;#39; from the sub-menu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locking Your Own Posts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We&amp;#39;ve got a solution for you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they&amp;#39;re long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For each post &lt;em&gt;except the last one&lt;/em&gt;, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase &lt;code&gt;automod_multipart_lockme&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can then edit it to remove that phrase and it&amp;#39;ll stay locked.
