This argument casts all challenges to \u201clegitimate\u201d authority as left-wing in nature. A good example is *The Left: From de Sade and Marx to Hitler and Marcus* by Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn.\n\nFrench political theorist Bertrand de Jouvenel describes it as such:\n\n&gt; The history of the democratic doctrine furnishes a striking example of the intellectual system blown about by the social wind. Conceived as the foundation of liberty, modern democracy paves the way for tyranny. Born for the purpose of standing as a bulwark against Power, it ends by providing Power with the finest soil it has ever had in which to spread itself over the social field.\n\nThusly, fascism is not some aberration, but just another possibility of democratic government. Jouvenel goes one step further and argue that not even counter-weights built into the system can prevent this from happening. People who claim to speak for the masses will view them as impediments to achieving their goals. Whether the system then falls to fascism or Marxism is irrelevant, both are departures from some notion of government in which power is limited along class and traditional lines. Tyranny is inevitable in a democracy\u2019s destiny.\n\nKuehnelt-Leddihn offers a similar view, couched in an odd argument. For him, predemocratic Western societies were guided first and foremost by the principle of liberty. Not everyone got it, but power was too distributed for centralized governance. His works have detailed the steps taken by those centralized powers to suppress local power and liberty, both political or religious in nature. For him, the Jacobins were the culmination of two tendencies: \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d and the propensity for destroying social differences, both of which were present in the French Revolution.\n\nThese criticisms (of which there are more detailed in the book, but they aren\u2019t that different) won\u2019t exactly going to find much of a home in modern Western societies, Gottfried concedes. The writers of these arguments have larger grievances with modernity and this fits into their broader goal nicely. But he argues that their arguments typically fail to notice that what counts as \u201cdemocracy\u201d has changed radically over the last 200 years. Today\u2019s democracies are much more likely to emphasize multiculturalism, large welfare states, and loud proclamations of equality and universalism.\n\n####Other Conservative Arguments\n\nClassical conservatives are not the only people to make the case for fascism as a left-wing movement. Historian James Gregor has done quite a bit of work on this as well. What makes his argument different is the focus on the Third World, whose dictatorships Gregor claims are continuing the fascist legacy of Mussolini. He cites in favor of his argument the way in which these dictators invoke calls for national unity to struggle against plutocratic and rich societies. These words, he argues, could easily be fascist rhetoric just as easily as they have been claimed to be communist rhetoric. If anything, fascist concepts are more adaptable, since the resulting society doesn\u2019t make any claims of equality.\n\nGottfried offers some questions in response.\n\n1.\tHow much of this claimed borrowing actually changed the people who borrowed it?\n\n2.\tWhy should we assume these dictators are actually engaging in \u201cradical\u201d/fascist politics and not just taking words and ideas to adorn their nations?\n\n3.\tIn what sense would \u201cradical politics\u201d make a better description of fascist Italy, which retained mostly the same economic structures after the fascists took power, than post-WW2 England, which engaged in radical economic overhaul?\n\nHe casts Gregor\u2019s argument as failing to understand the interwar European right, which valued collectivism and organicism more than individualism, as well as failing to recognize that fascists came to power as a counterrevolutionary force against the revolutionary left.\n\nAnother name comes back, that of Stanley Payne. Payne differentiates between the traditional right (more conservative and moderate than the fascists), the radical right (less willing to support cross-cultural mass mobilization), and the fascists.\n\n####Anti-New Deal Critics\n\nAn important development in America during the 1930s as the fascists were coming to power was the New Deal, a set of programs created by the government to help the country recover from the Great Depression. At the same time, there was notable approval of Italian fascism by American socialists. For example, Cole Porter\u2019s musical \u201cAnything Goes\u201d referred to Mussolini as the \u201ctop,\u201d *The New Republic* had tips for learning from Italy, and people like Horace Kallen and George Soule (both socialist reformers) recommended the fascists idea of autarchy.\n\nCritics of the New Deal thus also criticized fascism. John Flynn decried the way in which the Italian model appeared moderate but wasn\u2019t. In his description, one could support the idea of a planned economy without being considered \u201cradical\u201d if they did so in praise of Italy. Flynn, Hayek, and other libertarians in America placed heavy emphasis on a minimal government during this time, indicating their model of the world was not about right or left, but collectivism vs. individualism. It wasn\u2019t until the 50s that this idea of \u201clibertarian = right\u201d became widespread at the hands of William Buckley Jr. and Russel Kirk.\n\n####Other Conservative Arguments, pt. 2\n\nThe book dives into a lengthy note about in-memory conservative arguments about fascism, and the most notable is that of Jonah Goldberg\u2019s attempt at putting it in the leftist camp with his book *Liberal Fascism*.\n\nGottfried commends, first and foremost, the diligence on display. Goldberg apparently consulted many pieces of literature on what the fascists and Nazis preached and sometimes practiced, then consulted what at-the-time Democrats were saying and traced that to modern leading Democrat politicians. \nThat said, Gottfried notes the somewhat obvious purpose given the \u201cmultiple references to the Clintons.\u201d Goldberg has to engage in some impressive stretching to tie, for example, Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cnew village\u201d to Hilter\u2019s Volksgemeinschaft. There\u2019s a clear difference, given that Hitler would also have been trying to exterminate undesirables.\n\nThen there\u2019s the hilarious fact that Goldberg once condemned Rand Paul for criticizing the Civil Rights Act as right-wing extremism. Gottfried points to the general hypocrisy of Goldberg for claiming to want minimal state intervention but also accepts just about all major violations of that rule as soon as it\u2019s bipartisan.\n\nIn general, Gottfried notes, modern conservative arguments about fascism (typically in detailing their enemies) are very sloppy in use. All things are described as fascist, whether that\u2019s Islam (see: Islamofascism Awareness Week), Putin\u2019s Russia, and more. Some of these people are not terminally interested in describing fascism as a left-wing movement but seeking to justify their own political shifts, but then you have people like William Gairdner who describes the left as microfascists who want to promote reality as malleable. Gottfried concludes with an apt note:\n\n&gt; This verbal looseness makes one suspect that \u201cconservative\u201d journalists are retaliating against those who pummel them with the \u201cf word\u201d\u2026 Such quarreling illustrates what intellectual historian Panajotis Kondylis has styled a \u201cMachtfrage\u201d (question of power), a struggle over the right to define meaning as a way of advancing a partisan cause. This is yet one more example of how the study of fascism has been turned into a political football, a habit that unfortunately is no longer confined to the European anti-fascist Left. By now it may be pandemic.\n\nThis concludes Chapter 4. To summarize Gottfried\u2019s arguments further:\n\n**Classical Conservatives have defined fascism as a left-wing movement based on how it rejected traditional hierarchies in favor of centralizing power in the state\u2019s hands, delineating between collectivist regimes and individualist regimes. Other conservative arguments reflect a sloppiness in using the term by not connecting it to the interwar movements sufficiently, possibly in response to how fascism is a deliberately sloppily-defined weapon used by the left against anything they don\u2019t like.**\n\nNext time, we\u2019ll look at Chapter 5 \u2013 The Failure of Fascist Internationalism.

This argument casts all challenges to \u201clegitimate\u201d authority as left-wing in nature. A good example is &lt;em&gt;The Left: From de Sade and Marx to Hitler and Marcus&lt;/em&gt; by Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;French political theorist Bertrand de Jouvenel describes it as such:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The history of the democratic doctrine furnishes a striking example of the intellectual system blown about by the social wind. Conceived as the foundation of liberty, modern democracy paves the way for tyranny. Born for the purpose of standing as a bulwark against Power, it ends by providing Power with the finest soil it has ever had in which to spread itself over the social field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thusly, fascism is not some aberration, but just another possibility of democratic government. Jouvenel goes one step further and argue that not even counter-weights built into the system can prevent this from happening. People who claim to speak for the masses will view them as impediments to achieving their goals. Whether the system then falls to fascism or Marxism is irrelevant, both are departures from some notion of government in which power is limited along class and traditional lines. Tyranny is inevitable in a democracy\u2019s destiny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kuehnelt-Leddihn offers a similar view, couched in an odd argument. For him, predemocratic Western societies were guided first and foremost by the principle of liberty. Not everyone got it, but power was too distributed for centralized governance. His works have detailed the steps taken by those centralized powers to suppress local power and liberty, both political or religious in nature. For him, the Jacobins were the culmination of two tendencies: \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d and the propensity for destroying social differences, both of which were present in the French Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These criticisms (of which there are more detailed in the book, but they aren\u2019t that different) won\u2019t exactly going to find much of a home in modern Western societies, Gottfried concedes. The writers of these arguments have larger grievances with modernity and this fits into their broader goal nicely. But he argues that their arguments typically fail to notice that what counts as \u201cdemocracy\u201d has changed radically over the last 200 years. Today\u2019s democracies are much more likely to emphasize multiculturalism, large welfare states, and loud proclamations of equality and universalism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Other Conservative Arguments&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Classical conservatives are not the only people to make the case for fascism as a left-wing movement. Historian James Gregor has done quite a bit of work on this as well. What makes his argument different is the focus on the Third World, whose dictatorships Gregor claims are continuing the fascist legacy of Mussolini. He cites in favor of his argument the way in which these dictators invoke calls for national unity to struggle against plutocratic and rich societies. These words, he argues, could easily be fascist rhetoric just as easily as they have been claimed to be communist rhetoric. If anything, fascist concepts are more adaptable, since the resulting society doesn\u2019t make any claims of equality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried offers some questions in response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much of this claimed borrowing actually changed the people who borrowed it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why should we assume these dictators are actually engaging in \u201cradical\u201d/fascist politics and not just taking words and ideas to adorn their nations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what sense would \u201cradical politics\u201d make a better description of fascist Italy, which retained mostly the same economic structures after the fascists took power, than post-WW2 England, which engaged in radical economic overhaul?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He casts Gregor\u2019s argument as failing to understand the interwar European right, which valued collectivism and organicism more than individualism, as well as failing to recognize that fascists came to power as a counterrevolutionary force against the revolutionary left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another name comes back, that of Stanley Payne.

['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of July 11, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_vwbj4s", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 41, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1657520108.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

In any case, the legacy of the Frankfurt School is why Gottfried speaks more directly about them now.\n\nThe story of the Frankfurt School and their relationship with fascism\u2019s changing meaning in the 20th century starts in the 1930s once the Nazis shut down the German institution and forced its mostly Jewish intellectuals to other countries. They eventually settled in New York and began investigating the \u201cpsychic origins of fascism\u201d in the hopes of finding a cure for the madness that infected their fellow Germans.\n\nThe result of their efforts was a seminal work titled *The Authoritarian Society*, published in 1950. This was actually a collection of recycled essays that dealt with anti-Semitism\u2019s social/psychic causes. Theodore Adorno\u2019s famous work *The Authoritarian Personality* (*TAP*) was a part of this, Max Horkheimer (a prominent FS theorist) assigned that part to Adorno.\n\nThe argument was simple; just because Germany had been beaten did not mean the fascist threat was over. No, the real danger was in the victorious Western nations which were slowly moving away from socialism. The American population, in decrying modernist art and being anticommunist, was entranced by \u201cfolk ideas that are even more distant from the life of the people than the most esoteric products of expressionism and surrealism,\u201d Adorno argued at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Herbert Marcuse, another famous FS intellectual, proclaimed in 1947 that the two powers of America and the USSR were both unacceptable to any revolutionary. One was, well, Soviet, and the other in danger of becoming fascist as a byproduct of failing to move from capitalism to socialism. The solution was to resist both.\n\nBut why all this proclaiming about the inevitable fascism in the West? Gottfried describes the motivations of the FS school as follows:\n\n&gt; \u2026some members of the Frankfurt School, most famously Theodor Adorno (1903\u20131969), Herbert Marcuse (1898\u20131979), and Erich Fromm (1900\u20131980), imagined that there could be a future in which sexual fantasies and social needs were both satisfied. This erotically and materially satisfying world could only be achieved, however, by putting an end to advanced capitalism. According to the Frankfurt School, this \u201cirrational\u201d economy perpetuated unfair human inequalities and forced its victims to repress and pervert their natural desires in order to survive in a system of domination over which they had no control.\n\nThe idea of *TAP* was used to explain a lot, in many cases using interviews and surveys to hide the ideological agenda. Some examples:\n\n1.\tBourgeois society made men feel a crisis, which was expressed as anger towards the lower classes, causing social and mental deterioration resulting in patriarchal families.\n\n2.\tWomen who felt hysteria and/or men with antisocial traits were exhibiting \u201cfascist predispositions,\u201d according to Maria Herz Levinson.\n\n3.\tApolitical-seeming students in Germany were actually showing a right-wing mindset, according to Jurgen Habermas.\n\n4.\tAdorno accused a parole officer of being a pseudoconservative on the basis that they didn\u2019t support the New Deal.\n\n5.\tThe California Test was used to place test takers on the F-scale (F meaning fascism). Adorno, one of the creators, claimed it could scientifically determine susceptibility to right-wing authoritarian ideas.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, Gottfried argues, is that American elites did not have these ideas forced upon them. By and large, these theories were adopted with little resistance and had more support than one imagines. \n\nFor example, I think it\u2019s somewhat notable that several members worked with the OSS (the CIA\u2019s predecessor) to work on the aforementioned cure for Germany\u2019s aggressive and fascist political culture. *The Authoritarian Society* was financed and published by the American Jewish Committee. The AJC was no friend of Stalin, being populated by Truman Democrats, according to Gottfried, but they lavished praise upon *TAP*. Historian Christopher Lasch has argued that the people who supported it were too well-educated in research techniques to miss the forced argumentation within.\n\n###The Most Anti-fascist Country And Proud Of It\n\nThe place most impacted by the Frankfurt School\u2019s ideas is, unsurprisingly, Germany. Germany post-WW2 was a divided state that was owned by the Western Allies, meaning it could not really resist the attempts at changing its culture.\n\nThe Western Allies were, naturally, not going to let Nazism rise again. Identifying the Nazis and collaborators was only the first step, the next was to ensure no media ever spread if it was suspected the creators had anti-communist or nationalist sympathies. In Gottfried\u2019s own words, the Nuremberg Trials are \u201cpublic lessons about the evils of the recent German past...staged to advance public reeducation inside and outside of Germany.\u201d\n\nAs time went on, the exiled intellectuals came back to Germany once more. Their base of operations was the university system, in particular sociology departments that the occupation\u2019s government favored in re-education efforts, but also in journalism and the arts. These intellectuals and their disciples were hard at work creating a new consciousness.\n\nThe result? By the 1960s, the critical theorists had anti-fascist followers in the public administration, and even the provincial government of Hessen (ruled by the right-leaning Christian Democrats) allowed these intellectuals to rewrite their primary and secondary school curricula. By the 1970s, the university sociology departments were \u201csaturated with exponents of critical theory\u201d to the point where there was a major tension between orthodox Marxists and Adorno\u2019s disciples. If they agreed on anything, it was in hating \u201cAmerican capitalist imperialism\u201d.\n\nNote: The above is definitive proof that r/stupidpol existed long before the Internet\u2019s creation.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only intra-Marxist difference, of course. Gottfried differentiates between first-generation theorists and second-generation:\n\n&gt; Despite their radicalism, members of the first generation could write knowledgeably and often appreciatively about Goethe, Beethoven, Hegel, and other German luminaries. Their attitude toward the German past was rarely as negative as that of their disciples\u2026Unlike many of their apostles who were preoccupied with proving or asserting collective German culpability, the first generation of critical theorists were mostly willing to let this hobbyhorse drop once they came back to Germany. Their antifascism was more systematically grounded and in some ways less personal than the antifascism of those who came after them.\n\nGottfried describes Habermas as a partisan first and foremost. History, for Habermas, was a tool to reshape Germany, its accuracy is a secondary concern at best. This went as far as lambasting Nolte for placing the Nazis in any broader European context. Habermas also arranged discussion that was \u201cnonhegemonic\u201d in nature, claiming that all would be allowed to speak equally, and the best argument should win. It turned out the exact opposite, with one commentator saying that you could only get into those discussions if you already had the right opinion.\n\n###Neofascism vs. Neo-Marxism, A Sick Idea For A Matrix Fanfic\n\nBy the 1960s, orthodox fascism was dead, and orthodox Marxism had a large competitor in the newer theories of the FS and whatnot. It is the latter group that Gottfried takes time to describe in further detail.\n\nGottfried\u2019s neo-Marxists are entirely without positive traits. He cites Michael Kelpanides, a Greek sociologist, who proclaimed that \u201c[German] neo-Marxists have distinguished themselves mostly by academic snobbery and their resistance to empirical research.\u201d These people defended the East German government even as it was collapsing. These people self-describe as Marxist, but this is code for \u201canti-fascist\u201d, with their stance being moral rather than based on research or some kind of economic world view. They care more about resisting authoritarian social patterns than promoting Marx.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t create academic papers, but Gottfried describes it as a labyrinth for only the initiated to navigate.\n\n&gt; the neo-Marxists expend considerable\u2026grinding out convoluted studies, usually for each other, about the contradictions of capitalism, the immiseration of the working class, and the false consciousness of their opponents. The capitalist foe is often linked to a frozen picture of the market system, one that may have existed when Marx wrote Das Kapital in the 1850s but that now looks outdated. Sometimes the neo-Marxist critics address a global economy, but this complication is described in terms of corporate capitalists who are laboring to hold off an international workers\u2019 revolution. The studies criticized by Kelpanides do not typically draw on a wide data base, and the factual proofs offered come from those who reside in the same academic hothouse.\n\nGottfried goes further than Kelpanides in tracing the origins of this ideology. The latter tracks it to the 1960s, but the former says this is the effect of post-WW2 reeducation efforts. Well-funded sociology departments, as mentioned earlier, were part of a serious Allied effort to prevent Nazism, and this outcome was recommended by advisors to the Allies. Unique, then, to the German neo-Marxists, is a strong focus on fighting authoritarianism or some omni-present fascist threat. Other movements don\u2019t lack these ideas, rather the focus is elsewhere.\n\nAntinationalism was a prominent feature as well, and this was based on a broader desire to condemn the entirety of German history. That history, the argument went, culminated in fascism and neofascism, so it had to be discredited entirely if the threats were to be defeated. In more modern times, this has become, Gottfried explains, a rejection of any idea of Western or European identity politics.\n\nNone of this is to say that extreme nationalist parties didn\u2019t exist in Europe. Gottfried points to the Hungarian Jobbik party which scolded Jews for their disproportionate membership in the Communist Party, as well as the Greater Romania Party which \u201cdoes not shun comparisons with the Iron Guard.\u201d But, he argues, these parties are much tamer and of much smaller power than the Nazis or fascists ever were. Other parties in Europe, like the German NDP or French National Front, are much further from the Nazis or fascists than the Hungarians or Romanians.\n\n###Totalitarianism? What\u2019s That?\n\nThe effect of all this ideological work by the leftists in question, Gottfried argues, has led to the struggle changing from fighting totalitarianism to fighting right-wing extremism. The reasons are three-fold.\n\nFirst, the large communist movements in France and Italy were absorbed into left-wing democratic parties, and their demonologies were adopted as well.\n\nSecondly, what he calls an \u201cinevitable identification [of totalitarianism] with American power during the Cold War.\u201d Anti-Americanism has a long history in Europe, appealing to the traditional right long before it was a staple for the far left. For example, Carl Schmitt spoke strongly about the imperialist nature of America\u2019s desire to spread democracy throughout the world. The effect was to create skepticism around the concept of totalitarianism, which was seen as justifying America\u2019s military presence in Europe. \n\nThirdly, German intellectuals like Habermas didn\u2019t want anything to interfere with the goal of isolating German history as a unique fountain of evil and repression. In 1967, for instance, a work by German psychologists Alexander and Margarete Mitscherlich declared a collective German mental disorder (a running theme with the Frankfurt School was apparently declaring opposition to their ideas as equivalent to a mental disorder). They were determined to see Germans confront their wrongdoing and atone for a uniquely German sin, to the point that Alexander would apparently get very angry if anyone mentioned that millions of ethnic Germans were forced to leave eastern Europe.\n\nOne smaller reason also has to do with the post-1960s declaration that Nazi anti-Semitism had its roots in Christianity, going so far as to claim that Christianity was responsible for the Holocaust.\nIn any case, the effect this has all had in the modern day is obvious, with accusations flying that those who oppose immigration from the Third World or those who ask about the race-IQ connection or those who complain about crime are all fascist. The term is stretched wider and wider until it might as well be a hot-air balloon in size.\n\nTo summarize Gottfried\u2019s arguments further:\n\n**The Frankfurt School has had profound influence over how people see fascism and its connections to various ideas and histories. The intellectuals in the Frankfurt School were politically motivated to pathologize fascism and anything else they thought stood in the way of their liberated utopia. This effect is most pronounced in Germany, which was radically reshaped by Allied efforts to prevent any German Nazi movement from ever reoccurring and the subsequent conquering of universities, journalism, and the arts by the Frankfurt School to turn them into vessels for pushing the agenda of Adorno and his peers. The neo-Marxists are not interested in intellectually honest research or academic work, they act primarily from a moral stance that has little to do with Marx and more to do with fighting anything seen as right-wing or authoritarianism. In more modern times, this has resulted in a reorientation from fighting totalitarianism to fighting perceived right-wing extremism.**\n\nNext time, we\u2019ll go over Chapter 4 \u2013 Fascism as a Movement of the Left.\n\nI hope you enjoyed!", "author_fullname": "t2_crpze", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Let\u2019s Interview Fascism with Paul Gottfried, pt. 3 \u2013 Fascism as the Unconquered Past", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theschism", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_vrc0pq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1656954102.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.theschism", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/theschism/comments/vlalpk/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt1/\"&gt;Part 1 \u2013 Defining Fascism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/theschism/comments/vnn0yx/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_2/\"&gt;Part 2 \u2013 Fascism and Totalitarianism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Can\u2019t Avoid The Frankfurt Folk&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the boys of the Institute for Social Research get a lengthy section of this book dedicated to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those who don\u2019t know, the Institute of Social Research is the home of the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School\"&gt;Frankfurt School&lt;/a&gt; (FS), the collection of works and authors who pioneered the idea of Critical Theory and are integral to any discussion of Cultural Marxism, whether you believe it\u2019s all a right-wing conspiracy or you think these people are proof Joseph McCarthy should have started with academics at the top of his lists. In any case, the legacy of the Frankfurt School is why Gottfried speaks more directly about them now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The story of the Frankfurt School and their relationship with fascism\u2019s changing meaning in the 20th century starts in the 1930s once the Nazis shut down the German institution and forced its mostly Jewish intellectuals to other countries. They eventually settled in New York and began investigating the \u201cpsychic origins of fascism\u201d in the hopes of finding a cure for the madness that infected their fellow Germans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result of their efforts was a seminal work titled &lt;em&gt;The Authoritarian Society&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1950. This was actually a collection of recycled essays that dealt with anti-Semitism\u2019s social/psychic causes. Theodore Adorno\u2019s famous work &lt;em&gt;The Authoritarian Personality&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;TAP&lt;/em&gt;) was a part of this, Max Horkheimer (a prominent FS theorist) assigned that part to Adorno.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The argument was simple; just because Germany had been beaten did not mean the fascist threat was over. No, the real danger was in the victorious Western nations which were slowly moving away from socialism. The American population, in decrying modernist art and being anticommunist, was entranced by \u201cfolk ideas that are even more distant from the life of the people than the most esoteric products of expressionism and surrealism,\u201d Adorno argued at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Herbert Marcuse, another famous FS intellectual, proclaimed in 1947 that the two powers of America and the USSR were both unacceptable to any revolutionary. One was, well, Soviet, and the other in danger of becoming fascist as a byproduct of failing to move from capitalism to socialism. The solution was to resist both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why all this proclaiming about the inevitable fascism in the West? Gottfried describes the motivations of the FS school as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u2026some members of the Frankfurt School, most famously Theodor Adorno (1903\u20131969), Herbert Marcuse (1898\u20131979), and Erich Fromm (1900\u20131980), imagined that there could be a future in which sexual fantasies and social needs were both satisfied. This erotically and materially satisfying world could only be achieved, however, by putting an end to advanced capitalism. According to the Frankfurt School, this \u201cirrational\u201d economy perpetuated unfair human inequalities and forced its victims to repress and pervert their natural desires in order to survive in a system of domination over which they had no control.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of &lt;em&gt;TAP&lt;/em&gt; was used to explain a lot, in many cases using interviews and surveys to hide the ideological agenda. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bourgeois society made men feel a crisis, which was expressed as anger towards the lower classes, causing social and mental deterioration resulting in patriarchal families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who felt hysteria and/or men with antisocial traits were exhibiting \u201cfascist predispositions,\u201d according to Maria Herz Levinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apolitical-seeming students in Germany were actually showing a right-wing mindset, according to Jurgen Habermas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adorno accused a parole officer of being a pseudoconservative on the basis that they didn\u2019t support the New Deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Test was used to place test takers on the F-scale (F meaning fascism). Adorno, one of the creators, claimed it could scientifically determine susceptibility to right-wing authoritarian ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s worse, Gottfried argues, is that American elites did not have these ideas forced upon them. By and large, these theories were adopted with little resistance and had more support than one imagines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, I think it\u2019s somewhat notable that several members worked with the OSS (the CIA\u2019s predecessor) to work on the aforementioned cure for Germany\u2019s aggressive and fascist political culture. &lt;em&gt;The Authoritarian Society&lt;/em&gt; was financed and published by the American Jewish Committee. The AJC was no friend of Stalin, being populated by Truman Democrats, according to Gottfried, but they lavished praise upon &lt;em&gt;TAP&lt;/em&gt;. Historian Christopher Lasch has argued that the people who supported it were too well-educated in research techniques to miss the forced argumentation within.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Most Anti-fascist Country And Proud Of It&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The place most impacted by the Frankfurt School\u2019s ideas is, unsurprisingly, Germany.

In more modern times, this has resulted in a reorientation from fighting totalitarianism to fighting perceived right-wing extremism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time, we\u2019ll go over Chapter 4 \u2013 Fascism as a Movement of the Left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_3e75p", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "vrc0pq", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DrManhattan16", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/theschism/comments/vrc0pq/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_3/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/theschism/comments/vrc0pq/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_3/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2510, "created_utc": 1656954102.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}], "created": 1656954131.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.theschism", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/theschism/comments/vrc0pq/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_3/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "vrc134", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DrManhattan16", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "crosspost_parent": "t3_vrc0pq", "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/vrc134/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_3/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "/r/theschism/comments/vrc0pq/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_3/", "subreddit_subscribers": 18382, "created_utc": 1656954131.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "selftext": "This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts.

Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of July 04, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_vr0t4v", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1656915310.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

As the studies of fascism and what it means are wide and varied by the beliefs of the people who do them, we cannot understand those criticisms without the context of who makes them. The reason he focuses on totalitarianism is his belief that it has the farthest reach.\n\nTotalitarianism is something closely related to the work of Hannah Arendt, a famous 20th-century political philosopher. This view of fascism places a heavy distance between Nazy Germany and the Italian Fascist state. More importantly, it qualitatively equates Stalin\u2019s USSR with that of the Nazis.\n\nTotalitarianism as defined by Arendt and Hans Buchheim is radically antitraditional and antiliberal. For Arendt, the ascendancy of this ideology presupposed \u201cthe breakdown of the class system\u201d.\n\n&gt; \u2026the fall of protecting class walls transformed the slumbering majorities behind all parties into one great unorganized, structureless mass of furious individuals who had nothing in common except their vague apprehension that the hopes of party members were doomed, that the most respected, articulate, and representative members of the community were fools and that all powers that be were not so much evil as they were equally stupid and fraudulent.\n\nOthers like Friedrich and Brzezinski pointed to modern technology, political chaos, and no firm constitutional tradition as important details for making the governments of Hitler and Stalin. These regimes created ideologies that encompassed all of human life with the goal of a future golden age.\n \nThe methods of cementing control were parties, dictators surrounded with true believers, and secret police who smashed dissenters or whatever minorities were the arbitrary enemies. These \u201cenemies\u201d were coincidentally against whatever transformative projects the state had in mind. To this end, these regimes controlled all mass communication and strove to manipulate reality for political ends. There was also a need to be aggressively expansionist. Lastly, the economy was subordinated to state servants, making the dictator total master of all economic relations.\n\nThis was not a welcome definition at the time, the pro-Soviet left and those who focused on Hitler\u2019s anti-Semitism were unhappy with the extended comparison between them, while Italian antifascists weren\u2019t totally onboard with how these studies appeared to trivialize their nation\u2019s trauma. Gottfried demonstrates this point as follows:\n\n&gt; In Italy a historiographical tradition reigns on the Left, but some Christian Democrats also treat Italian fascism as a model \u201ctotalitarian\u201d movement. This view has been espoused by such leftist, antifascist historians as Gaetano Salvemini, Luigi Salvatorelli, and Herman Finer, as well as by Catholic traditionalists.\n\nGottfried spars with [Emilio Gentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Gentile), a contemporary historian, over this question. Specifically, his argument that something he calls \u201cpolitical religion\u201d links Italian fascism with the likes of Hitler or Stalin\u2019s regimes. The contention is twofold.\n\n1.\tHow much control did Mussolini have over his citizens\u2019 lives?\n\n2.\tWhat did the fascists mean when they spoke of *totalizzazione*?\n\nAccording to Gottfried, the answers are \u201cnot nearly as much as Hitler or Stalin\u201d and \u201cthe fusion of the state and its members, but not with an all-powerful structure of control.\u201d He ends this argument by pointing out Gentile\u2019s rather odd claim that liberal democracy has no political religion, because this conflicts with the existence (or claimed existence, anyways) of a traditional American civil religion.\n\nWe jump from the end of WW2 to the Cold War. Gottfried cites [*Red Fascism: The Merger of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia in the American Image of Totalitarianism*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1852269) for its work on precisely what the title suggests. According to the authors, America\u2019s view of fascism was later transferred onto the Soviets, providing an already constructed image of the former ally now designated enemy. But this explains the spread of terms like \u201ctotalitarian\u201d and \u201cpolitical religion\u201d into the broader population, not who came up with it.\n\nThat honor goes to the left. Who these people were varied: some were disappointed Trotskyists, others were social democrats, etc. Most declared that Nazi horrors came first, though Nolte disagreed and put Stalin\u2019s horrors as imitated by the fascists and Nazis. Regardless of the ordering, it made (and probably makes) sense to group these two regimes together. Orwell\u2019s 1984 is a good example, as Big Brother has both Stalinist and Nazi features.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the right didn\u2019t also engage in such lumping. Figures like Augusto Del Noce, Gerhart Niemeyer, and other anticommunists also emphasized the similarities of these regimes, but they stressed the godlessness of these governments and the \u201cpoisonous effects of materialist ideologies\u201d. Niemeyer in particular wrote an entire work on how these states were a form of \u201contological negation.\u201d For him, these movements repudiated man\u2019s place in the chain of being, confusing personal will with \u201cthe operation of an infinitely wiser being.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a third factor which some scholars focus on, that being the powerful administrations and bureaucratic centralization. Totalitarian regimes engaged in creating powerful state apparatuses for the regulation and control of all aspects of life while being highly hostile to traditional associations and hierarchies. This interpretation appeals to quite a few people, as it doesn\u2019t exclude modern democracies from being totalitarian. For these individuals, our own societies have fallen to \u201dsoft despotism\u201d, described as follows.\n\n&gt; state management is combined with public education and a media-shaped reality, as a means by which entire populations can have their brains laundered. This arrangement is conducive to a form of groupthink that effectively marginalizes significant opposition. Social engineering is seen as the path toward this strenuously managed society without the overt cruelty that was characteristic of interwar totalitarian leaders. We are therefore made to think that the Nazi and Soviet catastrophes were the cruder, more explosive forms of impersonal, bureaucratic rule, aiming at a kind of manipulation that modern democracies can achieve without violence. In short, interwar dictatorships were physically more destructive forms of what is a characteristically modern process of change.\n\n###The Issue With Arendt\u2019s Formulation\n\nAs powerful as Arendt\u2019s comparisons are, they aren\u2019t without criticisms, which Gottfried brings up now. \nFirstly, Hitler never had as much internal control over his country as Stalin did. Indeed, German Jews up until WW2 were allowed to leave. The economy was far more open than the USSR. Universities were the same as the Nazis were indifferent to what went on there, to the point of allowing non-Nazi and anti-Nazi academics to stay on, which was never the case in the Soviet Union. Ideological conformity was Stalin\u2019s obsession, not Hitler\u2019s (as much, anyways), and Hitler would probably not try the same kind of agricultural collectivization that Stalin did.\n\nBut so what, one might argue. Sure, there are difference in the details, but they surely don\u2019t matter that much, do they? In response to this argument, Gottfried points to a demonstrable case of those details mattering. \n\nIn 1997, *The Black Book of Communism* was published in France and had a controversial response. The topic was the mass murders carried out by communist regimes, but even something as true as this drew considerable backlash by the likes of Lionel Jospin (French PM at the time) and in the media. To quote French journalist Rolan LeRoy, \u201cAt the heart of Communism is love of humanity; at the heart of Nazism is hatred of the human race.\u201d\n\nNor is this an isolated case, Gottfried points to the disparity in both numbers and prestige of those supporting either regime, a disparity that thoroughly benefits the Soviets overs the Nazis. As for why, anthropologist Mircea Eliade offer the following explanation.\n\n&gt; the one inestimable advantage that Marxists and communists enjoy in relation to fascists and other antiegalitarians is their recycling of certain primal myths that are woven into Christianity about the \u201cultimate victory of the suffering Just.\u201d According to Eliade, these myths are so deeply embedded in our minds that political positions that seem to reflect them resonate with intellectuals no matter how disastrously they may turn out in practice.\n\n###Would You Look At That, it\u2019s Time For A Regime Change\n\nGottfried jumps now to an entirely different topic, that of authoritarianism and authoritarian regimes. For Westerners interested in promoting liberal democracy, these regimes are a nuisance. They aren\u2019t democratic, but they\u2019re also reformable. Compared to the likes of the Nazis or Soviets, their repression is mild(er). The descriptions of these states by Western political elites as an \u201calliance of the military with landowners or an anxious bourgeoisie or tribal heads, all of whom are driven by fear of revolutionary upheaval\u201d means they\u2019re seen as unstable and thus in need of intervention before they threaten the US or its interests.\n\nNone of this is new, but the tie-in is the use of the descriptor \u201cfascist\u201d. For Gottfried, this reflects a regime that particularly offends our elites, as it denies that fascist nations are their own form of modern political organization, and they are now deprived of any claim to be revolutionary, as fascism to the elites in question is \u201cintolerably reactionary\u201d. This is not a new claim, to be sure, as it dates back even as early as the 1960s.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t exclude the rise of fascism within Western nations. Gottfried describes one such group of intellectuals as so:\n\n&gt; German intellectuals seem particularly enthralled by this idea of fascism as \u201coperating stealthily\u201d among their fascist-prone nation, although rarely within their own morally intact interiors. As seen from this angle, fascism is a kind of original sin that, unless continuously monitored, may rise to the surface with catastrophic consequences.\n\nAt the journalistic level (and also outside Germany), this manifests with reference to the worst regime i.e Nazi Germany. There\u2019s a reason this takes off in the 1960s, as that\u2019s when the New Left came into being. This left defined fascism as anything opposed to social change and drew support from another simultaneous event \u2013 the declaration of the Holocaust as the \u201cmost decisive event in Jewish history\u201d. In addition, the Soviet thaw had been going on for a while, making a milder and less repressive regime as the excesses of Stalin were rolled back.\n\nThis, Gottfried argues, is how fascism came to be defined as a threat to the human race surpassing communism entirely.\n\nTo summarize this chapter further:\n\n**Fascism and Totalitarianism are not the same thing, and there is considerable proof from even left-wing authors in the aftermath of WW2.

As the studies of fascism and what it means are wide and varied by the beliefs of the people who do them, we cannot understand those criticisms without the context of who makes them. The reason he focuses on totalitarianism is his belief that it has the farthest reach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Totalitarianism is something closely related to the work of Hannah Arendt, a famous 20th-century political philosopher. This view of fascism places a heavy distance between Nazy Germany and the Italian Fascist state. More importantly, it qualitatively equates Stalin\u2019s USSR with that of the Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Totalitarianism as defined by Arendt and Hans Buchheim is radically antitraditional and antiliberal. For Arendt, the ascendancy of this ideology presupposed \u201cthe breakdown of the class system\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u2026the fall of protecting class walls transformed the slumbering majorities behind all parties into one great unorganized, structureless mass of furious individuals who had nothing in common except their vague apprehension that the hopes of party members were doomed, that the most respected, articulate, and representative members of the community were fools and that all powers that be were not so much evil as they were equally stupid and fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others like Friedrich and Brzezinski pointed to modern technology, political chaos, and no firm constitutional tradition as important details for making the governments of Hitler and Stalin. These regimes created ideologies that encompassed all of human life with the goal of a future golden age.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The methods of cementing control were parties, dictators surrounded with true believers, and secret police who smashed dissenters or whatever minorities were the arbitrary enemies. These \u201cenemies\u201d were coincidentally against whatever transformative projects the state had in mind. To this end, these regimes controlled all mass communication and strove to manipulate reality for political ends. There was also a need to be aggressively expansionist. Lastly, the economy was subordinated to state servants, making the dictator total master of all economic relations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was not a welcome definition at the time, the pro-Soviet left and those who focused on Hitler\u2019s anti-Semitism were unhappy with the extended comparison between them, while Italian antifascists weren\u2019t totally onboard with how these studies appeared to trivialize their nation\u2019s trauma. Gottfried demonstrates this point as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In Italy a historiographical tradition reigns on the Left, but some Christian Democrats also treat Italian fascism as a model \u201ctotalitarian\u201d movement. This view has been espoused by such leftist, antifascist historians as Gaetano Salvemini, Luigi Salvatorelli, and Herman Finer, as well as by Catholic traditionalists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried spars with &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Gentile\"&gt;Emilio Gentile&lt;/a&gt;, a contemporary historian, over this question. Specifically, his argument that something he calls \u201cpolitical religion\u201d links Italian fascism with the likes of Hitler or Stalin\u2019s regimes. The contention is twofold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much control did Mussolini have over his citizens\u2019 lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did the fascists mean when they spoke of &lt;em&gt;totalizzazione&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Gottfried, the answers are \u201cnot nearly as much as Hitler or Stalin\u201d and \u201cthe fusion of the state and its members, but not with an all-powerful structure of control.\u201d He ends this argument by pointing out Gentile\u2019s rather odd claim that liberal democracy has no political religion, because this conflicts with the existence (or claimed existence, anyways) of a traditional American civil religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We jump from the end of WW2 to the Cold War. Gottfried cites &lt;a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1852269\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Fascism: The Merger of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia in the American Image of Totalitarianism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for its work on precisely what the title suggests. According to the authors, America\u2019s view of fascism was later transferred onto the Soviets, providing an already constructed image of the former ally now designated enemy. But this explains the spread of terms like \u201ctotalitarian\u201d and \u201cpolitical religion\u201d into the broader population, not who came up with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That honor goes to the left. Who these people were varied: some were disappointed Trotskyists, others were social democrats, etc. Most declared that Nazi horrors came first, though Nolte disagreed and put Stalin\u2019s horrors as imitated by the fascists and Nazis. Regardless of the ordering, it made (and probably makes) sense to group these two regimes together. Orwell\u2019s 1984 is a good example, as Big Brother has both Stalinist and Nazi features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s not to say the right didn\u2019t also engage in such lumping. Figures like Augusto Del Noce, Gerhart Niemeyer, and other anticommunists also emphasized the similarities of these regimes, but they stressed the godlessness of these governments and the \u201cpoisonous effects of materialist ideologies\u201d. Niemeyer in particular wrote an entire work on how these states were a form of \u201contological negation.\u201d For him, these movements repudiated man\u2019s place in the chain of being, confusing personal will with \u201cthe operation of an infinitely wiser being.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a third factor which some scholars focus on, that being the powerful administrations and bureaucratic centralization. Totalitarian regimes engaged in creating powerful state apparatuses for the regulation and control of all aspects of life while being highly hostile to traditional associations and hierarchies. This interpretation appeals to quite a few people, as it doesn\u2019t exclude modern democracies from being totalitarian. For these individuals, our own societies have fallen to \u201dsoft despotism\u201d, described as follows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;state management is combined with public education and a media-shaped reality, as a means by which entire populations can have their brains laundered. This arrangement is conducive to a form of groupthink that effectively marginalizes significant opposition. Social engineering is seen as the path toward this strenuously managed society without the overt cruelty that was characteristic of interwar totalitarian leaders. We are therefore made to think that the Nazi and Soviet catastrophes were the cruder, more explosive forms of impersonal, bureaucratic rule, aiming at a kind of manipulation that modern democracies can achieve without violence. In short, interwar dictatorships were physically more destructive forms of what is a characteristically modern process of change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Issue With Arendt\u2019s Formulation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As powerful as Arendt\u2019s comparisons are, they aren\u2019t without criticisms, which Gottfried brings up now. \nFirstly, Hitler never had as much internal control over his country as Stalin did. Indeed, German Jews up until WW2 were allowed to leave. The economy was far more open than the USSR. Universities were the same as the Nazis were indifferent to what went on there, to the point of allowing non-Nazi and anti-Nazi academics to stay on, which was never the case in the Soviet Union. Ideological conformity was Stalin\u2019s obsession, not Hitler\u2019s (as much, anyways), and Hitler would probably not try the same kind of agricultural collectivization that Stalin did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But so what, one might argue. Sure, there are difference in the details, but they surely don\u2019t matter that much, do they? In response to this argument, Gottfried points to a demonstrable case of those details mattering. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1997, &lt;em&gt;The Black Book of Communism&lt;/em&gt; was published in France and had a controversial response. The topic was the mass murders carried out by communist regimes, but even something as true as this drew considerable backlash by the likes of Lionel Jospin (French PM at the time) and in the media. To quote French journalist Rolan LeRoy, \u201cAt the heart of Communism is love of humanity; at the heart of Nazism is hatred of the human race.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nor is this an isolated case, Gottfried points to the disparity in both numbers and prestige of those supporting either regime, a disparity that thoroughly benefits the Soviets overs the Nazis. As for why, anthropologist Mircea Eliade offer the following explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the one inestimable advantage that Marxists and communists enjoy in relation to fascists and other antiegalitarians is their recycling of certain primal myths that are woven into Christianity about the \u201cultimate victory of the suffering Just.\u201d According to Eliade, these myths are so deeply embedded in our minds that political positions that seem to reflect them resonate with intellectuals no matter how disastrously they may turn out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Would You Look At That, it\u2019s Time For A Regime Change&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried jumps now to an entirely different topic, that of authoritarianism and authoritarian regimes. For Westerners interested in promoting liberal democracy, these regimes are a nuisance. They aren\u2019t democratic, but they\u2019re also reformable. Compared to the likes of the Nazis or Soviets, their repression is mild(er). The descriptions of these states by Western political elites as an \u201calliance of the military with landowners or an anxious bourgeoisie or tribal heads, all of whom are driven by fear of revolutionary upheaval\u201d means they\u2019re seen as unstable and thus in need of intervention before they threaten the US or its interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of this is new, but the tie-in is the use of the descriptor \u201cfascist\u201d. For Gottfried, this reflects a regime that particularly offends our elites, as it denies that fascist nations are their own form of modern political organization, and they are now deprived of any claim to be revolutionary, as fascism to the elites in question is \u201cintolerably reactionary\u201d. This is not a new claim, to be sure, as it dates back even as early as the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, this doesn\u2019t exclude the rise of fascism within Western nations. Gottfried describes one such group of intellectuals as so:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;German intellectuals seem particularly enthralled by this idea of fascism as \u201coperating stealthily\u201d among their fascist-prone nation, although rarely within their own morally intact interiors. As seen from this angle, fascism is a kind of original sin that, unless continuously monitored, may rise to the surface with catastrophic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the journalistic level (and also outside Germany), this manifests with reference to the worst regime i.e Nazi Germany. There\u2019s a reason this takes off in the 1960s, as that\u2019s when the New Left came into being. This left defined fascism as anything opposed to social change and drew support from another simultaneous event \u2013 the declaration of the Holocaust as the \u201cmost decisive event in Jewish history\u201d. In addition, the Soviet thaw had been going on for a while, making a milder and less repressive regime as the excesses of Stalin were rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This, Gottfried argues, is how fascism came to be defined as a threat to the human race surpassing communism entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To summarize this chapter further:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fascism and Totalitarianism are not the same thing, and there is considerable proof from even left-wing authors in the aftermath of WW2. However, we should also not treat the two totalitarian regimes (Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia) as functionally equal, because the differences do matter. The birth of the modern view of fascism as a strictly right-wing/reactionary ideology that lurks in our hearts and poses the foremost threat to humanity comes from the 1960s and the rise of the New Left.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time, we\u2019ll look at Chapter 3 - Fascism as the Unconquered Past.

It\u2019s a term gets thrown around a lot in politics, typically by the left against the right. Accusations fly through the air that [Republicans are fascist]( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=republicans+fascist&amp;atb=v314-1&amp;ia=web), [conservatives are fascist]( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=conservatives+fascist&amp;atb=v314-1&amp;ia=web), [alt-righters are fascist]( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=alt-right+fascist&amp;atb=v314-1&amp;ia=web), etc. At least, that\u2019s what I find when I just search the first page of Google at the time of writing.\n\nThe right has responded with its own defenses, some of which can be summarized as [\u201cNo u\u201d]( https://jonahgoldberg.com/liberal-fascism/).\n\nBut this leaves us with no choice but to dive into some serious study ourselves if we want to evaluate the claims in salient politics, and I\u2019ve chosen Paul Gottfried\u2019s [*Fascism: Career of a Concept*]( https://direct.mit.edu/jinh/article-abstract/48/1/84/49307/Fascism-The-Career-of-a-Concept?redirectedFrom=fulltext), published in 2016, to start with.\n\n##Who?\n\nPaul Gottfried is a historian who, it turns out, coined the term \u201calt-right\u201d. His [Wikipedia page]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gottfried) tells us some good details.\n\n&gt; \u2026an American paleoconservative philosopher, historian, and columnist\u2026Gottfried coined terms such as \"paleoconservative\" (which he identifies with) and \"alternative right\" (which he rejects).\n\nGottfried is no friend of the alt-right, he\u2019s denounced the alt-right as a bunch of white nationalists who are pro-Nazi. Therefore, the easy criticism, that he\u2019s actually just a fascist or Nazi and that\u2019s why he wrote a book which rejects most of the contemporary left\u2019s usage of the term, is not so easy to make.\n\nOr maybe he\u2019s just lying about this all. In any case, it\u2019s always worthwhile to ask who\u2019s writing the books we read. Gottfried, after all, has just as much of an incentive to claim \u201cactually, there\u2019s no fascism on the right and the left are the real fascists\u201d as anyone else.\n\n##Chapter 1\n\n###What Even is Fascism?\n\nGottfried starts by asking if there even is a thing we can call \u201cfascism\u201d. Is there a \u201cconsistent body of ideas\u201d, or is fascism just a reaction to other ideologies and movements? This is a crucial question: if fascism is just a reaction to certain ideologies, then anyone who opposes those ideologies now or in the future could be called a fascist.\n\nGerman historian [Ernst Nolte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Nolte) certainly thought so, arguing that fascism is about counterrevolution against the left i.e. it shouldn\u2019t be thought of as anything independent of the situation that birthed it. Nolte described the fascists as just using leftist tactics and their revolutionary spirit against their enemies. For Nolte, the central conflict was around rejecting \u201ca *leitmotiv* that appeared in Christian theology and throughout the revolutionary Left, namely, that human beings could be morally transformed and raised above their natural condition to become more fully human or less beastlike. The fascists exalted what was primordially collectivist, or biologically rooted, and in the end pieced together a counter-vision to the teachings of their enemies.\u201d\n\nGottfried rejects this idea. He cites historian [Francois Furet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Furet) who highlighted that fascism was distant from 19th-century counterrevolutionary ideas. According to Furet, fascism wasn\u2019t just a rejection of the left, it was a different vision of the future altogether. Furet pointed to the Fascist International Congress in December 1934 which had tremendous participation and enthusiasm, the likes of which could not have occurred if it was purely reactionary. Gottfried acknowledges that it\u2019s fallacious to assume a reactionary movement can\u2019t elicit large amounts of enthusiasm, but he mentions that Nolte provided reasons why this is plausible.\n\n&gt; the fascists, including their more savage Nazi cousins, were perceived as the enemies of the Bolsheviks and the Jewish allies of international Marxism. They were thought to be standing with the good people in the battle between communism and anticommunism or between bourgeois Christian and socialist-atheist societies.\n\nGottfried contrasts Nolte\u2019s view with that of [James A. Gregor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._James_Gregor), someone who argued that there was most definitely such an ideology and it was rationally defended by its adherents without them being insane or stupid. According to him, fascists saw themselves as promoting a world equally as just and inevitable as the socialists or communists. He saw fascism as dangerous to liberal institutions because it offered persuasive arguments about how humans and the world worked. Indeed, he went as far as to argue that fascism was more dangerous because it made, at times, a terrifying amount of sense in comparison to the Marxists and their ideas of something like an international proletariat. \n\nHistorian [Stanley Payne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_G._Payne) is cited as the middle ground. For Payne, the fascists\u2019 stated enemies are fairly constant: \u201cparliamentarianism, left-wing socialism, internationalism (except in a form acceptable to the fascists), free market capitalism, Freemasons, and pacifists.\u201d Payne argues that the origins of fascism can be found in France\u2019s Third Republic in which a new right emerged that \u201crejected parliamentary institutions and capitalism, but with a strongly nationalist character\u201d. He notes, perhaps to your amusement and certainly to mine, that France created both the revolutionary and fascist counterrevolutionary that spread across Europe. Payne\u2019s [*Fascism: Comparison and Definition*](https://history.wisc.edu/publications/fascism-comparison-and-definition/) also gives the following common characteristics to fascism: \u201cpermanent nationalistic one-party authoritarianism,\u201d \u201cthe search for a synthetic ethnicist ideology,\u201d a charismatic leader, a corporatist political economy, and \u201ca philosophical principle of voluntarist activism unbounded by any philosophical determinism.\n\nGottfried steps back in now, arguing that although there may have been some similarities between the traditional European right and these fascists, they should not be equated. Going a step further, he says that we cannot equate the fascists with any nationalist right who assented to operate in any parliamentary method. The fascists strongly rejected parliamentarianism.\n\n###Right or Left?\n\nGottfried moves to a question with modern salience: is fascism a right or left-wing idea/ideology?\nIf you say \u201cright-wing, obviously\u201d, Gottfried disagrees. He argues that this answer is rooted in idea that it was a counterrevolution to socialism and communism and the \u201cintimate relations that existed between fascist governments and big business.\u201d The Italian fascist state ended the liberal status quo in which the Catholic Church was excluded from government, while Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan allied to fight international communism. Thus, a right-wing movement.\n\nFor Gottfried, many of these criticisms don\u2019t make sense unless you also keep in mind the backgrounds of the critics. People like James Burnham (a prominent Trotskyist in the 30s) and Ernst Nolte had adopted a Marxist viewpoint prior in their lives which, Gottfried argues, influenced how they wrote even if their beliefs changed later. Burnham\u2019s [*The Managerial Revolution*]( https://www.amazon.com/Managerial-Revolution-What-Happening-World/dp/0837156785) argued that fascism was just a different form of managerial rule in a post-bourgeois, not quite post-capitalist society, but his view was based on Trotsky\u2019s own view of how the Soviet Union was managerially derailed and socialist following Lenin\u2019s death. Nolte viewed fascism with the assumption that the conflict between revolutionary and counterrevolutionaries in Europe could not be universalized and were specific to the areas they happened in (presumably out of the belief that you couldn\u2019t have a socialist or communist nation without industrializing first).\n\nGregor disagreed with Nolte. For him, fascism was a revolutionary movement and he treated it like \u201can infectious variation of Marxism\u2026in which the nation is substituted for the working class and in which  socialist collectivism is preserved without the dream of an economically liberated humankind\u201d. For Gregor, fascist theory contains references to a collectivist \u201cmankind\u201d that echoes Marx and fascists often used Marxist ideas with the causes and targets changed. They created, according to him, their own variation on Marx\u2019s \u201cprehistory\u201d to describe human existence before socialism. His evidence was fascist documents from the 1920s with quotes like \u201cthe Italian nation is an organism having ends, life,  and means of action that are superior in power and continuity to those of the divided and organized  individuals who compose it. It is a moral, political and economic unity, which realizes itself in the fascist state.\u201d\n\nAs Gottfried points out, many fascists including Mussolini were *transfuges* from the left, dividable into those who apparently had real changes of heart and those who collaborated with the Nazis after France fell. Former communists or socialists who changed camps were not exceptional, it happened all across Europe and even in America.\n\nWhy did they do this? For some, it was just going with the flow (fascism was the most up-to-date social-political order), and they moved back to socialism/communism after it failed. For state-planners, they didn\u2019t care who ruled as long as they got to try their proposals. But there was considerable support from non-Italian progressives due to fascism\u2019s reorganization of the economy for the purpose of modernization, Gottfried argues. The progressives of this time were capable of admiring both fascists and communists.\n\n###The Fascist Spectrum\n\nHaving established the various types of fascist movements: Italian, Spanish, German, etc., Gottfried now puts these movements on a spectrum to show the common or distinctive features they have.\n\nOn one side are Austian clerical fascism and the Spanish Falange, which blended \u201ca corporatist theory of the state, taken from such sources as Thomism and the encyclicals of Popes Leo XIII and Pius XI, with plans for a national authoritarian government.\u201d These movements didn\u2019t have any general theory of race or racial anti-Semitism as their foundation. \n\nAt the other end are the Nazis, Croatia\u2019s Ustashi, and Hungary\u2019s Arrow Cross party. Nolte describes these as \u201cradical fascists\u201d who were genocidally anti-Semitic and controlled tightly by Nazi Germany. These collaborators, Gottfried argues, could be better defined less as fascist and more as \u201canti-parliamentary national movements that combined anti-Semitism with anti-bolshevism.\u201d For example, Spain\u2019s Franco put fascist movements into his ruling coalition, but he reduced their power. Gottfried describes some of his policies as such:\n\n&gt; \u2026pro-Axis youth were sent off to die in the Blue Division fighting for the Third Reich in Russia; meanwhile, dissident Spanish fascists were jailed or encouraged to leave the country if they did not accept the increasingly technocratic regime of the victorious Caudillo.\n\nIn a bit of historiography, Gottfried details some of the issues with talking about any common fascist traits. Several countries in the interwar period were under governments or parties with a \u201cfascist style\u201d, but this was akin to how nations power-WW2 would appropriate some of America or the Soviet Union\u2019s governmental aspects and call themselves democratic. How can historians decide what is real and what is not? Some try to get around this excluding Catholic authoritarians and Nazis from the category of fascist due to their conflict with each other (see: Austria\u2019s Dollfuss), but is this right? \n\nGottfried points out we can at least say the following:\n\n1.\tItalian fascism, German Nazism, and their respective allies are different in ways apart from how much they cared about bolshevism or committing genocide. In particular, racism and anti-Semitism are not integral to fascism.\n\n2.\tFascist movements did not see themselves as running \u201ccaretaker governments\u201d like the conventional authoritarian right, they saw themselves as revolutionaries in the same vein as 19th-century national democratic movements.\n\nGottfried now changes tracks to disappoint any right-winger who may be looking to prove that fascism is a left-wing idea. He notes that while the traditional right very eagerly supports this idea of fascism as a variant of Marxism, this stems from a view that all attacks on traditional authority are left-wing. But this ignores that following issues:\n\n1. There was no place for a revolutionary nationalist who wanted a corporate economy on the left. \n2. Fascists often rose to power as adversaries of the left.\n3. The fascists were not the first people with right-wing characteristics to condemn the free market or use \u201cplebiscitary democracy\u201d. \n4. The fascists did not incite or even try to incite socioeconomic revolution. As Gottfried explains:\n\n&gt; Italian fascists renamed economic actors in order to make them fit a corporatist model. They declared the state to be free to interfere in production, but the fascist state asserted this right in a limited way, though perhaps less often than \u201cdemocratic capitalist\u201d countries that are on the way to becoming social democracies.\n\nGottfried criticizes Gregor as well, claiming that his attempts at comparing fascists to Marxist-Leninists are less than convincing. Mussolini and the fascists provided sustained support and close relationships to Italy\u2019s *ambienti industriali*, or industrial elite. Hilter\u2019s first economic minister, Hjalmar Schacht, was very pro-capitalist and the reason why Nazi Germany didn\u2019t engage in farm subsidies like the New Deal in America.\n\nThus ends Chapter 1. To summarize Gottfried\u2019s arguments further:\n\n**Fascism is a real ideology that had its own independent thoughts. Its defenders did not see themselves as conservative but creating a new sociopolitical order that offered an alternative to socialism or communism with equal revolutionary energy. Lumping Nazi Germany and its collaborator movements with Fascist Italy and its allies makes important differences disappear. Fascism seems to be a mostly, if not strictly, interwar phenomenon that cannot be defined as solely left-wing or right-wing.**\n\nNext time, we\u2019ll go over Chapter 2, titled \u201cFascism and Totalitarianism\u201d.

It\u2019s a term gets thrown around a lot in politics, typically by the left against the right. Accusations fly through the air that &lt;a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=republicans+fascist&amp;amp;atb=v314-1&amp;amp;ia=web\"&gt;Republicans are fascist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=conservatives+fascist&amp;amp;atb=v314-1&amp;amp;ia=web\"&gt;conservatives are fascist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=alt-right+fascist&amp;amp;atb=v314-1&amp;amp;ia=web\"&gt;alt-righters are fascist&lt;/a&gt;, etc. At least, that\u2019s what I find when I just search the first page of Google at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The right has responded with its own defenses, some of which can be summarized as &lt;a href=\"https://jonahgoldberg.com/liberal-fascism/\"&gt;\u201cNo u\u201d&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this leaves us with no choice but to dive into some serious study ourselves if we want to evaluate the claims in salient politics, and I\u2019ve chosen Paul Gottfried\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/jinh/article-abstract/48/1/84/49307/Fascism-The-Career-of-a-Concept?redirectedFrom=fulltext\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fascism: Career of a Concept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2016, to start with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Who?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Paul Gottfried is a historian who, it turns out, coined the term \u201calt-right\u201d. His &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gottfried\"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; tells us some good details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u2026an American paleoconservative philosopher, historian, and columnist\u2026Gottfried coined terms such as &amp;quot;paleoconservative&amp;quot; (which he identifies with) and &amp;quot;alternative right&amp;quot; (which he rejects).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried is no friend of the alt-right, he\u2019s denounced the alt-right as a bunch of white nationalists who are pro-Nazi. Therefore, the easy criticism, that he\u2019s actually just a fascist or Nazi and that\u2019s why he wrote a book which rejects most of the contemporary left\u2019s usage of the term, is not so easy to make.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe he\u2019s just lying about this all. In any case, it\u2019s always worthwhile to ask who\u2019s writing the books we read. Gottfried, after all, has just as much of an incentive to claim \u201cactually, there\u2019s no fascism on the right and the left are the real fascists\u201d as anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What Even is Fascism?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried starts by asking if there even is a thing we can call \u201cfascism\u201d. Is there a \u201cconsistent body of ideas\u201d, or is fascism just a reaction to other ideologies and movements? This is a crucial question: if fascism is just a reaction to certain ideologies, then anyone who opposes those ideologies now or in the future could be called a fascist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;German historian &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Nolte\"&gt;Ernst Nolte&lt;/a&gt; certainly thought so, arguing that fascism is about counterrevolution against the left i.e. it shouldn\u2019t be thought of as anything independent of the situation that birthed it. Nolte described the fascists as just using leftist tactics and their revolutionary spirit against their enemies. For Nolte, the central conflict was around rejecting \u201ca &lt;em&gt;leitmotiv&lt;/em&gt; that appeared in Christian theology and throughout the revolutionary Left, namely, that human beings could be morally transformed and raised above their natural condition to become more fully human or less beastlike. The fascists exalted what was primordially collectivist, or biologically rooted, and in the end pieced together a counter-vision to the teachings of their enemies.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried rejects this idea. He cites historian &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Furet\"&gt;Francois Furet&lt;/a&gt; who highlighted that fascism was distant from 19th-century counterrevolutionary ideas. According to Furet, fascism wasn\u2019t just a rejection of the left, it was a different vision of the future altogether. Furet pointed to the Fascist International Congress in December 1934 which had tremendous participation and enthusiasm, the likes of which could not have occurred if it was purely reactionary. Gottfried acknowledges that it\u2019s fallacious to assume a reactionary movement can\u2019t elicit large amounts of enthusiasm, but he mentions that Nolte provided reasons why this is plausible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the fascists, including their more savage Nazi cousins, were perceived as the enemies of the Bolsheviks and the Jewish allies of international Marxism. They were thought to be standing with the good people in the battle between communism and anticommunism or between bourgeois Christian and socialist-atheist societies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried contrasts Nolte\u2019s view with that of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._James_Gregor\"&gt;James A. Gregor&lt;/a&gt;, someone who argued that there was most definitely such an ideology and it was rationally defended by its adherents without them being insane or stupid.

For Payne, the fascists\u2019 stated enemies are fairly constant: \u201cparliamentarianism, left-wing socialism, internationalism (except in a form acceptable to the fascists), free market capitalism, Freemasons, and pacifists.\u201d Payne argues that the origins of fascism can be found in France\u2019s Third Republic in which a new right emerged that \u201crejected parliamentary institutions and capitalism, but with a strongly nationalist character\u201d.

Not in the same way Ukraine is, it won't collapse completely exhausted by the war.

Any increase of tension between nuclear powers increases the change of nuclear war, but its an extremely small increase. If a conventional war escalated to a nuclear war it would almost certainly be because of Russian use of nuclear weapons because it was losing to NATO, but the conventional war has about a zero percent chance of breaking out precisely because of nuclear deterrence. And even in a world with no nuclear weapons would still be fairly unlikely. NATO doesn't want to attack Russia, and Russia would be insane to attack NATO at this point even if there were no nuclear weapons.\n\nEdit - I realized I forgot to link to the video.
