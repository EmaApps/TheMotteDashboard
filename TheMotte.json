['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 29, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_x0hc17", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661753708.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

But not through naturalization or birth; I used an uncommon route with a new and somewhat strange process: a StAG section (\u00a7) 5 declaration. While going through this, I had learned a lot about that citizenship laws of Germany and some comparisons with other countries, as well as spending (too much) time browsing various expat and citizenship forums and subreddits. I\u2019d like to ~~subject you to~~ share with you what I\u2019ve learned in this weird journey, through intergenerational citizenship and questions of national identity.\n\n###Background\n\nWith so many immigrants out there, why should you listen to me, an American moving between western countries? Well, I, personally, value it more when people put in effort for something with less assured payoff; few want to split lottery tickets, everyone wants to split the winnings. Similarly, I moved to Germany as someone with only German heritage, as a normal immigrant, and then more than a year after that a new law offered me a privileged path to citizenship through legal magic. In short, I committed to Germany and then received the winning lottery ticket.\n\nA bit more about my path: I moved to Germany in 2020 with the [EU Blue Card] (https://www.bamf.de/EN/Themen/MigrationAufenthalt/ZuwandererDrittstaaten/Migrathek/BlaueKarteEU/blauekarteeu-node.html) for highly qualified immigrants. I chose Germany because part of my family was from Germany, and in the typical American style I considered myself German-American. I had visited Germany and liked it, although I knew visiting and living somewhere are two very different things. But what I would really like to stress is that visiting Germany felt like visiting a home, a place that felt natural. I\u2019ve visited plenty of other countries, and everywhere else it was clear that they were foreign, \u201calien\u201d countries. It was obvious when I was in Japan that no matter how much I might like visiting castles or eating ramen, Japan would remain a foreign country. When it was unclear whether I would be still working in Germany, a friend suggested that I work with them in the Netherlands, and a big hangup was that the Netherlands was a foreign country, this despite the fact that they speak more English and I would be around more English-speaking expats. Germany was the ancestral homeland, and no other country could ever replace that.\n\nGerman citizenship is based primarily on *jus sanguinis*, citizenship by blood: someone is a German citizen at birth because their parents were citizens. But this was, in the past, primarily patrilineal. In fact, the German citizenship in my family was cut off when my German grandmother married a foreigner: she automatically lost her German citizenship, rendering her stateless and all her children non-Germans, including my father, and all of her grandchildren were not German either, including me.\n\nIn August 2021 Germany passed an amendment to the Staatsangeh\u00f6rigkeitsgesetz (StAG), or nationality law. The new StAG \u00a7 5 allows those who, to quote the federal authority, \u201cwere previously excluded by gender-discriminatory regulations from acquiring German citizenship at birth may now acquire it by [way of declaration.] (https://www.bva.bund.de/EN/Services/Citizens/ID-Documents-Law/Citizenship/4_StAG/german_citizenship_law.html) Briefly, the post-war German Basic Law (a constitution) forbids gender discrimination, and so those who were excluded from acquiring citizenship due to this gender discrimination could [claim it back] (https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stag/englisch_stag.html); for example, until 1975, German women would not pass down citizenship by default. The process is new enough that the relevant authority here in Germany, in a major city, did not know about it. But I collected all of our old documents, submitted my application, and now (as of the time of writing) the certificate is in the mail in hand!\n\nI did it, I became a German citizen! I did not naturalize, I gained citizenship through declaration (queue up, \u201cI didn\u2019t say citizenship, I declared it!\u201d). I did not have to reside in Germany for 6-8 years, I did not have to speak German, pass any test, pay any money or do anything at all but submit a few documents and citizenship was handed down in a puff of magical legal smoke by a bureaucrat I\u2019ve never met before. If I suffered some brain damage I could commit terrorism or racially motivated crimes, things that would have excluded me before, and still keep the citizenship (I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll test that though). And my children will also be German citizens from birth, and their children, and so on forever, just as it had been passed down to me from forever ago (well, at least since 1871).\n\nBut importantly, I haven\u2019t been saying that I became German. I don\u2019t speak German, I didn\u2019t grow up in Germany, and neither did my parents. By the Basic Law, I am a German because I hold German citizenship, but I try to look past the purely legal standing. I don\u2019t think the idea of who is German has a really clear and universal answer; different people and different Germans give different answers. Perhaps we can talk about the traits of Germans, but until we have access to the pure and perfect German Form, arguments are really all we can get. I will reference that concept of being a German plenty though, and the legal vs. cultural German.\n\nThat gives my background and stake in the matter, and it will make for a nice dinner party story but isn\u2019t that important. In fact, nothing really changes legally for me anyway, my permit covered it all before. I think it\u2019s much more interesting to talk about what I\u2019ve learned along the way, as it might actually be interesting and useful for everyone else. So here it goes!\n\n###The Strangeness of Descent Laws\n\nGerman citizenship by descent is a mess, but it\u2019s interesting to take a little dip into the law. Before I only said that German citizenship is based on descent, which glosses over many of the complications that arise in tracing that path. A nice guide on the process can be found [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/citizenship). The US (and most countries in the Americas) use primarily jus soli or birthright citizenship, i.e. you are a citizen of a country if you are born in that country, but also has [citizenship by descent] (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Acquisition-US-Citizenship-Child-Born-Abroad.html). But it\u2019s much more restrictive; in particular, while German citizenship by descent is basically limitless, US citizenship by descent requires that if e.g. the child has two citizen parents, at least one resided in the US at any point, or if only one parent is a US citizen they must have resided in the US for at least five years. I call this a \u201csunset clause\u201d in citizenship, something that terminates citizenship automatically without a connection to the home country.\n\nWithout a solid sunset clause in the German citizenship by descent, you get some (in my personal view) strange lines of descent. Someone whose great-great-great-grandfather left Germany in the late 1800s can be a German citizen directly if it happens to pass only through the male line in key years. Compare this to someone whose German mother married a foreigner and they were born in 1948; their path to citizenship would be under StAG \u00a714, and they have to establish a close connection to Germany, such as speaking German and having close family members in Germany. Here we see that you can only be a legal German if you establish that you are already a cultural German. Add on to this complications such as if your parents naturalized before or after you were born, if you served in a foreign military, if you every voluntarily gained citizenship of another country, and it gets complicated. To note, Germany has added a sunset clause: if a German citizen is born abroad after 1999, any of their children born abroad only retain German citizenship if the authorities are notified before the [child\u2019s first birthday] (https://www.germany.info/us-en/service/03-Citizenship/german-citizenship-acquired-through-notification-of-birth-occuring-abroad/943378). No more surprise citizenships by descent a hundred years down the line.\n\nAll of this has led to a lot of people sorting through old paperwork to find out if they are secretly German citizens or can become one. I like to point to the growth of r/GermanCitizenship as [part of it] (https://subredditstats.com/r/germancitizenship), but the perhaps better known example is for Italy, where it is popular enough to have consular wait times in years and a [CNN article about it] (https://web.archive.org/web/20220621175345/https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-citizenship-007-documents-francesco-curione/index.html). I\u2019ll just voice my personal opinion that all of this is a little strange to me; when one out of sixteen or thirty-two of your ancestors at a particular level came from a particular country, it\u2019s hard for me to see where exactly your connection comes in. The legal case may be perfectly fine, but the cultural part falls through. I normally see it chalked up to \u201chonoring ancestors\u201d or \u201ckeeping their memory alive,\u201d which turns into an excuse to have a nice passport and travel the EU visa-free as far as I\u2019ve seen.\n\nAnd I should mention that Germany, in principle, discourages dual citizenship. If you naturalize, you normally must give up other citizenships, if it is possible and doesn\u2019t cause undue hardship. Notably, the fees to renounce US citizenship are high enough that the authorities may permit you to keep US citizenship if you make less per month than the fees, $2,350. It also permits dual citizenship if other citizenships were gained automatically, i.e. from birthright. There are many exceptions nowadays, but the principle still exists, and causes problems sometimes when e.g. people are forced to [choose a nationality] (https://web.archive.org/web/20210220071357/https:/www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/world/europe/16iht-letter16.html).\n\nFinally, I will point out that StAG \u00a75 vs. \u00a714 (post- vs. pre- Basic Law) seems weird to me. A German woman could lose her citizenship by marrying a foreigner in e.g. 1947, have a child in 1948 then one in 1950; the first would have to prove their ties to Germany, while the second would get in without any restrictions, but in both cases the relevant legal situation that caused the loss of citizenship is the same and only stopped in 1950(ish). For the second child, the claim would be that because the Basic Law forbids gender discrimination, they were unfairly discriminated because they should have been able to obtain citizenship from a female parent. I\u2019m not a jurist but the legal idea seems fraught: how could laws prohibiting an action in the future justify retroactive corrections? But \u00a75 covers much more than that, affecting people born as late as 1993.\n\nBut the biggest takeaway from all of this is that I have the impression that citizenship laws oftentimes are capricious and arbitrary, relying on old documents that some may or may not have and offering various paths or restrictions that change over time. Countries try to both preserve a legal basis for citizenship while trying to reasonably restrict it, while working under changing social views and massive changes in the way the world works.\n\nI think a look at the citizenship laws is helpful mostly to find out that they don\u2019t really answer anything but a legal question, which is important but not what I\u2019m after. I hope no one thinks that someone born to a German mother and a foreign father in 1974 is definitely not a citizen while a sibling born in 1976 definitely is, even if the legal situation is clear.\n\n###The Reddit Expatriation Community\n\nThat\u2019s enough about citizenship laws then. I was fascinated by (potential) immigrants, especially on Reddit, that I came across in my browsing. As an American, I grew up with the idea that America was the land of immigration and that immigration only really flowed one-way. I think the statistics bears this out, with the US having one of the lowest shares of its [population living abroad] (https://www.statista.com/chart/4237/the-countries-with-the-most-people-living-overseas/). Why would someone leave the freest and richest country?\n\nI feel like this is changing, slowly. As other countries become richer, it becomes less clear that America is the automatic best option, and it is probably easier; I can do things like videocall my parents every week and translate written text on my phone, things that make it vastly easier to emigrate. And let\u2019s be clear, the advantage of being a natural Anglophone is huge. On Reddit, which I think is primarily dominated by Americans and Anglophones in general, some of the migration-focused subreddits have seen a lot of growth: [Amerexit](https://subredditstats.com/r/amerexit), [iwantout](https://subredditstats.com/r/iwantout),and [expats] (https://subredditstats.com/r/expats). Those are my three favorite (or at least most entertaining) subreddits, and they run the gamut from \u201cAmerica sucks, I want to leave!\u201d to \u201cHow can I leave my current country (serious answers only)?\u201d to \u201cLiving in a foreign country sucks in so many ways.\u201d Pick your favorite, I guess. And like in everything else, politics is the mind-poison in immigration. But there are many common themes; I\u2019ll reference posts without linking to avoid inter-subreddit drama.\n\nI think most of these immigrants, and probably most immigrants in general, are what I would call \u201cmaterialist immigrants.\u201d Most people are looking to improve their economic situation or living standards. How they rate these things is up to them; someone may value high salaries directly, while others value more consistent healthcare coverage or walkable neighborhoods. If they\u2019re from a western country they may consider themselves (and others like them) an [expat instead of an immigrant] (https://www.google.com/search?q=expat+vs+immigrant+reddit), but it all amounts to the same thing. Even that German citizenship guide I linked before explains the benefits of becoming a German citizen in almost [purely economic terms] (https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/citizenship#wiki_benefits_of_german_citizenship): live and work in the EU! Travel visa-free in so many places with a German passport! Go to university for free! If you\u2019re destitute, Germany will take care of you! Drawbacks: none, you don\u2019t have to learn German or pay any taxes or do anything at all for anyone else.\n\nAnd the discussions reflect this living-standard/economic focus, and an entirely Ameri-centric view. Currently in r/AmerExit, someone is hating on the US because\u2026 (checks subreddit) they can find cheap mineral water while on vacation in Italy. No, I\u2019m not joking, it\u2019s the first point in a top post at the time of writing. Someone may fear American politics enough to instead move to Turkey, a country that literally went through an attempted military coup in 2016 and has a nice book review regarding [Erdogan-as-dictator on ACX] (https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-new-sultan). Or a contemporary favorite, overlooking the fact that many countries have more strict abortion laws than some US states.\n\nWhen looking for somewhere to go, I see so often that people think of moving to completely different countries, treating them all the same as if \u201cwestern European\u201d covered everything they need. One person might say Germany and\u2026 Wales? How about the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Germany, France or the UK? Another might want to move to Ireland or Scandinavia, but they speak fluent Spanish. Countries are interchangeable, as long as they have some greenery, good weather and everyone there aligns with their values. Everyone is \u201cwilling to learn the language,\u201d a completely costless declaration that I always translate to, \u201cI may learn to swim if you throw me in the middle of the ocean.\u201d Even at the end of the natural process, I can see someone declare that they are finally an \u201cEU citizen\u201d after eight years as if their citizenship was granted by Brussels and not their home country.\n\nBeyond the standard internet/Reddit stupidity, these feel like they cover an individualist- and money-focused worldview. And it naturally feeds materialist immigration that disregards the people who actually live in these places, which causes critical problems in adjusting to a life in a foreign country. Remember what I said about r/expats? It\u2019s the opposite version of r/AmerExit, where people have gone to a foreign country and found that, yeah, it\u2019s not America. This is what happens in the culture-clash. The day-to-day reality of living in a country that sees the sun for a few hours a day in the winter sets in. Of dealing with people who will always treat you like a foreigner. Of being far away from family and former friends. It\u2019s tough to live somewhere far away from home, and it\u2019s tough to know that before you actually make the move.\n\nBut\u2026 why is it tough? I haven\u2019t seen many expats complaining about their jobs, most complain about the people around them and their social life. And the world seems very thoroughly Americanized: I visit American-style department stores, see advertisements in English, I can almost always ask to speak English with people, it all sounds very convenient to and for me. They have the healthcare and sparkling water they so desperately desired. What\u2019s missing? Why can\u2019t they assimilate?\n\n###Death by 1000 (Cultural) Cuts\n\nAn insightful and heartfelt Reddit comment put the culture-fit problem as something like a multitude of tiny interactions that cause friction for the immigrant and make it clear that they do not \u201cbelong\u201d in that society. In the end, they\u2019re left miserable and desperate for something that brings them comfort and familiarity, a sense of home in a foreign land. That\u2019s hard to quantify, but we can work around it a bit and hopefully get some sense of it. To borrow a little from conflict vs. mistake theory, I see assimilation oftentimes described as a problem to be solved, a set of cultural ideas and language to learn. Germany\u2019s naturalization requirements include B1 German language level and passing a 33-question test. That doesn\u2019t seem like much; a B1 level may be 500 hours total of study, and I see timeframes of months for that. How can a rich American expat fail to integrate anywhere, when the skills they need take just a few months of work?\n\nThe mistake theory view treats assimilation like a set of instructions: cultural problem in, cultural solution out. It treats it like\u2026 well, like a language, you just have to learn it and speak it fluently to fit in. There should be no reason that one cannot assimilate into any and every culture, you only need to learn the cultural framework to give the right answers at the right time. I\u2019d even say it treats it like a [Chinese room] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room) of culture.\n\nBut the Chinese room substitutes external verification for internal motivation. Yeah, you can answer me these questions (thirty) three, but does that mean you understand them? Do you care about them? Even then, does it really make you a citizen? Why would a set of multiple-choice questions denote the bright threshold between our ingroup and outgroup, the citizens and the foreigners? To give you an idea of the test, [check here] (https://www.lebenindeutschland.eu/), it includes such stumpers as \u201cpick out your state\u2019s flag\u201d and \u201cwhat was the war between 1939-1945 called?\u201d. I took the test, despite speaking only minimal German, for a state that I don\u2019t live in and passed with 21/33; it\u2019s just not that hard.\n\nWhat might a conflict theory view suggest? Well, one useful element from it is that the direction of movement is what matters; things never stay the same, conflict is pervasive over scarce resources. Then the struggle is not a matter of fact to be decided with a solution at the end, but a struggle of power. While conflict theory is based on conflict between social groups, I would apply it here to the internal conflict of assimilation: the immigrant, to adjust, does not need just to learn the language and culture but must internalize the \u201cculture\u201d in a generic sense; not a set of rituals to observe but a set of values to hold. Though we have an end in sight but are still missing the process for how to get there.\n\nTo take a stab in the dark, I think identity is a critical part. Inside of you there are two wolves. No, sorry\u2026 Inside of you there are multiple identities belonging to different communities, all with different ranges both in literal distance and figurative human connection distance. I would say that my immediate family is one, but then my father\u2019s family and my mother\u2019s family are different but also communities I belong to, and then my home town with some traditions, and then my state, and then my country, and then the Anglophone community, and so on with overlapping or conflicting portions. But if my immediate family prefers beer to wine, I can go most places in the US and get similar beers, and go to a pub in the UK and also get beer there, it looks to me like the communities overlap each other just fine. And in other ways they don\u2019t; I will never understand the British obsession with pies. But I would contrast that experience to sitting down at a Chinese restaurant and seeing a dish in a script I can\u2019t even sound out with the translation of \u201cfried pig colon,\u201d which is a little unsettling, no matter how good that dish may taste.\n\nSo why would that poor Redditor feel like they don\u2019t belong, like this foreign country operated under completely different values, and why was it so alienating to them? The direct answer is stupid: it IS operating under different values, and they feel like they didn\u2019t belong in the community, but importantly they themselves felt this, it wasn\u2019t something forced on them by that community. The community only had to work within its own cultural framework for itself, and when they try to slot themselves in they just don\u2019t fit. I don\u2019t claim it is good or fair, but it is what it is.\n\nSo why do some integrate, and some not? How did my spouse, here with me, transition from depression to happiness? Part of it is always stress, and the energy-sapping ways having to work harder to do mundane things; as we adjusted and learned, everything became easier, and the major hurdles like waiting for residency cards were cleared. But I think a big part of it is being willing to start seeing yourself as part of a different community, and not just learning about it but adjusting yourself to accept it. In the conflict theory view, your disparate communities can only fight for power over your identity, of which there is only so much to go around; assimilation comes when something wins out to create an uneasy peace.\n\nWhy don\u2019t children have as much trouble assimilating as they grow up? I\u2019m sure some feel \u201cout of place,\u201d but I would bet that the even the unhappy child fits in better than an average expat. But children don\u2019t have preconceived, fully-formed identities fresh out of the box, they grow and develop them over time, and when embedded in a culture they usually take up an identity that is compatible with it. But a child should still be suffering under these 1000 cuts, right? They still must learn the culture. But I suspect that for a child, having the identity in place, without competing with another established identity, means that they are just learning and feel at home even if they don\u2019t know everything. For them, there is no identity conflict.\n\n###The Identity Conflict versus a National Identity\n\nWhat does an identity conflict look like? How do these cultural wounds manifest? I\u2019ll focus in on one topic here: food. Everyone eats, normally a few times a day, so it\u2019s inescapable. But at the same time, food is heavily nationally coded; right now I can open up a delivery app and filter restaurants not just by price or distance but by nationality. We talk about \u201ccomfort foods\u201d and \u201cnational dishes.\u201d We reference \u201cabuela\u2019s\u201d or \u201cnonna\u2019s\u201d or \u201coma\u2019s\u201d cooking. I think it\u2019s as good a point as any.\n\nI can walk into a butcher shop in Germany and ask for Rinderrouladen, one of my favorite dishes that my grandmother made consisting of beef slices rolled up with mustard, onion, pickle and bacon; they will correct me that I must have meant the beef slices, I assent, and they produce the requested number of slices from the right cut of beef without me having to explain the details. They will then ask if I want the bacon slices for it too. We both know what Rinderrouladen is, what goes into it, and everything works harmoniously. I can walk into a grocery store and browse at all the different sauerkraut options, then have an old lady come up to me and give me advice as to which brand is best (the store brand, apparently). I can even travel to Dresden to stumble over Eisbein, a pickled ham hock, and find out that it is almost exactly like the Christmas ham we had back home. It\u2019s uncanny, but it\u2019s also unbelievably comfortable; Germany is constantly reinforcing that I belong, that this is like home, that I will never be left pining for a taste of comfort food.\n\nOne of my colleagues is Muslim, not Turkish but from the MENA region, and at least moderately devout, including eating halal food. They are perfectly nice, but the differences in food culture were obvious during a work trip. For one, they couldn\u2019t eat anything all day because of Ramadan. Then, I was surprised to find how restrictive the situation can be; not only can they not eat any pork, but they couldn\u2019t eat other meat because it wasn\u2019t killed in the required fashion; their sad story was of eating pizza four days a week on the work campus because that was the only vegetarian option. And they naturally gravitated towards places that served food like theirs from their home, staffed by people who spoke Arabic like them and kept food halal like they required. They talked about how things were in their home country and how much easier dealing with the restrictions were, for example if everyone is fasting during Ramadan it\u2019s a shared trial and the culture adapts to it. This seems to be a common experience, that\u2019s clear just by reading the experience of many Turks in Germany, [e.g.] (https://web.archive.org/web/20220120145344/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/world/europe/25turkish.html) where the first sentence about Turks retiring in Germany reads, \u201cThe last cups of Turkish black tea had been drained, the platters of olives and goat cheese cleared, but the snowy-haired Turks lingered at the table.\u201d Or read about the proliferation of the doner kebab! Food is a critical part of national identity.\n\nAs another easily-visible point of difference, many, but not all, of these food differences stem from religious differences, but even in a country with freedom of religion and nominal secularization, Germany remains a religious-ish country. The holidays are mainly based on [Christian holidays] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Germany#List_by_state), and depend on each state, including each state\u2019s primary denomination. In a country with church bells commonly ringing despite the \u201cquiet hours\u201d laws, German are not as comfortable with the [Muslim muezzin, the call to prayer] (https://rmx.news/article/majority-of-germans-rejects-muslim-call-to-prayer-poll/). I went hiking in the Bavarian alps over the summer, and there every hilltop has a cross or small chapel on it. I am unsure what my colleague thinks of all this, but it\u2019s easy for me to see how the undercurrents of religion in a nominally secularized country could cause conflict.\n\nThis colleague is going through the normal naturalization process now. They are taking an integration course, and learning the language. By the quantifiable measurements, they were working harder to integrate than I was. But every time we dealt with anything culturally German, they treated it as strange and foreign, while for me it was normal and comforting. The conflict was not over lack of knowledge, but about lack of internal motivation or identification. And although the integration course might be able to make them speak some German and learn about Germany\u2019s cultural values, I don\u2019t think it can automatically change someone\u2019s internal identity. I can\u2019t peer into their mind, but my colleague might always be from their home country, in their hearts, and no matter how much knowledge of German culture they pick up may treat it as a password to get what they want.\n\nIn Catholicism, I have heard the sacraments (baptism, communion, marriage, etc.) called \u201can outward sign of inward grace.\u201d The physical act of the ritual does not itself bestow grace, but brings it to fruition. I think citizenship is a little like that: a legal declaration of a cultural fact. And while God may be infallible and omniscient, we humans are stuck in the world of, at best, Bayesian inference. Gaining citizenship says that we hope the new cultural identity will win the struggle inside your mind, that by virtue of being physically present in Germany, speaking enough German and knowing the German values, the German identity will overcome any other, or at least come to a peaceful sharing of identity; the certificate at the end is just a marker of something we hope went on inside your head.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t go through any integration course, or have to speak any German, or anything like that. Germany didn\u2019t have to give out citizenship to people in my situation. It has been that way for about 50 years at the youngest for those born in wedlock, and working fine. Why change it? Why take someone like me whose grandparent came from Germany, and give them citizenship? Besides the simplistic answer that some powerful lobbying group got it changed, I think there is a deeper reason why Germany would be willing to make that bet, that the German cultural identity could win out.\n\n###Retvrn to Heimat\n\nMy absolute favorite German word is Heimat, which means \u201chomeland\u201d maybe. [It\u2019s more than that, though] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimat). The Heimat is not just where one is from, but denotes a more significant cultural homeland. I like to make it a -hood word: the neighborhood might be the local people around you, while the nationhood is for everyone in your country or statehood for the state, the Heimat is the cultural home-hood or people-hood, the place where you belong; imagine the phrase \u201cit\u2019s not a house but a home\u201d applied to a society. Germany is not \u201cthe nation my grandparent came from,\u201d or \u201cthe nation I live in,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cthe home nation.\u201d\n\nThe Heimat has some important qualities that make it so powerful. Let me paint in broad strokes here. The Heimat is less physical than temporal and cultural. The Heimat has qualities of timelessness, both in that it can never truly be reached and that it is always changing (I could return to my childhood home, but it will never be the same as when I was a child), but yet it always contains those essential homely elements. It covers that essential need of belonging to a society, ensuring that you are valued and appreciated. It is more rural than urban, more social than physical and more cultural than economic, but overlaps both. I would strongly associate words like idyllic or bucolic with the Heimat and less pure happiness.\n\nThe Heimat is, I think, incredibly resistant to quantification, but still vulnerable to it. I am reminded of [Seeing like a State] (https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/), where the state apparatuses have the power to disrupt the natural, organic processes that have served so well but fail to see why these processes work for the societies that created them. Then the state moves in and destroys what was valuable to those who lived in it in an effort to create value that it can see and tax. I would contrast the Rust Belt to the strong German manufacturing base, as destroyed versus preserved identities.\n\nMy colleague\u2019s Heimat is not Germany, and it probably never will be; they grew up in a different country and have a strong sense of belonging to that country. This is not inherently bad and doesn\u2019t make them a \u201cbad immigrant,\u201d and perhaps their children or grandchildren will grow up in Germany and see things differently. But they aren\u2019t participating in the same culture that most other Germans are, even if they can get around as a permanent outsider. They may, [like so many people] (https://web.archive.org/web/20211127185402/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/reader-center/german-identity.html), never feel like they fit in.\n\nWhy did Germany take the bet on me? I think the concept of the Heimat sheds some light there: Germany was betting that it was my Heimat. That this anchor would let me accept the German identity and thrive in it. That, however tenuous my connection, it would be enough to make it stick. That I would be in my home here. Germany is the one and only ancestral Heimat I get, even if I grew up in the US. When I told my father that I had the certificate, the story he relayed to me was about when his mother was on her deathbed and they were arguing about something political, and he said that he was an American citizen, and she told him no, that he was a German. You just can\u2019t conjure up that connection based on economic principles or a preferred lifestyle. It\u2019s not random, I didn\u2019t weigh the pros and cons of being French vs. German, it just always was.\n\nAnd critically, Germany will always be the Heimat. Someone who came here for a better-paying job might leave if the economy falters. Someone who came because they appreciate the German stereotypes of punctuality or organization would run after dealing with the Deutsche Bahn\u2019s chronic train delays or after the first six-month wait to hear anything from the Foreigner\u2019s Authority. Someone who came for politics might find that the political winds change, and what then? I think it\u2019s entirely related to Germany discouraging dual nationality, such as in naturalization. No one can serve two masters it seems. But I\u2019m stuck with it, as are most Germans, and that commitment adds value.\nFinally, I feel that I should give another point of view of the Heimat, one that claims the concept of Heimat is [inherently exclusionary] (https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153953/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/books/max-czollek-germany-desintegriert-euch.html//). I would say that the concept requires some exclusion; I don\u2019t think it would be possible for people to share all possible values with everyone, as some are in conflict with each other, but a core part of the conflict will also come from a conflict of identities in my view.\n\nThe point of Germany being the Heimat isn\u2019t that I naturally came in knowing everything. I knew a little, but there was a huge breadth of culture that I had to adapt to even beyond learning the language. But because I already had some seed of the right identity, there was no conflict; I didn\u2019t have to build up a new identity or destroy my old one, I only had to learn, like a child. So, although I still had to do the work, I haven\u2019t felt the sense as much of \u201cnot belonging\u201d or feeling too much like an outsider; it is a thing to learn not an obstacle to overcome.\n\n###Closeout\n\nI hope that was enjoyable for everyone. I am just one little opinion awash in a sea of them, but I think my path to citizenship was also a bit unique. The StAG \u00a7 5 declaration is pretty new still but was a path to citizenship that was very unexpected for me; it felt like being handed a winning lottery ticket, something I didn\u2019t necessarily deserve, but it still feels right now that it\u2019s complete. I don\u2019t speak much German, but I comfort myself in knowing that I speak more than most Germans did when they became citizens, and look forward to learning more. And for anyone else with recent German ancestry looking to do the same, the law is only available for the next 9 years.\n\nAs far as citizenship vs. identity goes, I stick to my thesis that citizenship is a hopeful claim by the government that you have implanted the right identity into your head to truly assimilate into that culture. And I think Germany is an interesting nation and culture to examine as it has a very different history of immigration compared to e.g. the US, UK or France. More broadly, the ideas of identity and belonging could be applied to other communities.\n\nI have tried to avoid culture warring in this post, but I know immigration is a CW hot-topic. I would prefer to focus this post on the more general topics of identity and citizenship, but I would be happy to talk about CW-related stuff in the culture war roundup thread. But here I'd love to hear from others, especially Germans and their perspectives or from other countries, and those who have also moved and dealt with issues of identity and citizenship.", "author_fullname": "t2_2it1e4th", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Reflection on Becaming a German Citizen", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_x2hhw1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 51, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 51, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661962199.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello fellow Mottizans, I have emerged from my lurker cave to share good news with you all: I have become a German citizen! But not through naturalization or birth; I used an uncommon route with a new and somewhat strange process: a StAG section (\u00a7) 5 declaration. While going through this, I had learned a lot about that citizenship laws of Germany and some comparisons with other countries, as well as spending (too much) time browsing various expat and citizenship forums and subreddits. I\u2019d like to &lt;del&gt;subject you to&lt;/del&gt; share with you what I\u2019ve learned in this weird journey, through intergenerational citizenship and questions of national identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With so many immigrants out there, why should you listen to me, an American moving between western countries? Well, I, personally, value it more when people put in effort for something with less assured payoff; few want to split lottery tickets, everyone wants to split the winnings. Similarly, I moved to Germany as someone with only German heritage, as a normal immigrant, and then more than a year after that a new law offered me a privileged path to citizenship through legal magic. In short, I committed to Germany and then received the winning lottery ticket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bit more about my path: I moved to Germany in 2020 with the &lt;a href=\"https://www.bamf.de/EN/Themen/MigrationAufenthalt/ZuwandererDrittstaaten/Migrathek/BlaueKarteEU/blauekarteeu-node.html\"&gt;EU Blue Card&lt;/a&gt; for highly qualified immigrants. I chose Germany because part of my family was from Germany, and in the typical American style I considered myself German-American. I had visited Germany and liked it, although I knew visiting and living somewhere are two very different things. But what I would really like to stress is that visiting Germany felt like visiting a home, a place that felt natural. I\u2019ve visited plenty of other countries, and everywhere else it was clear that they were foreign, \u201calien\u201d countries. It was obvious when I was in Japan that no matter how much I might like visiting castles or eating ramen, Japan would remain a foreign country. When it was unclear whether I would be still working in Germany, a friend suggested that I work with them in the Netherlands, and a big hangup was that the Netherlands was a foreign country, this despite the fact that they speak more English and I would be around more English-speaking expats. Germany was the ancestral homeland, and no other country could ever replace that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;German citizenship is based primarily on &lt;em&gt;jus sanguinis&lt;/em&gt;, citizenship by blood: someone is a German citizen at birth because their parents were citizens. But this was, in the past, primarily patrilineal. In fact, the German citizenship in my family was cut off when my German grandmother married a foreigner: she automatically lost her German citizenship, rendering her stateless and all her children non-Germans, including my father, and all of her grandchildren were not German either, including me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In August 2021 Germany passed an amendment to the Staatsangeh\u00f6rigkeitsgesetz (StAG), or nationality law. The new StAG \u00a7 5 allows those who, to quote the federal authority, \u201cwere previously excluded by gender-discriminatory regulations from acquiring German citizenship at birth may now acquire it by &lt;a href=\"https://www.bva.bund.de/EN/Services/Citizens/ID-Documents-Law/Citizenship/4_StAG/german_citizenship_law.html\"&gt;way of declaration.&lt;/a&gt; Briefly, the post-war German Basic Law (a constitution) forbids gender discrimination, and so those who were excluded from acquiring citizenship due to this gender discrimination could &lt;a href=\"https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stag/englisch_stag.html\"&gt;claim it back&lt;/a&gt;; for example, until 1975, German women would not pass down citizenship by default. The process is new enough that the relevant authority here in Germany, in a major city, did not know about it. But I collected all of our old documents, submitted my application, and now (as of the time of writing) the certificate is in the mail in hand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did it, I became a German citizen! I did not naturalize, I gained citizenship through declaration (queue up, \u201cI didn\u2019t say citizenship, I declared it!\u201d). I did not have to reside in Germany for 6-8 years, I did not have to speak German, pass any test, pay any money or do anything at all but submit a few documents and citizenship was handed down in a puff of magical legal smoke by a bureaucrat I\u2019ve never met before. If I suffered some brain damage I could commit terrorism or racially motivated crimes, things that would have excluded me before, and still keep the citizenship (I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll test that though). And my children will also be German citizens from birth, and their children, and so on forever, just as it had been passed down to me from forever ago (well, at least since 1871).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But importantly, I haven\u2019t been saying that I became German. I don\u2019t speak German, I didn\u2019t grow up in Germany, and neither did my parents. By the Basic Law, I am a German because I hold German citizenship, but I try to look past the purely legal standing. I don\u2019t think the idea of who is German has a really clear and universal answer; different people and different Germans give different answers. Perhaps we can talk about the traits of Germans, but until we have access to the pure and perfect German Form, arguments are really all we can get. I will reference that concept of being a German plenty though, and the legal vs. cultural German.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gives my background and stake in the matter, and it will make for a nice dinner party story but isn\u2019t that important. In fact, nothing really changes legally for me anyway, my permit covered it all before. I think it\u2019s much more interesting to talk about what I\u2019ve learned along the way, as it might actually be interesting and useful for everyone else. So here it goes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Strangeness of Descent Laws&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;German citizenship by descent is a mess, but it\u2019s interesting to take a little dip into the law. Before I only said that German citizenship is based on descent, which glosses over many of the complications that arise in tracing that path. A nice guide on the process can be found &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/citizenship\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The US (and most countries in the Americas) use primarily jus soli or birthright citizenship, i.e. you are a citizen of a country if you are born in that country, but also has &lt;a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Acquisition-US-Citizenship-Child-Born-Abroad.html\"&gt;citizenship by descent&lt;/a&gt;. But it\u2019s much more restrictive; in particular, while German citizenship by descent is basically limitless, US citizenship by descent requires that if e.g. the child has two citizen parents, at least one resided in the US at any point, or if only one parent is a US citizen they must have resided in the US for at least five years. I call this a \u201csunset clause\u201d in citizenship, something that terminates citizenship automatically without a connection to the home country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without a solid sunset clause in the German citizenship by descent, you get some (in my personal view) strange lines of descent. Someone whose great-great-great-grandfather left Germany in the late 1800s can be a German citizen directly if it happens to pass only through the male line in key years. Compare this to someone whose German mother married a foreigner and they were born in 1948; their path to citizenship would be under StAG \u00a714, and they have to establish a close connection to Germany, such as speaking German and having close family members in Germany. Here we see that you can only be a legal German if you establish that you are already a cultural German. Add on to this complications such as if your parents naturalized before or after you were born, if you served in a foreign military, if you every voluntarily gained citizenship of another country, and it gets complicated. To note, Germany has added a sunset clause: if a German citizen is born abroad after 1999, any of their children born abroad only retain German citizenship if the authorities are notified before the &lt;a href=\"https://www.germany.info/us-en/service/03-Citizenship/german-citizenship-acquired-through-notification-of-birth-occuring-abroad/943378\"&gt;child\u2019s first birthday&lt;/a&gt;. No more surprise citizenships by descent a hundred years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this has led to a lot of people sorting through old paperwork to find out if they are secretly German citizens or can become one. I like to point to the growth of &lt;a href=\"/r/GermanCitizenship\"&gt;r/GermanCitizenship&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"https://subredditstats.com/r/germancitizenship\"&gt;part of it&lt;/a&gt;, but the perhaps better known example is for Italy, where it is popular enough to have consular wait times in years and a &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220621175345/https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-citizenship-007-documents-francesco-curione/index.html\"&gt;CNN article about it&lt;/a&gt;. I\u2019ll just voice my personal opinion that all of this is a little strange to me; when one out of sixteen or thirty-two of your ancestors at a particular level came from a particular country, it\u2019s hard for me to see where exactly your connection comes in. The legal case may be perfectly fine, but the cultural part falls through. I normally see it chalked up to \u201chonoring ancestors\u201d or \u201ckeeping their memory alive,\u201d which turns into an excuse to have a nice passport and travel the EU visa-free as far as I\u2019ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I should mention that Germany, in principle, discourages dual citizenship. If you naturalize, you normally must give up other citizenships, if it is possible and doesn\u2019t cause undue hardship. Notably, the fees to renounce US citizenship are high enough that the authorities may permit you to keep US citizenship if you make less per month than the fees, $2,350. It also permits dual citizenship if other citizenships were gained automatically, i.e. from birthright. There are many exceptions nowadays, but the principle still exists, and causes problems sometimes when e.g. people are forced to &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210220071357/https:/www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/world/europe/16iht-letter16.html\"&gt;choose a nationality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I will point out that StAG \u00a75 vs. \u00a714 (post- vs. pre- Basic Law) seems weird to me. A German woman could lose her citizenship by marrying a foreigner in e.g. 1947, have a child in 1948 then one in 1950; the first would have to prove their ties to Germany, while the second would get in without any restrictions, but in both cases the relevant legal situation that caused the loss of citizenship is the same and only stopped in 1950(ish). For the second child, the claim would be that because the Basic Law forbids gender discrimination, they were unfairly discriminated because they should have been able to obtain citizenship from a female parent. I\u2019m not a jurist but the legal idea seems fraught: how could laws prohibiting an action in the future justify retroactive corrections? But \u00a75 covers much more than that, affecting people born as late as 1993.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the biggest takeaway from all of this is that I have the impression that citizenship laws oftentimes are capricious and arbitrary, relying on old documents that some may or may not have and offering various paths or restrictions that change over time. Countries try to both preserve a legal basis for citizenship while trying to reasonably restrict it, while working under changing social views and massive changes in the way the world works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think a look at the citizenship laws is helpful mostly to find out that they don\u2019t really answer anything but a legal question, which is important but not what I\u2019m after. I hope no one thinks that someone born to a German mother and a foreign father in 1974 is definitely not a citizen while a sibling born in 1976 definitely is, even if the legal situation is clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Reddit Expatriation Community&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s enough about citizenship laws then. I was fascinated by (potential) immigrants, especially on Reddit, that I came across in my browsing. As an American, I grew up with the idea that America was the land of immigration and that immigration only really flowed one-way. I think the statistics bears this out, with the US having one of the lowest shares of its &lt;a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/4237/the-countries-with-the-most-people-living-overseas/\"&gt;population living abroad&lt;/a&gt;. Why would someone leave the freest and richest country?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is changing, slowly. As other countries become richer, it becomes less clear that America is the automatic best option, and it is probably easier; I can do things like videocall my parents every week and translate written text on my phone, things that make it vastly easier to emigrate. And let\u2019s be clear, the advantage of being a natural Anglophone is huge. On Reddit, which I think is primarily dominated by Americans and Anglophones in general, some of the migration-focused subreddits have seen a lot of growth: &lt;a href=\"https://subredditstats.com/r/amerexit\"&gt;Amerexit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://subredditstats.com/r/iwantout\"&gt;iwantout&lt;/a&gt;,and &lt;a href=\"https://subredditstats.com/r/expats\"&gt;expats&lt;/a&gt;. Those are my three favorite (or at least most entertaining) subreddits, and they run the gamut from \u201cAmerica sucks, I want to leave!\u201d to \u201cHow can I leave my current country (serious answers only)?\u201d to \u201cLiving in a foreign country sucks in so many ways.\u201d Pick your favorite, I guess. And like in everything else, politics is the mind-poison in immigration. But there are many common themes; I\u2019ll reference posts without linking to avoid inter-subreddit drama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think most of these immigrants, and probably most immigrants in general, are what I would call \u201cmaterialist immigrants.\u201d Most people are looking to improve their economic situation or living standards. How they rate these things is up to them; someone may value high salaries directly, while others value more consistent healthcare coverage or walkable neighborhoods. If they\u2019re from a western country they may consider themselves (and others like them) an &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=expat+vs+immigrant+reddit\"&gt;expat instead of an immigrant&lt;/a&gt;, but it all amounts to the same thing. Even that German citizenship guide I linked before explains the benefits of becoming a German citizen in almost &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/citizenship#wiki_benefits_of_german_citizenship\"&gt;purely economic terms&lt;/a&gt;: live and work in the EU! Travel visa-free in so many places with a German passport! Go to university for free! If you\u2019re destitute, Germany will take care of you! Drawbacks: none, you don\u2019t have to learn German or pay any taxes or do anything at all for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the discussions reflect this living-standard/economic focus, and an entirely Ameri-centric view. Currently in &lt;a href=\"/r/AmerExit\"&gt;r/AmerExit&lt;/a&gt;, someone is hating on the US because\u2026 (checks subreddit) they can find cheap mineral water while on vacation in Italy. No, I\u2019m not joking, it\u2019s the first point in a top post at the time of writing. Someone may fear American politics enough to instead move to Turkey, a country that literally went through an attempted military coup in 2016 and has a nice book review regarding &lt;a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-new-sultan\"&gt;Erdogan-as-dictator on ACX&lt;/a&gt;. Or a contemporary favorite, overlooking the fact that many countries have more strict abortion laws than some US states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When looking for somewhere to go, I see so often that people think of moving to completely different countries, treating them all the same as if \u201cwestern European\u201d covered everything they need. One person might say Germany and\u2026 Wales? How about the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Germany, France or the UK? Another might want to move to Ireland or Scandinavia, but they speak fluent Spanish. Countries are interchangeable, as long as they have some greenery, good weather and everyone there aligns with their values. Everyone is \u201cwilling to learn the language,\u201d a completely costless declaration that I always translate to, \u201cI may learn to swim if you throw me in the middle of the ocean.\u201d Even at the end of the natural process, I can see someone declare that they are finally an \u201cEU citizen\u201d after eight years as if their citizenship was granted by Brussels and not their home country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond the standard internet/Reddit stupidity, these feel like they cover an individualist- and money-focused worldview. And it naturally feeds materialist immigration that disregards the people who actually live in these places, which causes critical problems in adjusting to a life in a foreign country. Remember what I said about &lt;a href=\"/r/expats\"&gt;r/expats&lt;/a&gt;? It\u2019s the opposite version of &lt;a href=\"/r/AmerExit\"&gt;r/AmerExit&lt;/a&gt;, where people have gone to a foreign country and found that, yeah, it\u2019s not America. This is what happens in the culture-clash. The day-to-day reality of living in a country that sees the sun for a few hours a day in the winter sets in. Of dealing with people who will always treat you like a foreigner. Of being far away from family and former friends. It\u2019s tough to live somewhere far away from home, and it\u2019s tough to know that before you actually make the move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But\u2026 why is it tough? I haven\u2019t seen many expats complaining about their jobs, most complain about the people around them and their social life. And the world seems very thoroughly Americanized: I visit American-style department stores, see advertisements in English, I can almost always ask to speak English with people, it all sounds very convenient to and for me. They have the healthcare and sparkling water they so desperately desired. What\u2019s missing? Why can\u2019t they assimilate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Death by 1000 (Cultural) Cuts&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An insightful and heartfelt Reddit comment put the culture-fit problem as something like a multitude of tiny interactions that cause friction for the immigrant and make it clear that they do not \u201cbelong\u201d in that society. In the end, they\u2019re left miserable and desperate for something that brings them comfort and familiarity, a sense of home in a foreign land. That\u2019s hard to quantify, but we can work around it a bit and hopefully get some sense of it. To borrow a little from conflict vs. mistake theory, I see assimilation oftentimes described as a problem to be solved, a set of cultural ideas and language to learn. Germany\u2019s naturalization requirements include B1 German language level and passing a 33-question test. That doesn\u2019t seem like much; a B1 level may be 500 hours total of study, and I see timeframes of months for that. How can a rich American expat fail to integrate anywhere, when the skills they need take just a few months of work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mistake theory view treats assimilation like a set of instructions: cultural problem in, cultural solution out. It treats it like\u2026 well, like a language, you just have to learn it and speak it fluently to fit in. There should be no reason that one cannot assimilate into any and every culture, you only need to learn the cultural framework to give the right answers at the right time. I\u2019d even say it treats it like a &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room\"&gt;Chinese room&lt;/a&gt; of culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the Chinese room substitutes external verification for internal motivation. Yeah, you can answer me these questions (thirty) three, but does that mean you understand them? Do you care about them? Even then, does it really make you a citizen? Why would a set of multiple-choice questions denote the bright threshold between our ingroup and outgroup, the citizens and the foreigners? To give you an idea of the test, &lt;a href=\"https://www.lebenindeutschland.eu/\"&gt;check here&lt;/a&gt;, it includes such stumpers as \u201cpick out your state\u2019s flag\u201d and \u201cwhat was the war between 1939-1945 called?\u201d. I took the test, despite speaking only minimal German, for a state that I don\u2019t live in and passed with 21/33; it\u2019s just not that hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What might a conflict theory view suggest? Well, one useful element from it is that the direction of movement is what matters; things never stay the same, conflict is pervasive over scarce resources. Then the struggle is not a matter of fact to be decided with a solution at the end, but a struggle of power. While conflict theory is based on conflict between social groups, I would apply it here to the internal conflict of assimilation: the immigrant, to adjust, does not need just to learn the language and culture but must internalize the \u201cculture\u201d in a generic sense; not a set of rituals to observe but a set of values to hold. Though we have an end in sight but are still missing the process for how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To take a stab in the dark, I think identity is a critical part. Inside of you there are two wolves. No, sorry\u2026 Inside of you there are multiple identities belonging to different communities, all with different ranges both in literal distance and figurative human connection distance. I would say that my immediate family is one, but then my father\u2019s family and my mother\u2019s family are different but also communities I belong to, and then my home town with some traditions, and then my state, and then my country, and then the Anglophone community, and so on with overlapping or conflicting portions. But if my immediate family prefers beer to wine, I can go most places in the US and get similar beers, and go to a pub in the UK and also get beer there, it looks to me like the communities overlap each other just fine. And in other ways they don\u2019t; I will never understand the British obsession with pies. But I would contrast that experience to sitting down at a Chinese restaurant and seeing a dish in a script I can\u2019t even sound out with the translation of \u201cfried pig colon,\u201d which is a little unsettling, no matter how good that dish may taste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why would that poor Redditor feel like they don\u2019t belong, like this foreign country operated under completely different values, and why was it so alienating to them? The direct answer is stupid: it IS operating under different values, and they feel like they didn\u2019t belong in the community, but importantly they themselves felt this, it wasn\u2019t something forced on them by that community. The community only had to work within its own cultural framework for itself, and when they try to slot themselves in they just don\u2019t fit. I don\u2019t claim it is good or fair, but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why do some integrate, and some not? How did my spouse, here with me, transition from depression to happiness? Part of it is always stress, and the energy-sapping ways having to work harder to do mundane things; as we adjusted and learned, everything became easier, and the major hurdles like waiting for residency cards were cleared. But I think a big part of it is being willing to start seeing yourself as part of a different community, and not just learning about it but adjusting yourself to accept it. In the conflict theory view, your disparate communities can only fight for power over your identity, of which there is only so much to go around; assimilation comes when something wins out to create an uneasy peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why don\u2019t children have as much trouble assimilating as they grow up? I\u2019m sure some feel \u201cout of place,\u201d but I would bet that the even the unhappy child fits in better than an average expat. But children don\u2019t have preconceived, fully-formed identities fresh out of the box, they grow and develop them over time, and when embedded in a culture they usually take up an identity that is compatible with it. But a child should still be suffering under these 1000 cuts, right? They still must learn the culture. But I suspect that for a child, having the identity in place, without competing with another established identity, means that they are just learning and feel at home even if they don\u2019t know everything. For them, there is no identity conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Identity Conflict versus a National Identity&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does an identity conflict look like? How do these cultural wounds manifest? I\u2019ll focus in on one topic here: food. Everyone eats, normally a few times a day, so it\u2019s inescapable. But at the same time, food is heavily nationally coded; right now I can open up a delivery app and filter restaurants not just by price or distance but by nationality. We talk about \u201ccomfort foods\u201d and \u201cnational dishes.\u201d We reference \u201cabuela\u2019s\u201d or \u201cnonna\u2019s\u201d or \u201coma\u2019s\u201d cooking. I think it\u2019s as good a point as any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can walk into a butcher shop in Germany and ask for Rinderrouladen, one of my favorite dishes that my grandmother made consisting of beef slices rolled up with mustard, onion, pickle and bacon; they will correct me that I must have meant the beef slices, I assent, and they produce the requested number of slices from the right cut of beef without me having to explain the details. They will then ask if I want the bacon slices for it too. We both know what Rinderrouladen is, what goes into it, and everything works harmoniously. I can walk into a grocery store and browse at all the different sauerkraut options, then have an old lady come up to me and give me advice as to which brand is best (the store brand, apparently). I can even travel to Dresden to stumble over Eisbein, a pickled ham hock, and find out that it is almost exactly like the Christmas ham we had back home. It\u2019s uncanny, but it\u2019s also unbelievably comfortable; Germany is constantly reinforcing that I belong, that this is like home, that I will never be left pining for a taste of comfort food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my colleagues is Muslim, not Turkish but from the MENA region, and at least moderately devout, including eating halal food. They are perfectly nice, but the differences in food culture were obvious during a work trip. For one, they couldn\u2019t eat anything all day because of Ramadan. Then, I was surprised to find how restrictive the situation can be; not only can they not eat any pork, but they couldn\u2019t eat other meat because it wasn\u2019t killed in the required fashion; their sad story was of eating pizza four days a week on the work campus because that was the only vegetarian option. And they naturally gravitated towards places that served food like theirs from their home, staffed by people who spoke Arabic like them and kept food halal like they required. They talked about how things were in their home country and how much easier dealing with the restrictions were, for example if everyone is fasting during Ramadan it\u2019s a shared trial and the culture adapts to it. This seems to be a common experience, that\u2019s clear just by reading the experience of many Turks in Germany, &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220120145344/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/world/europe/25turkish.html\"&gt;e.g.&lt;/a&gt; where the first sentence about Turks retiring in Germany reads, \u201cThe last cups of Turkish black tea had been drained, the platters of olives and goat cheese cleared, but the snowy-haired Turks lingered at the table.\u201d Or read about the proliferation of the doner kebab! Food is a critical part of national identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As another easily-visible point of difference, many, but not all, of these food differences stem from religious differences, but even in a country with freedom of religion and nominal secularization, Germany remains a religious-ish country. The holidays are mainly based on &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Germany#List_by_state\"&gt;Christian holidays&lt;/a&gt;, and depend on each state, including each state\u2019s primary denomination. In a country with church bells commonly ringing despite the \u201cquiet hours\u201d laws, German are not as comfortable with the &lt;a href=\"https://rmx.news/article/majority-of-germans-rejects-muslim-call-to-prayer-poll/\"&gt;Muslim muezzin, the call to prayer&lt;/a&gt;. I went hiking in the Bavarian alps over the summer, and there every hilltop has a cross or small chapel on it. I am unsure what my colleague thinks of all this, but it\u2019s easy for me to see how the undercurrents of religion in a nominally secularized country could cause conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This colleague is going through the normal naturalization process now. They are taking an integration course, and learning the language. By the quantifiable measurements, they were working harder to integrate than I was. But every time we dealt with anything culturally German, they treated it as strange and foreign, while for me it was normal and comforting. The conflict was not over lack of knowledge, but about lack of internal motivation or identification. And although the integration course might be able to make them speak some German and learn about Germany\u2019s cultural values, I don\u2019t think it can automatically change someone\u2019s internal identity. I can\u2019t peer into their mind, but my colleague might always be from their home country, in their hearts, and no matter how much knowledge of German culture they pick up may treat it as a password to get what they want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Catholicism, I have heard the sacraments (baptism, communion, marriage, etc.) called \u201can outward sign of inward grace.\u201d The physical act of the ritual does not itself bestow grace, but brings it to fruition. I think citizenship is a little like that: a legal declaration of a cultural fact. And while God may be infallible and omniscient, we humans are stuck in the world of, at best, Bayesian inference. Gaining citizenship says that we hope the new cultural identity will win the struggle inside your mind, that by virtue of being physically present in Germany, speaking enough German and knowing the German values, the German identity will overcome any other, or at least come to a peaceful sharing of identity; the certificate at the end is just a marker of something we hope went on inside your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn\u2019t go through any integration course, or have to speak any German, or anything like that. Germany didn\u2019t have to give out citizenship to people in my situation. It has been that way for about 50 years at the youngest for those born in wedlock, and working fine. Why change it? Why take someone like me whose grandparent came from Germany, and give them citizenship? Besides the simplistic answer that some powerful lobbying group got it changed, I think there is a deeper reason why Germany would be willing to make that bet, that the German cultural identity could win out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Retvrn to Heimat&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My absolute favorite German word is Heimat, which means \u201chomeland\u201d maybe. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimat\"&gt;It\u2019s more than that, though&lt;/a&gt;. The Heimat is not just where one is from, but denotes a more significant cultural homeland. I like to make it a -hood word: the neighborhood might be the local people around you, while the nationhood is for everyone in your country or statehood for the state, the Heimat is the cultural home-hood or people-hood, the place where you belong; imagine the phrase \u201cit\u2019s not a house but a home\u201d applied to a society. Germany is not \u201cthe nation my grandparent came from,\u201d or \u201cthe nation I live in,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cthe home nation.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Heimat has some important qualities that make it so powerful. Let me paint in broad strokes here. The Heimat is less physical than temporal and cultural. The Heimat has qualities of timelessness, both in that it can never truly be reached and that it is always changing (I could return to my childhood home, but it will never be the same as when I was a child), but yet it always contains those essential homely elements. It covers that essential need of belonging to a society, ensuring that you are valued and appreciated. It is more rural than urban, more social than physical and more cultural than economic, but overlaps both. I would strongly associate words like idyllic or bucolic with the Heimat and less pure happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Heimat is, I think, incredibly resistant to quantification, but still vulnerable to it. I am reminded of &lt;a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/\"&gt;Seeing like a State&lt;/a&gt;, where the state apparatuses have the power to disrupt the natural, organic processes that have served so well but fail to see why these processes work for the societies that created them. Then the state moves in and destroys what was valuable to those who lived in it in an effort to create value that it can see and tax. I would contrast the Rust Belt to the strong German manufacturing base, as destroyed versus preserved identities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My colleague\u2019s Heimat is not Germany, and it probably never will be; they grew up in a different country and have a strong sense of belonging to that country. This is not inherently bad and doesn\u2019t make them a \u201cbad immigrant,\u201d and perhaps their children or grandchildren will grow up in Germany and see things differently. But they aren\u2019t participating in the same culture that most other Germans are, even if they can get around as a permanent outsider. They may, &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20211127185402/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/reader-center/german-identity.html\"&gt;like so many people&lt;/a&gt;, never feel like they fit in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did Germany take the bet on me? I think the concept of the Heimat sheds some light there: Germany was betting that it was my Heimat. That this anchor would let me accept the German identity and thrive in it. That, however tenuous my connection, it would be enough to make it stick. That I would be in my home here. Germany is the one and only ancestral Heimat I get, even if I grew up in the US. When I told my father that I had the certificate, the story he relayed to me was about when his mother was on her deathbed and they were arguing about something political, and he said that he was an American citizen, and she told him no, that he was a German. You just can\u2019t conjure up that connection based on economic principles or a preferred lifestyle. It\u2019s not random, I didn\u2019t weigh the pros and cons of being French vs. German, it just always was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And critically, Germany will always be the Heimat. Someone who came here for a better-paying job might leave if the economy falters. Someone who came because they appreciate the German stereotypes of punctuality or organization would run after dealing with the Deutsche Bahn\u2019s chronic train delays or after the first six-month wait to hear anything from the Foreigner\u2019s Authority. Someone who came for politics might find that the political winds change, and what then? I think it\u2019s entirely related to Germany discouraging dual nationality, such as in naturalization. No one can serve two masters it seems. But I\u2019m stuck with it, as are most Germans, and that commitment adds value.\nFinally, I feel that I should give another point of view of the Heimat, one that claims the concept of Heimat is &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210308153953/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/books/max-czollek-germany-desintegriert-euch.html//\"&gt;inherently exclusionary&lt;/a&gt;. I would say that the concept requires some exclusion; I don\u2019t think it would be possible for people to share all possible values with everyone, as some are in conflict with each other, but a core part of the conflict will also come from a conflict of identities in my view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point of Germany being the Heimat isn\u2019t that I naturally came in knowing everything. I knew a little, but there was a huge breadth of culture that I had to adapt to even beyond learning the language. But because I already had some seed of the right identity, there was no conflict; I didn\u2019t have to build up a new identity or destroy my old one, I only had to learn, like a child. So, although I still had to do the work, I haven\u2019t felt the sense as much of \u201cnot belonging\u201d or feeling too much like an outsider; it is a thing to learn not an obstacle to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Closeout&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope that was enjoyable for everyone. I am just one little opinion awash in a sea of them, but I think my path to citizenship was also a bit unique. The StAG \u00a7 5 declaration is pretty new still but was a path to citizenship that was very unexpected for me; it felt like being handed a winning lottery ticket, something I didn\u2019t necessarily deserve, but it still feels right now that it\u2019s complete. I don\u2019t speak much German, but I comfort myself in knowing that I speak more than most Germans did when they became citizens, and look forward to learning more. And for anyone else with recent German ancestry looking to do the same, the law is only available for the next 9 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as citizenship vs. identity goes, I stick to my thesis that citizenship is a hopeful claim by the government that you have implanted the right identity into your head to truly assimilate into that culture. And I think Germany is an interesting nation and culture to examine as it has a very different history of immigration compared to e.g. the US, UK or France. More broadly, the ideas of identity and belonging could be applied to other communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have tried to avoid culture warring in this post, but I know immigration is a CW hot-topic. I would prefer to focus this post on the more general topics of identity and citizenship, but I would be happy to talk about CW-related stuff in the culture war roundup thread. But here I&amp;#39;d love to hear from others, especially Germans and their perspectives or from other countries, and those who have also moved and dealt with issues of identity and citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.

I gave at [ESPR](https://espr-camp.org/), in preparation for a Fermithon, i.e., a Fermi estimates tournament.*\n\nFermi estimation is a method for arriving an estimate of an uncertain variable of interest. Given a variable of interest, sometimes you can decompose it into steps, and multiplying those steps together gives you a more accurate estimate than estimating the thing you want to know directly. I'll go through a proof sketch for this at the end of the post.\n\nIf you want to take over the world, why should you care about this? Well, you may care about this if you hope that having better models of the world would lead you to make better decisions, and to better achieve your goals. And Fermi estimates are one way of training or showing off the skill of building models of the world. They have fast feedback loops, because you can in many cases then check the answer on the internet afterwards. But they are probably most useful in cases where you can't.\n\nThe rest of the class was a trial by fire: I presented some questions, students gave their own estimates, and then briefly discussed them. In case you want to give it a try before seeing the answers, the questions I considered were:\n\n1. How many people have covid in the UK right now (2022-08-20)?\n2. How many cumulative person years did people live in/under the Soviet Union?\n3. How many intelligent species does the universe hold outside of Earth?\n4. Are any staff members dating?\n5. How many \"state-based conflicts\" are going on right now? (\"state based conflict\" = at least one party is a state, at least 25 deaths a year, massacres and genocides not included)\n6. How much does ESPR (a summer camp) cost?\n7. How many people are members of the Chinese communist party?\n8. What is the US defense budget?\n9. How many daily viewers does Tucker Carlson have?\n\nThe rest of the post is [here](https://nunosempere.com/blog/2022/08/20/fermi-introduction/).

https://old.reddit.com/r/theschism/comments/vz1r1l/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_4/)\n\n##Chapter 5\n\nMy apologies for the delay, this chapter was just so boring in comparison to all the interesting historiography Gottfried did in the previous chapters. But it\u2019s worthwhile as a topic, so here we go.\n\nGottfried starts by explaining the desire in the 1930s by people like Oswald Mosley to create some kind of pan-European unity on the right. They weren\u2019t uniform in their promotion of fascism, but they didn\u2019t see fascism as needing to be done by each country independently. As Gottfried writes it, there was a hope that \u201cThey [fascist countries] could all cooperate in building a new European order and, in the near term, opposing the threat represented by international bolshevism.\u201d\n\nWe now get a lengthy examination of fascist fiction as proof of this hope, starting with the novel *Gilles*, published in 1939 by Pierre Drieu La Rochelle.\n\nAt one point in the novel, the protagonist ends up on a boat with a Pole and an Irishman. When the latter two are asked about why they are fascists, they claim to support the Catholic Church and look to combine \u201cthe ancient with the modern. There\u2019s more debate and discussion about questions like \u201cwhat if the Church doesn\u2019t support fascism or promotes anti-fascism?\u201d and \u201cwhat if Poland tried to ally with the Soviet Union to stop a German invasion?\u201d The answers show that both men are not tied to their countries, but to the promotion of some fascist world order which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean one country rules all. They view rule by democracies as bad as being ruled by the Soviets. The protagonist laments Germany\u2019s \u201cdefective fascism\u201d, hoping it will see the light and vow to honor other European nations\u2019 territory to defeat the Red Menace.\n\nThis protagonist is a reflection of the author\u2019s own views, as one might expect. He\u2019s an admirer of the Frenchman Charles Maurras (who also hated Jews, Americans, and Marxists). He hates France\u2019s Third Republic to the point of supporting the Marxists in their desire to destroy it. He views himself as a supporter of \u201cLatin civilization\u201d over any particular nation, but also doesn\u2019t espouse any particular Catholic dogma.\n\nThere was, however, a tension between this kind of neo-pagan fascist and the clerical fascists. In Austria, conservative Catholics attacked a fascist internationalist journal for supporting neo-pagan doctrines. The journal tried to forestall this by emphasizing Mussolini\u2019s revulsion of Protestantism, and generally tried to tie the Church to fascism (they did, however, highlight the subordination of Catholic beliefs to concepts like Latinity).\n\n###Italian Efforts for International Fascism\n\nGiven that international fascism as depicted thus far draws heavily to supporting Italy, it\u2019s not a surprise that it had widespread support from Italian fascist politicians. Government sponsored groups and publications put forth this idea that fascism had clear international significance. \n\nHistorian Beate Scholz suggests this was all window dressing for consolidating Mussolini\u2019s own rule. As for Gottfried, he says a cynical perspective could conclude that Mussolini supported internationalism up to the moment it was no longer useful. After the invasion of Ethiopia and the alliance with Nazi Germany, he appealed to strict national interest and some racist ideology.\n\nIf we\u2019re willing to be more charitable, Mussolini actually engaged in tremendous support for internationalism. Il Duce himself noted the ties between the Roman Catholic Church and international fascism, for that matter. The Catholics, for their part, viewed the Italians as a political and moral arm of the Counter-Reformation. Asvero Gravelli, one who saw himself as \u201cthe architect of fascist internationalism\u201d, claimed that a giant battle would take place between East and West where the fascists would be the only ones to prevail in the name of Christ and against foreign forces. \n\n###Oswald Mosely\n\nThe biggest worker for the cause of international fascism was not Italian or even a Latin fascist, but apparently an English aristocrat named Oswald Mosely. He was an \u201cauthoritarian modernizer\u201d in the 1920s and 1930s and thoroughly determined to avoid a second European bloodbath. He went through several British political parties before creating his own fascist one.\n\nThe man wasn\u2019t just on the hook of Italy, multiple English aristocrats supported him in one way or another, though he also lost friends over his devotion to the fascist cause. His idea was simple: the Soviet experiment would only harm Britain if tried here, and parliamentary governments could not provide the decisive leadership needed. He courted Nazi Germany but wasn\u2019t so focused on identifying Jews as the enemy in Britain.\n\nOver that last point, he and his wife were claimed to be Nazi agents and imprisoned from 1940 to 1943, despite there being no evidence he ever received Nazi funds. After the war, one of his biographers claims he was highly active in continuing to push for European unity (now described as one nation), but this was not going to work when there was a much more powerful unity in the emerging European Community that was backed by the United States. Also, his programs were being offered by socialists, who weren\u2019t tainted by being on the right.\n\nDespite this picture of a man with tremendous energy, Oswald would die more or less a social outcast in 1980.\n\nIn a way, Mosely\u2019s fate matches that of fascism. He did well in the interwar period but nowhere else, and had his success rooted in Continental Europe. It didn\u2019t happen, of course. The BUF (Mosely\u2019s fascist party) did very poorly in the British elections and thoroughly lost to Labour. And in the post-WW2 era, all fascists carried the association of Nazism. \n\nBut what if they didn\u2019t carry that stigma? Would they have done better? Probably not, their economic programs weren\u2019t different enough from other parties, and their point of difference was a warning about Third World immigration, but that was a lost cause.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of whether fascism could ever be international in nature. Gottfried argues no, as while communism was universal at its core and that universalism was central to how the Bolsheviks built their government in the Soviet Union, fascist governments always saw internationalism as a secondary concern. Indeed, by the time the remaining fascist movements in Europe post-WW2 even got around to pledging to assist each other in making a fascist Europe, it was 1961 and the time had long since passed.\n\nTo summarize this chapter further:\n\n**Fascism had people who were dedicated to making an international export of it, but its movements were primarily focused on their own nations and didn\u2019t care that much about making a fascist international community. After WW2, they fell to the wayside as increasingly irrelevant and unable to escape the association with the Nazis.**\n\nI hope you enjoyed!

Also, his programs were being offered by socialists, who weren\u2019t tainted by being on the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite this picture of a man with tremendous energy, Oswald would die more or less a social outcast in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a way, Mosely\u2019s fate matches that of fascism. He did well in the interwar period but nowhere else, and had his success rooted in Continental Europe. It didn\u2019t happen, of course. The BUF (Mosely\u2019s fascist party) did very poorly in the British elections and thoroughly lost to Labour. And in the post-WW2 era, all fascists carried the association of Nazism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what if they didn\u2019t carry that stigma? Would they have done better? Probably not, their economic programs weren\u2019t different enough from other parties, and their point of difference was a warning about Third World immigration, but that was a lost cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there\u2019s the question of whether fascism could ever be international in nature. Gottfried argues no, as while communism was universal at its core and that universalism was central to how the Bolsheviks built their government in the Soviet Union, fascist governments always saw internationalism as a secondary concern. Indeed, by the time the remaining fascist movements in Europe post-WW2 even got around to pledging to assist each other in making a fascist Europe, it was 1961 and the time had long since passed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To summarize this chapter further:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fascism had people who were dedicated to making an international export of it, but its movements were primarily focused on their own nations and didn\u2019t care that much about making a fascist international community. After WW2, they fell to the wayside as increasingly irrelevant and unable to escape the association with the Nazis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed!

I usually do not make a note of it, but particularly in a piece like this in which I express deep gratitude for the LDS people in my life I want to emphasize that I use the shorthand out of longstanding personal appreciation for and familiarity with the term, not with intent to dismiss their faith or preferences.*)\n\nTo my surprise, my wedding day was the best day of my life.\n\nYes, yes, I know that's how people always said weddings were supposed to be. But I've never been much of one for big events, for ceremonies, for pomp and circumstance. While I've never been persuaded by messaging like [this](https://twitter.com/CountMoriarty/status/1560703561843056640), it's been a big part of the water in which I swim:\n\n&gt; Better option is not to have weddings at all and invite no one. Why pay tens of thousands of pounds for a single day when the marriage probably won't last and you won't see half of the relatives again. I can't think of a worse waste of money and time.\n\nSo much cost, so much fuss, so much demand for people to fly out and set time aside and dress up. The notion of an event inspired more tension than excitement for me, and my husband-to-be would just as soon have wandered into a courthouse one Saturday and called it a day. But I felt a sense of duty and one of ritual importance to bring friends and family together for a core moment in my life, particularly since I've been something of a nomad throughout my adulthood. I'm a latecomer to this sort of appreciation of tradition and ritual, at times willing to occupy forms without fully feeling the value of them. So I gritted my teeth and elected to prepare a traditional wedding over my own trepidation and the shrugs of the man I love\u2014or at least as traditional a wedding as is possible when one leaves the faith and culture of his ancestors and marries not the Mormon-woman-in-a-temple he had always been taught to plan for, but a man he stumbled across on a dating app.\n\nIt was an unusual event, but a joyous one\u2014not only for the chance to call the man I love my husband, but for the many friends and family members from various corners of my life who showed up to offer their support and love. I have lived an unusually fragmented life\u2014my childhood in Utah, my Mormon mission in Australia, my jumping from place to place for work, my pseudonymous writing and work online\u2014coming into and out of contact with a great many people I care deeply about, and my wedding provided the first chance I've ever really had to take people from those various fragments and give them a glimpse of the whole picture and the wonderful man that life has led me to. We married in front of an old mill in an aviary, under an arch with a Chinese double happiness sign hanging from it, our sisters standing by our sides as our ring-bearers and best men. Even the weather was generous to us, threatening rain all afternoon but providing only enough of a hint of it to shield us a bit from the August heat.\n\nI am a terrible planner in the best of circumstances, and I can't pretend my wedding planning was any less chaotic or slapdash than it would have been for any other event someone was unfortunate enough to put me in charge of. But there were a few key decisions I made, and many key decisions others made, that came together into a day more beautiful and perfect than I could have hoped. Given that, I feel a sort of responsibility both to write what I would have wanted to read about weddings for those who might find themselves in a similar spot (and, after all, who has not found themselves planning their own gay interracial marriage full of Mormons and weird online friends once or twice?) and to capture how the day felt for my own memories.\n\n###Inviting the Lads\n\nPeople often say the internet isn't real life, but I frankly see that as only so much cope. Pseudonyms or no, I have never been able to detach my online presence from who I am. No, I don't see people's faces, learn their names, or hear their voices online. Offline, though, I don't have nearly so many opportunities to take deep dives into topics I care about with people willing to respond in kind. You bare different parts of your soul in different places, and I place real value on the friendships I've built online. One of the earliest decisions I made with my wedding, then\u2014inspired in part by a friend whose face I saw for the first time when I flew out to his wedding\u2014was to invite a few groups of online friends.\n\nThe specific people came down to serendipity as much as anything. I wanted to limit my online invitations to groups rather than individuals to avoid pressuring people into a setting where they would know only me. Behind the public-facing internet, there exist secluded webs of conversation, stumbled into largely by chance, blossoming into occasional beauty with another roll of the dice. I've happened into several of those groups and grown particularly close with one or two, but am not sure they can genuinely be planned. Many I consider good friends or would love to have as friends happened to not be in one of these groups; prior attempts at forming similar societies emerged stillborn. I tossed group invitations into the abyss, and was happily astonished when some twenty online friends took me seriously and elected to attend, with most of them renting a grand mountain mansion for the weekend.\n\nI'll let one of them describe the weekend as a whole, should they choose to do so. For my part, I'll say that there's nothing quite like meeting good friends for the first time, suddenly matching real faces and real names with the formless thoughts and pseudonyms you've had countless conversations with. It's not often I have to guess which of my friends is which, with a pleasant mix of surprise and inevitability as each persona gets matched with a body\u2014of course that's how he would look and act. Their presence carried a sense of mystery and excitement through the weekend, a bridging of worlds that rarely have occasion to meet. Online conversations merged seamlessly into offline feasts and partying; family and friends with the good sense not to be terminally online got a glimpse of the internet misadventures that swallow so much of my time and the people I spend so much time writing alongside.\n\nIt was an unmitigated success, and I only wish I could have invited more. We even have engraved cups now, thanks to the ingenuity and generosity of one of the lads, and with them an implicit promise of many gatherings to come.\n\nOh, and I can assure you that [any rumors of \"weird cult nonsense\" at my bachelor party are wholly unfounded](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/730991434995597362/1009747007277121536/unknown.png).\n\n###The Whimsy Library\n\nNeither my husband nor I are particularly materialistic, and I have never been sold on the tradition of wedding registries full of household goods. When I need something, I get it; if I've been doing without, I prefer to keep doing without. I remember one friend's wedding with fondness in all regards save the thank-you note I got for giving them a [spiralizer](https://www.amazon.com/Spiralizer-Vegetable-Strongest-Heaviest-Gluten-Free/dp/B00GRIR87M) from their registry. I was glad to give a gift and wanted it to be worthwhile for them, but I can't pretend to any sentimental feelings towards spiralizers.\n\nWe would have been happy to forego gifts altogether, but my instinct was and is that many people value gift-giving as a part of the ritual of weddings, in a way that \"No gifts, please\" and \"In lieu of gifts, please consider making a donation on our behalf\" (while understandable options) don't quite capture. To bridge that tension, I settled on perhaps my favorite personal decision for the wedding: in lieu of traditional gifts, we asked each guest who wanted to provide a gift to bring a book they thought we should have and expected nobody else to bring. \n\nThis made each gift fascinating, personal, and charming: books that served as reminders of inside jokes, or the connections that drew us to the people present, a catalogue of people's favorites or a mirror of how they saw us. Beautifully bound stories to read with our future kids, cookbooks with cuisine holding personal meaning to the givers, a comic with a panel I quote to anyone who will listen, and all throughout peppered with heartfelt and moving reminders of those who gave them to us. I hope to catalogue the full Whimsy Library soon and expect it to remain a treasure in our home throughout our lives.\n\n###The Mormons and the Gays\n\nOn my wedding day, I learned that two more of my young cousins have elected to begin gender transitions\u2014and that the two girls I went on dates with in high school now date women themselves. I got to welcome a friend whose groomsman I had been and now-her wife, having gone from their once-straight wedding at a Mormon temple to my gay one at an aviary. With them, I got to see my uncle, remarried to a man\u2014which I only learned when I announced my own engagement on Facebook\u2014and my older brother, once married in a Mormon temple before joining me outside the faith. All of us grew up deeply enmeshed in Mormon faith and culture. All of us now find ourselves navigating peculiar new pathways opened to us by shifting cultural tides.\n\nAlongside them, I was deeply grateful to welcome dozens of active Mormons among my family and friends: grandparents, aunts and uncles, parents, my younger siblings, childhood neighbors and longtime friends. One neighbor in particular, who I had lived next door to through my whole childhood from the day he was born, was gracious enough to stop by less than a month before he heads out on his own Mormon mission. Many of my family and friends are devout, whether via strict adherence to Mormon orthodoxy or a determination to find a pathway forward within the faith through and around their own questions. \n\nI owe a great debt to the communitarian bonds and the social fabric of my erstwhile faith, a debt apparent throughout the planning and execution of the wedding. The photographer was a friend of my dad's from church, the wedding planner a church friend of my mom's. Rather than rent linens, we borrowed them from the local church woman's organization my mom leads as a volunteer. At every step, I relied heavily on my parents' help. As I say above, I am a poor and slapdash planner at best; without my parents' selfless, tireless efforts and their ties within their Mormon communities, I cannot imagine the wedding having gone nearly so well. Even standing outside my own tradition, I inevitably lean on it.\n\nUnderstand this: I know perfectly well the precarity of my position. I stepped away from Mormonism deliberately, after careful consideration, and without regret. The life path I have chosen is now fundamentally incompatible with its tenets. There is no telling of my life and family story that does not entail, on some level, a sense of brokenness and tragedy. From the faithful perspective, I am a determinedly wayward sheep who has brazenly abandoned the path to eternal happiness. From my own, the foundation of my culture\u2014the path my family has devoted their lives to for as long as it has been a path to follow\u2014is a scintillating mirage woven from the imagination of a man determined to sweep the world into a story of his invention. Neither I nor, I suspect, my family members can view the picture of my family and my once-neighborhood without a lurking hint of sorrow.\n\nMormonism is not an aggressive faith, for the most part. It's been years since someone has seen a need to condemn my pathway to my face, and even those who did those years ago tried to do so from a place of love. You learn from the invitations left unanswered and the messages left unsent which of your loved ones no longer know how to fit you into their worlds. Most of the time, those bridges had been neglected and [left slowly falling into disrepair](https://pics.me.me/i-dont-burn-bridges-i-just-fail-to-maintain-them-59717779.png) regardless, but some of the silences do sting.\n\nBut we persist. I hug my friend and wish him well on his journey to spread the message of Joseph Smith; he hugs me back and wishes me well in a marriage even Joseph Smith could not have imagined. I hug my grandparents and they welcome my husband into their family and into their prayers. I hug my little cousins, who I watch choosing new names and new clothing, and find that it's my turn to fret as I see them entering paths to more complicated and\u2014I fear\u2014less peaceful lives. We take family pictures and have family dinners and enjoy each other's presence on that rare occasion we have all had an excuse to travel to the same spot. We embrace the moments we get, even knowing the contradictions that underlie them.\n\nI can't help but think of the musical Fiddler on the Roof as I watch the continued development of my family and childhood friends. This tension between traditional communities and sweeping modernity is not, itself, a new experience. The story of an orthodox Jew watching his daughters marry outside his tradition around the turn of the 20th century repeats with Mormon parents watching their son marry a man in the 21st, and has repeated many times and many places. Perhaps this, too, is tradition. \n\nThere is an inherent tension in this position, one that can never wholly depart. But life has always been full of tension, and people have always found a way towards beauty regardless. I do not need to resolve the impossible to appreciate celebrating my wedding day alongside the Mormons I love, nor they to celebrate with me. They are there in the moments that matter to me; I aspire to be there in those that matter to them\u2014finding our own triumphs, making our own mistakes, and building what we can. \n\nThe hint of tragedy is inevitable, but I am extraordinarily lucky. The Mormons in my life have always been uncommonly good to me. My family and friends were unreserved in showing their support for my husband and me at our wedding. A gay wedding full of Mormons is a peculiar thing, but it was a gift I will cherish.\n\n###A Word on Words\n\nThat's enough of the bittersweet. It's something I wanted to address, but the moment was one of joy, and I don't mean to summon a cloud that was not present.\n\nInstead, I want to talk about that most dreaded of occasions, the wedding toast: the moment when someone stands up to talk and the crowded room waits with bated breath to find whether they've subscribed to ten minutes of loose rambling or a tightly prepared minute or two of charming memories. I can't objectively say whether the guests who gave toasts were uncommonly good at the task or whether my husband and I were just primed to love everything they said\u2014and certainly that played a part\u2014but the toasts linger in my heart.\n\nWe chose three speakers each, all from disparate corners of our lives: our sisters who could speak to our upbringings, my childhood friend who saw more of my development than almost anyone else, my husband's college friend who came with a group of seven others from the same storied dorm, a representative for my weird online friends who could speak a bit to my peculiar double life, and finally a couple my husband works alongside\u2014friends of ours who were perhaps the only people there to really know us as a couple.\n\nWhile we hung on every word they had to say, I suspect even those long-suffering readers who have read this far would be less eager than I am to hear a blow-by-blow of each toast. I will focus on only two moments, points where the speakers had prepared long before they could have known they would have wedding toasts to give.\n\nMy husband's college friend, it turns out, put me to shame, collecting all of the embarrassing stories about my husband of the sort I should be inflicting on others. Here are a few of the ones he shared at the wedding:\n\n* My husband has some peculiar eating habits, from a pathological fear of salt to an inhumanly large appetite\u2014he tends to eat dinner out of a mixing bowl. Rather than gorge himself to obesity, though, he instead eats more vegetables than any man alive. As his friend told it, he would grab a twelve-ounce bag of frozen broccoli each night and have it alongside whatever he ate, but planned poorly and found himself without broccoli during a storm at one point. Not content to go without for a night, he marched through a storm to the nearest grocery store, grabbed his broccoli, and returned triumphant with his feast. He has since upgraded his approach, adding a bag of green beans to that bag of broccoli every night. Even after a four-course meal at our local reception the other night, he ate his beans and broccoli. But I digress.\n\n* Given the choice between a familiar restaurant and something new, my husband will pick the unusual option every time. It was no surprise, then, when he insisted on dragging his friends to a Japanese restaurant with some odd options one time they travelled to another city. Asian food, he had insisted, was what he was in the mood for, so they obliged. Upon arriving at the restaurant, he glanced at the menu and promptly ordered, ah, a hamburger. He maintains it was justified because the burger had wagyu beef, but his friends were not impressed.\n\n* A couple of times, my husband got, well, a bit mixed up about objects or locations. He pulled the friend excitedly down to the kitchen to eat mangoes one day\u2014oddly round and fuzzy mangoes, that is, with wrinkled pits. Some of us know them as peaches. Another time, he had begun to fixate on Taiwan, expressing interest in visiting or trying more of their delicious food\u2014you know, pad thai and massaman curry and the like. Since then, he's cleared up the difference between Taiwan and Thailand, and evidently first experimented with making his (excellent) Thai curries at that time, so it all seems to have worked out.\n\nAlways keep a running tab of embarrassing stories about your friends in case they ask you to toast at their weddings. Their spouses will thank you.\n\nAs for me, I was doing alright keeping my tears in check at the wedding right up until my sister's toast. But she ambushed me. Her whole toast was deeply personal and moving. I won't embarrass her by repeating all the too-kind things she said about me, but my account of the night wouldn't be complete if I didn't mention the paper she quoted in the toast and handed to me after it. \n\nWhen she was twelve\u2014as I learned during her wedding-day toast\u2014on a school assignment to write about an important person in her life, she chose to write about me. I don't know that another piece of writing can ever move me as much as that school essay, presciently noticed and saved by my mom, did. I'll quote only a few excerpts:\n\n&gt; Without [Trace] [...] there would be a huge void in our lives. He is our troubled genius. [...] He could be anything he wanted to be, if he chose; but there is nothing he wants to be. [...] [Trace] listens to me when I need it, and gives advice. Yet sometimes I think he is the one who needs advice, who needs comfort. He has a hard time at school, often. He doesn't always get along with teachers. I wish I could help him. I wish I could make things easier for him\u2014he is so smart, but he has a hard time. However, I trust him and hope for him to come out on top. I love my brother [Trace].\n\nShe ambushed me with that. *At my wedding.* Then she went on to note, rightly, how amazing my husband is and how good he has been for me. I sobbed.\n\nShe wasn't wrong to note that I was a deeply unhappy teenager\u2014it took me close to a decade after she wrote that assignment to really come into my own. Her life, between then and now, has been much rougher than she or anyone deserves. I was terrified while I was in Australia that I would come home to the news that she was no longer with us. But she, too, has come into her own. You should have seen her, there at the wedding. She was magnificent, wholly in her element, for once attending an event at a place she's helped host events for years. She prepared much of the decoration, she helped lead setup, she directed the guests. And then she ambushed me with *that*. \n\nIt's hardly fair.\n\n###The Vows Under the Arch\n\nAs I planned this wedding, the recollections and advice of my friend Gemma in particular lingered in my mind, perhaps nowhere more so than in [her thoughts on vows](https://gemcode.dreamwidth.org/3637.html). That essay shapes and reflects my own thoughts on the value and limits of tradition\u2014\"We can shop around, make alterations, import the wisdom of our ancestors where it seems good and quietly ignore it when it seems bad\"\u2014and I referred back to it regularly when thinking about my own vows to my new husband. In the end, this was my vow, paired with a few sentences to express my love:\n\n&gt; I take you to be my lawfully wedded husband and the companion of my heart\u2014to have and to hold from this day forward, in joy and in sorrow, in strength and in weakness, in sickness and in health, to grow together and to build together, as long as we both shall exist.\n\nI opted to depart from the traditional form more than Gemma did, choosing words that evoked it without fully occupying it, before shifting more fully towards my own form at the end. The nods towards growth and building reflect my own preoccupations, capturing the image of marriage I hope to live up to\u2014one where the image of being perfect just as one is gets set aside for one of mutual determination towards progress towards what one could be. \n\nIn Mormon tradition and faith, marriages are \"for time and all eternity\" instead of \"until death do us part.\" While I can no longer claim an authentic stake in that, its memory echoes in my mind and makes me flinch away from phrasing that implies a time to part. I cannot claim to believe I will exist for eternity unless humanity learns to wrest its eternal survival from an uncaring world, but I have always taken marriage to be a commitment with no expiry. My phrasing (\"as long as we both shall exist\") was the best I could find to convey that.\n\nMy writing online has always been personal, but it feels somehow more so to talk about just what my husband means to me. Still, it would hardly do to write a wedding post without trying to capture a bit about the man whose name I took through it and the path that led me to him. \n\nThere was no point in my life when I was a closeted gay man. Rather, I thought of myself as both incapable of falling in love and uninterested in it until around the time I stepped away from Mormonism, and frankly wondered if I would remain cut off from that core human experience forever. Noticing my own attraction to men after I left Mormonism, then, came as a profound relief to me\u2014finally, a chance at love\u2014and I never had a reason to obscure it. Even then, though, the core of loneliness and the fear that I was somehow unlovable\u2014at least in a romantic sense\u2014remained.\n\nFrom the day I met my husband, being with him has felt vital and wholly right. I remember watching him take a silly personality quiz for me on one of our earlier dates and getting my every answer right, remember slowly opening up about every one of my peculiarities and flaws, remember his unconditional and immediate love for me both despite and because of a precise view of me. I remember him asking permission to hug on our first date so cautiously that I couldn't be sure he was even looking for more than a friend, remember the home-cooked Korean food and the kiss he politely offered me on our second date, remember my slowly dawning conviction I had found someone extraordinary. I remember the way, almost immediately, that loneliness faded, replaced with a conviction that I needed him by my side.\n\nIt's not that we're identical, or even close to it. It would be a colossal error for me to date someone too like myself. We are instead consciously complementary. He is prudent where I am adventurous, particular where I am laid back, practical where I am idealistic. He tells me stories of the patients he sees and the research he works on, I rant wildly to him about whichever peculiar topic has seized hold of my mind. He goes to bed between 10 and 11 every night he can manage, while I hunch over a keyboard writing until odd hours of the morning every night I don't let him drag me towards a healthier schedule. You are unlikely to see him post much, if ever, online, and with that he anchors me in reality. I feel whole alongside him and can imagine no one I would rather raise a family alongside. \n\nI love him dearly. I am his, now and always. \n\n###Conclusion\n\nI'd ask you to forgive the saccharine overload, but you are, after all, reading a wedding essay. It comes with the territory. It's obvious in retrospect why the wedding meant so much to me, but I suppose some things need to be experienced firsthand to be understood. There's more I could go into\u2014more I will go into, really, in the thank-you notes I'm still scrambling to write and the conversations I will continue to have. But this is more than enough for now. \n\nI am, in the end, thrilled to rest and to be done with that weekend. As much as anything else, a wedding carries a sense of duty\u2014to your partner, of course, but just as much to the attendees who spend money and time to celebrate with you. I am not particularly outgoing by nature, but I committed during that weekend to spend as much time as possible with those who had come a long way to be present\u2014whirling between conversations and events and friends and families and responsibilities. It was worth the effort\u2014every bit of it, broadly against my expectations, was worth the effort\u2014but it is an effort I am in no hurry to repeat.\n\nMy wedding was beautiful, the sort of storybook wedding children-who-are-not-me dream of, the sort I never planned on or anticipated. I knew I wanted to defy my natural inclination and manifest a ritual that would invite friends and family to see the man I love. From that, despite my own chaotic and sporadic planning, those friends and family wove a gift I cannot help but treasure. For the first time in my life, the scattered fragments of my history and personality came together into a cohesive whole, a moment of being seen as I aim to be, next to the man I am honored to be with. My heart is full.\n\nThese are the joyous times. \n\nThank you for reading.\n\n*Originally posted [here](https://tracingwoodgrains.substack.com/p/a-gay-wedding-full-of-mormons), with a few more pictures*", "author_fullname": "t2_eu1v4dp", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Gay Wedding Full of Mormons: My account of my wedding day", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wvsaly", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 66, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": "991bceb0-301f-11e9-a749-0ed81f530880", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 66, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661269857.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;n.b. As is my custom, this piece uses Mormon as shorthand for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who express a preference to avoid the nickname. I usually do not make a note of it, but particularly in a piece like this in which I express deep gratitude for the LDS people in my life I want to emphasize that I use the shorthand out of longstanding personal appreciation for and familiarity with the term, not with intent to dismiss their faith or preferences.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, my wedding day was the best day of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, I know that&amp;#39;s how people always said weddings were supposed to be. But I&amp;#39;ve never been much of one for big events, for ceremonies, for pomp and circumstance. While I&amp;#39;ve never been persuaded by messaging like &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/CountMoriarty/status/1560703561843056640\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s been a big part of the water in which I swim:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Better option is not to have weddings at all and invite no one. Why pay tens of thousands of pounds for a single day when the marriage probably won&amp;#39;t last and you won&amp;#39;t see half of the relatives again. I can&amp;#39;t think of a worse waste of money and time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So much cost, so much fuss, so much demand for people to fly out and set time aside and dress up. The notion of an event inspired more tension than excitement for me, and my husband-to-be would just as soon have wandered into a courthouse one Saturday and called it a day. But I felt a sense of duty and one of ritual importance to bring friends and family together for a core moment in my life, particularly since I&amp;#39;ve been something of a nomad throughout my adulthood. I&amp;#39;m a latecomer to this sort of appreciation of tradition and ritual, at times willing to occupy forms without fully feeling the value of them. So I gritted my teeth and elected to prepare a traditional wedding over my own trepidation and the shrugs of the man I love\u2014or at least as traditional a wedding as is possible when one leaves the faith and culture of his ancestors and marries not the Mormon-woman-in-a-temple he had always been taught to plan for, but a man he stumbled across on a dating app.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an unusual event, but a joyous one\u2014not only for the chance to call the man I love my husband, but for the many friends and family members from various corners of my life who showed up to offer their support and love. I have lived an unusually fragmented life\u2014my childhood in Utah, my Mormon mission in Australia, my jumping from place to place for work, my pseudonymous writing and work online\u2014coming into and out of contact with a great many people I care deeply about, and my wedding provided the first chance I&amp;#39;ve ever really had to take people from those various fragments and give them a glimpse of the whole picture and the wonderful man that life has led me to. We married in front of an old mill in an aviary, under an arch with a Chinese double happiness sign hanging from it, our sisters standing by our sides as our ring-bearers and best men. Even the weather was generous to us, threatening rain all afternoon but providing only enough of a hint of it to shield us a bit from the August heat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a terrible planner in the best of circumstances, and I can&amp;#39;t pretend my wedding planning was any less chaotic or slapdash than it would have been for any other event someone was unfortunate enough to put me in charge of. But there were a few key decisions I made, and many key decisions others made, that came together into a day more beautiful and perfect than I could have hoped. Given that, I feel a sort of responsibility both to write what I would have wanted to read about weddings for those who might find themselves in a similar spot (and, after all, who has not found themselves planning their own gay interracial marriage full of Mormons and weird online friends once or twice?) and to capture how the day felt for my own memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Inviting the Lads&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People often say the internet isn&amp;#39;t real life, but I frankly see that as only so much cope. Pseudonyms or no, I have never been able to detach my online presence from who I am. No, I don&amp;#39;t see people&amp;#39;s faces, learn their names, or hear their voices online. Offline, though, I don&amp;#39;t have nearly so many opportunities to take deep dives into topics I care about with people willing to respond in kind. You bare different parts of your soul in different places, and I place real value on the friendships I&amp;#39;ve built online. One of the earliest decisions I made with my wedding, then\u2014inspired in part by a friend whose face I saw for the first time when I flew out to his wedding\u2014was to invite a few groups of online friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The specific people came down to serendipity as much as anything. I wanted to limit my online invitations to groups rather than individuals to avoid pressuring people into a setting where they would know only me. Behind the public-facing internet, there exist secluded webs of conversation, stumbled into largely by chance, blossoming into occasional beauty with another roll of the dice. I&amp;#39;ve happened into several of those groups and grown particularly close with one or two, but am not sure they can genuinely be planned. Many I consider good friends or would love to have as friends happened to not be in one of these groups; prior attempts at forming similar societies emerged stillborn. I tossed group invitations into the abyss, and was happily astonished when some twenty online friends took me seriously and elected to attend, with most of them renting a grand mountain mansion for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll let one of them describe the weekend as a whole, should they choose to do so. For my part, I&amp;#39;ll say that there&amp;#39;s nothing quite like meeting good friends for the first time, suddenly matching real faces and real names with the formless thoughts and pseudonyms you&amp;#39;ve had countless conversations with. It&amp;#39;s not often I have to guess which of my friends is which, with a pleasant mix of surprise and inevitability as each persona gets matched with a body\u2014of course that&amp;#39;s how he would look and act. Their presence carried a sense of mystery and excitement through the weekend, a bridging of worlds that rarely have occasion to meet. Online conversations merged seamlessly into offline feasts and partying; family and friends with the good sense not to be terminally online got a glimpse of the internet misadventures that swallow so much of my time and the people I spend so much time writing alongside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an unmitigated success, and I only wish I could have invited more. We even have engraved cups now, thanks to the ingenuity and generosity of one of the lads, and with them an implicit promise of many gatherings to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I can assure you that &lt;a href=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/730991434995597362/1009747007277121536/unknown.png\"&gt;any rumors of &amp;quot;weird cult nonsense&amp;quot; at my bachelor party are wholly unfounded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Whimsy Library&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither my husband nor I are particularly materialistic, and I have never been sold on the tradition of wedding registries full of household goods. When I need something, I get it; if I&amp;#39;ve been doing without, I prefer to keep doing without. I remember one friend&amp;#39;s wedding with fondness in all regards save the thank-you note I got for giving them a &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spiralizer-Vegetable-Strongest-Heaviest-Gluten-Free/dp/B00GRIR87M\"&gt;spiralizer&lt;/a&gt; from their registry. I was glad to give a gift and wanted it to be worthwhile for them, but I can&amp;#39;t pretend to any sentimental feelings towards spiralizers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would have been happy to forego gifts altogether, but my instinct was and is that many people value gift-giving as a part of the ritual of weddings, in a way that &amp;quot;No gifts, please&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;In lieu of gifts, please consider making a donation on our behalf&amp;quot; (while understandable options) don&amp;#39;t quite capture. To bridge that tension, I settled on perhaps my favorite personal decision for the wedding: in lieu of traditional gifts, we asked each guest who wanted to provide a gift to bring a book they thought we should have and expected nobody else to bring. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This made each gift fascinating, personal, and charming: books that served as reminders of inside jokes, or the connections that drew us to the people present, a catalogue of people&amp;#39;s favorites or a mirror of how they saw us. Beautifully bound stories to read with our future kids, cookbooks with cuisine holding personal meaning to the givers, a comic with a panel I quote to anyone who will listen, and all throughout peppered with heartfelt and moving reminders of those who gave them to us. I hope to catalogue the full Whimsy Library soon and expect it to remain a treasure in our home throughout our lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Mormons and the Gays&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On my wedding day, I learned that two more of my young cousins have elected to begin gender transitions\u2014and that the two girls I went on dates with in high school now date women themselves. I got to welcome a friend whose groomsman I had been and now-her wife, having gone from their once-straight wedding at a Mormon temple to my gay one at an aviary. With them, I got to see my uncle, remarried to a man\u2014which I only learned when I announced my own engagement on Facebook\u2014and my older brother, once married in a Mormon temple before joining me outside the faith. All of us grew up deeply enmeshed in Mormon faith and culture. All of us now find ourselves navigating peculiar new pathways opened to us by shifting cultural tides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alongside them, I was deeply grateful to welcome dozens of active Mormons among my family and friends: grandparents, aunts and uncles, parents, my younger siblings, childhood neighbors and longtime friends. One neighbor in particular, who I had lived next door to through my whole childhood from the day he was born, was gracious enough to stop by less than a month before he heads out on his own Mormon mission. Many of my family and friends are devout, whether via strict adherence to Mormon orthodoxy or a determination to find a pathway forward within the faith through and around their own questions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I owe a great debt to the communitarian bonds and the social fabric of my erstwhile faith, a debt apparent throughout the planning and execution of the wedding. The photographer was a friend of my dad&amp;#39;s from church, the wedding planner a church friend of my mom&amp;#39;s. Rather than rent linens, we borrowed them from the local church woman&amp;#39;s organization my mom leads as a volunteer. At every step, I relied heavily on my parents&amp;#39; help. As I say above, I am a poor and slapdash planner at best; without my parents&amp;#39; selfless, tireless efforts and their ties within their Mormon communities, I cannot imagine the wedding having gone nearly so well. Even standing outside my own tradition, I inevitably lean on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understand this: I know perfectly well the precarity of my position. I stepped away from Mormonism deliberately, after careful consideration, and without regret. The life path I have chosen is now fundamentally incompatible with its tenets. There is no telling of my life and family story that does not entail, on some level, a sense of brokenness and tragedy. From the faithful perspective, I am a determinedly wayward sheep who has brazenly abandoned the path to eternal happiness. From my own, the foundation of my culture\u2014the path my family has devoted their lives to for as long as it has been a path to follow\u2014is a scintillating mirage woven from the imagination of a man determined to sweep the world into a story of his invention. Neither I nor, I suspect, my family members can view the picture of my family and my once-neighborhood without a lurking hint of sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mormonism is not an aggressive faith, for the most part. It&amp;#39;s been years since someone has seen a need to condemn my pathway to my face, and even those who did those years ago tried to do so from a place of love. You learn from the invitations left unanswered and the messages left unsent which of your loved ones no longer know how to fit you into their worlds. Most of the time, those bridges had been neglected and &lt;a href=\"https://pics.me.me/i-dont-burn-bridges-i-just-fail-to-maintain-them-59717779.png\"&gt;left slowly falling into disrepair&lt;/a&gt; regardless, but some of the silences do sting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we persist. I hug my friend and wish him well on his journey to spread the message of Joseph Smith; he hugs me back and wishes me well in a marriage even Joseph Smith could not have imagined. I hug my grandparents and they welcome my husband into their family and into their prayers. I hug my little cousins, who I watch choosing new names and new clothing, and find that it&amp;#39;s my turn to fret as I see them entering paths to more complicated and\u2014I fear\u2014less peaceful lives. We take family pictures and have family dinners and enjoy each other&amp;#39;s presence on that rare occasion we have all had an excuse to travel to the same spot. We embrace the moments we get, even knowing the contradictions that underlie them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but think of the musical Fiddler on the Roof as I watch the continued development of my family and childhood friends. This tension between traditional communities and sweeping modernity is not, itself, a new experience. The story of an orthodox Jew watching his daughters marry outside his tradition around the turn of the 20th century repeats with Mormon parents watching their son marry a man in the 21st, and has repeated many times and many places. Perhaps this, too, is tradition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is an inherent tension in this position, one that can never wholly depart. But life has always been full of tension, and people have always found a way towards beauty regardless. I do not need to resolve the impossible to appreciate celebrating my wedding day alongside the Mormons I love, nor they to celebrate with me. They are there in the moments that matter to me; I aspire to be there in those that matter to them\u2014finding our own triumphs, making our own mistakes, and building what we can. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hint of tragedy is inevitable, but I am extraordinarily lucky. The Mormons in my life have always been uncommonly good to me. My family and friends were unreserved in showing their support for my husband and me at our wedding. A gay wedding full of Mormons is a peculiar thing, but it was a gift I will cherish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;A Word on Words&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s enough of the bittersweet. It&amp;#39;s something I wanted to address, but the moment was one of joy, and I don&amp;#39;t mean to summon a cloud that was not present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I want to talk about that most dreaded of occasions, the wedding toast: the moment when someone stands up to talk and the crowded room waits with bated breath to find whether they&amp;#39;ve subscribed to ten minutes of loose rambling or a tightly prepared minute or two of charming memories. I can&amp;#39;t objectively say whether the guests who gave toasts were uncommonly good at the task or whether my husband and I were just primed to love everything they said\u2014and certainly that played a part\u2014but the toasts linger in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We chose three speakers each, all from disparate corners of our lives: our sisters who could speak to our upbringings, my childhood friend who saw more of my development than almost anyone else, my husband&amp;#39;s college friend who came with a group of seven others from the same storied dorm, a representative for my weird online friends who could speak a bit to my peculiar double life, and finally a couple my husband works alongside\u2014friends of ours who were perhaps the only people there to really know us as a couple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While we hung on every word they had to say, I suspect even those long-suffering readers who have read this far would be less eager than I am to hear a blow-by-blow of each toast. I will focus on only two moments, points where the speakers had prepared long before they could have known they would have wedding toasts to give.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband&amp;#39;s college friend, it turns out, put me to shame, collecting all of the embarrassing stories about my husband of the sort I should be inflicting on others. Here are a few of the ones he shared at the wedding:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband has some peculiar eating habits, from a pathological fear of salt to an inhumanly large appetite\u2014he tends to eat dinner out of a mixing bowl. Rather than gorge himself to obesity, though, he instead eats more vegetables than any man alive. As his friend told it, he would grab a twelve-ounce bag of frozen broccoli each night and have it alongside whatever he ate, but planned poorly and found himself without broccoli during a storm at one point. Not content to go without for a night, he marched through a storm to the nearest grocery store, grabbed his broccoli, and returned triumphant with his feast. He has since upgraded his approach, adding a bag of green beans to that bag of broccoli every night. Even after a four-course meal at our local reception the other night, he ate his beans and broccoli. But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the choice between a familiar restaurant and something new, my husband will pick the unusual option every time. It was no surprise, then, when he insisted on dragging his friends to a Japanese restaurant with some odd options one time they travelled to another city. Asian food, he had insisted, was what he was in the mood for, so they obliged. Upon arriving at the restaurant, he glanced at the menu and promptly ordered, ah, a hamburger. He maintains it was justified because the burger had wagyu beef, but his friends were not impressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of times, my husband got, well, a bit mixed up about objects or locations. He pulled the friend excitedly down to the kitchen to eat mangoes one day\u2014oddly round and fuzzy mangoes, that is, with wrinkled pits. Some of us know them as peaches. Another time, he had begun to fixate on Taiwan, expressing interest in visiting or trying more of their delicious food\u2014you know, pad thai and massaman curry and the like. Since then, he&amp;#39;s cleared up the difference between Taiwan and Thailand, and evidently first experimented with making his (excellent) Thai curries at that time, so it all seems to have worked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always keep a running tab of embarrassing stories about your friends in case they ask you to toast at their weddings. Their spouses will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for me, I was doing alright keeping my tears in check at the wedding right up until my sister&amp;#39;s toast. But she ambushed me. Her whole toast was deeply personal and moving. I won&amp;#39;t embarrass her by repeating all the too-kind things she said about me, but my account of the night wouldn&amp;#39;t be complete if I didn&amp;#39;t mention the paper she quoted in the toast and handed to me after it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she was twelve\u2014as I learned during her wedding-day toast\u2014on a school assignment to write about an important person in her life, she chose to write about me. I don&amp;#39;t know that another piece of writing can ever move me as much as that school essay, presciently noticed and saved by my mom, did. I&amp;#39;ll quote only a few excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Without [Trace] [...] there would be a huge void in our lives. He is our troubled genius. [...] He could be anything he wanted to be, if he chose; but there is nothing he wants to be. [...] [Trace] listens to me when I need it, and gives advice. Yet sometimes I think he is the one who needs advice, who needs comfort. He has a hard time at school, often. He doesn&amp;#39;t always get along with teachers. I wish I could help him. I wish I could make things easier for him\u2014he is so smart, but he has a hard time. However, I trust him and hope for him to come out on top. I love my brother [Trace].&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She ambushed me with that. &lt;em&gt;At my wedding.&lt;/em&gt; Then she went on to note, rightly, how amazing my husband is and how good he has been for me. I sobbed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wasn&amp;#39;t wrong to note that I was a deeply unhappy teenager\u2014it took me close to a decade after she wrote that assignment to really come into my own. Her life, between then and now, has been much rougher than she or anyone deserves. I was terrified while I was in Australia that I would come home to the news that she was no longer with us. But she, too, has come into her own. You should have seen her, there at the wedding. She was magnificent, wholly in her element, for once attending an event at a place she&amp;#39;s helped host events for years. She prepared much of the decoration, she helped lead setup, she directed the guests. And then she ambushed me with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hardly fair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Vows Under the Arch&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I planned this wedding, the recollections and advice of my friend Gemma in particular lingered in my mind, perhaps nowhere more so than in &lt;a href=\"https://gemcode.dreamwidth.org/3637.html\"&gt;her thoughts on vows&lt;/a&gt;. That essay shapes and reflects my own thoughts on the value and limits of tradition\u2014&amp;quot;We can shop around, make alterations, import the wisdom of our ancestors where it seems good and quietly ignore it when it seems bad&amp;quot;\u2014and I referred back to it regularly when thinking about my own vows to my new husband. In the end, this was my vow, paired with a few sentences to express my love:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I take you to be my lawfully wedded husband and the companion of my heart\u2014to have and to hold from this day forward, in joy and in sorrow, in strength and in weakness, in sickness and in health, to grow together and to build together, as long as we both shall exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opted to depart from the traditional form more than Gemma did, choosing words that evoked it without fully occupying it, before shifting more fully towards my own form at the end. The nods towards growth and building reflect my own preoccupations, capturing the image of marriage I hope to live up to\u2014one where the image of being perfect just as one is gets set aside for one of mutual determination towards progress towards what one could be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Mormon tradition and faith, marriages are &amp;quot;for time and all eternity&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;until death do us part.&amp;quot; While I can no longer claim an authentic stake in that, its memory echoes in my mind and makes me flinch away from phrasing that implies a time to part. I cannot claim to believe I will exist for eternity unless humanity learns to wrest its eternal survival from an uncaring world, but I have always taken marriage to be a commitment with no expiry. My phrasing (&amp;quot;as long as we both shall exist&amp;quot;) was the best I could find to convey that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My writing online has always been personal, but it feels somehow more so to talk about just what my husband means to me. Still, it would hardly do to write a wedding post without trying to capture a bit about the man whose name I took through it and the path that led me to him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no point in my life when I was a closeted gay man. Rather, I thought of myself as both incapable of falling in love and uninterested in it until around the time I stepped away from Mormonism, and frankly wondered if I would remain cut off from that core human experience forever. Noticing my own attraction to men after I left Mormonism, then, came as a profound relief to me\u2014finally, a chance at love\u2014and I never had a reason to obscure it. Even then, though, the core of loneliness and the fear that I was somehow unlovable\u2014at least in a romantic sense\u2014remained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the day I met my husband, being with him has felt vital and wholly right. I remember watching him take a silly personality quiz for me on one of our earlier dates and getting my every answer right, remember slowly opening up about every one of my peculiarities and flaws, remember his unconditional and immediate love for me both despite and because of a precise view of me. I remember him asking permission to hug on our first date so cautiously that I couldn&amp;#39;t be sure he was even looking for more than a friend, remember the home-cooked Korean food and the kiss he politely offered me on our second date, remember my slowly dawning conviction I had found someone extraordinary. I remember the way, almost immediately, that loneliness faded, replaced with a conviction that I needed him by my side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that we&amp;#39;re identical, or even close to it. It would be a colossal error for me to date someone too like myself. We are instead consciously complementary. He is prudent where I am adventurous, particular where I am laid back, practical where I am idealistic. He tells me stories of the patients he sees and the research he works on, I rant wildly to him about whichever peculiar topic has seized hold of my mind. He goes to bed between 10 and 11 every night he can manage, while I hunch over a keyboard writing until odd hours of the morning every night I don&amp;#39;t let him drag me towards a healthier schedule. You are unlikely to see him post much, if ever, online, and with that he anchors me in reality. I feel whole alongside him and can imagine no one I would rather raise a family alongside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love him dearly. I am his, now and always. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d ask you to forgive the saccharine overload, but you are, after all, reading a wedding essay. It comes with the territory. It&amp;#39;s obvious in retrospect why the wedding meant so much to me, but I suppose some things need to be experienced firsthand to be understood. There&amp;#39;s more I could go into\u2014more I will go into, really, in the thank-you notes I&amp;#39;m still scrambling to write and the conversations I will continue to have. But this is more than enough for now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am, in the end, thrilled to rest and to be done with that weekend. As much as anything else, a wedding carries a sense of duty\u2014to your partner, of course, but just as much to the attendees who spend money and time to celebrate with you. I am not particularly outgoing by nature, but I committed during that weekend to spend as much time as possible with those who had come a long way to be present\u2014whirling between conversations and events and friends and families and responsibilities. It was worth the effort\u2014every bit of it, broadly against my expectations, was worth the effort\u2014but it is an effort I am in no hurry to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wedding was beautiful, the sort of storybook wedding children-who-are-not-me dream of, the sort I never planned on or anticipated. I knew I wanted to defy my natural inclination and manifest a ritual that would invite friends and family to see the man I love. From that, despite my own chaotic and sporadic planning, those friends and family wove a gift I cannot help but treasure. For the first time in my life, the scattered fragments of my history and personality came together into a cohesive whole, a moment of being seen as I aim to be, next to the man I am honored to be with. My heart is full.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are the joyous times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=\"https://tracingwoodgrains.substack.com/p/a-gay-wedding-full-of-mormons\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with a few more pictures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "First, do no harm", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "wvsaly", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TracingWoodgrains", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 66, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wvsaly/a_gay_wedding_full_of_mormons_my_account_of_my/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wvsaly/a_gay_wedding_full_of_mormons_my_account_of_my/", "subreddit_subscribers": 18624, "created_utc": 1661269857.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "selftext": "This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts.

You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on &amp;#39;report&amp;#39; at the bottom of the post, selecting &amp;#39;this breaks &lt;a href=\"/r/themotte\"&gt;r/themotte&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s rules, or is of interest to the mods&amp;#39; from the pop-up menu and then selecting &amp;#39;Actually a quality contribution&amp;#39; from the sub-menu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locking Your Own Posts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We&amp;#39;ve got a solution for you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they&amp;#39;re long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For each post &lt;em&gt;except the last one&lt;/em&gt;, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase &lt;code&gt;automod_multipart_lockme&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can then edit it to remove that phrase and it&amp;#39;ll stay locked. This means that &lt;em&gt;you cannot unlock your post on your own&lt;/em&gt;, so make sure you do this &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;ve posted your entire series. Also, don&amp;#39;t lock the last one or people can&amp;#39;t respond to you. &lt;em&gt;Also&lt;/em&gt;, this gets reported to the mods, so don&amp;#39;t abuse it or we&amp;#39;ll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\"&gt;https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redditsearch.io/\"&gt;RedditSearch.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://camas.unddit.com/\"&gt;Camas Reddit Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Append &lt;code&gt;?sort=old&amp;amp;depth=1&lt;/code&gt; to the end of this page&amp;#39;s URL&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": "moderator", "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "wulqxp", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2177, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/", "subreddit_subscribers": 18624, "created_utc": 1661148908.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "selftext": "I may be on the wrong track, or on the right track in principle but the wrong approach to it.
