['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 29, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_x0hc17", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661753708.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

I gave at [ESPR](https://espr-camp.org/), in preparation for a Fermithon, i.e., a Fermi estimates tournament.*\n\nFermi estimation is a method for arriving an estimate of an uncertain variable of interest. Given a variable of interest, sometimes you can decompose it into steps, and multiplying those steps together gives you a more accurate estimate than estimating the thing you want to know directly. I'll go through a proof sketch for this at the end of the post.\n\nIf you want to take over the world, why should you care about this? Well, you may care about this if you hope that having better models of the world would lead you to make better decisions, and to better achieve your goals. And Fermi estimates are one way of training or showing off the skill of building models of the world. They have fast feedback loops, because you can in many cases then check the answer on the internet afterwards. But they are probably most useful in cases where you can't.\n\nThe rest of the class was a trial by fire: I presented some questions, students gave their own estimates, and then briefly discussed them. In case you want to give it a try before seeing the answers, the questions I considered were:\n\n1. How many people have covid in the UK right now (2022-08-20)?\n2. How many cumulative person years did people live in/under the Soviet Union?\n3. How many intelligent species does the universe hold outside of Earth?\n4. Are any staff members dating?\n5.

https://old.reddit.com/r/theschism/comments/vz1r1l/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_4/)\n\n##Chapter 5\n\nMy apologies for the delay, this chapter was just so boring in comparison to all the interesting historiography Gottfried did in the previous chapters. But it\u2019s worthwhile as a topic, so here we go.\n\nGottfried starts by explaining the desire in the 1930s by people like Oswald Mosley to create some kind of pan-European unity on the right. They weren\u2019t uniform in their promotion of fascism, but they didn\u2019t see fascism as needing to be done by each country independently. As Gottfried writes it, there was a hope that \u201cThey [fascist countries] could all cooperate in building a new European order and, in the near term, opposing the threat represented by international bolshevism.\u201d\n\nWe now get a lengthy examination of fascist fiction as proof of this hope, starting with the novel *Gilles*, published in 1939 by Pierre Drieu La Rochelle.\n\nAt one point in the novel, the protagonist ends up on a boat with a Pole and an Irishman. When the latter two are asked about why they are fascists, they claim to support the Catholic Church and look to combine \u201cthe ancient with the modern. There\u2019s more debate and discussion about questions like \u201cwhat if the Church doesn\u2019t support fascism or promotes anti-fascism?\u201d and \u201cwhat if Poland tried to ally with the Soviet Union to stop a German invasion?\u201d The answers show that both men are not tied to their countries, but to the promotion of some fascist world order which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean one country rules all. They view rule by democracies as bad as being ruled by the Soviets. The protagonist laments Germany\u2019s \u201cdefective fascism\u201d, hoping it will see the light and vow to honor other European nations\u2019 territory to defeat the Red Menace.\n\nThis protagonist is a reflection of the author\u2019s own views, as one might expect. He\u2019s an admirer of the Frenchman Charles Maurras (who also hated Jews, Americans, and Marxists). He hates France\u2019s Third Republic to the point of supporting the Marxists in their desire to destroy it. He views himself as a supporter of \u201cLatin civilization\u201d over any particular nation, but also doesn\u2019t espouse any particular Catholic dogma.\n\nThere was, however, a tension between this kind of neo-pagan fascist and the clerical fascists. In Austria, conservative Catholics attacked a fascist internationalist journal for supporting neo-pagan doctrines. The journal tried to forestall this by emphasizing Mussolini\u2019s revulsion of Protestantism, and generally tried to tie the Church to fascism (they did, however, highlight the subordination of Catholic beliefs to concepts like Latinity).\n\n###Italian Efforts for International Fascism\n\nGiven that international fascism as depicted thus far draws heavily to supporting Italy, it\u2019s not a surprise that it had widespread support from Italian fascist politicians. Government sponsored groups and publications put forth this idea that fascism had clear international significance. \n\nHistorian Beate Scholz suggests this was all window dressing for consolidating Mussolini\u2019s own rule. As for Gottfried, he says a cynical perspective could conclude that Mussolini supported internationalism up to the moment it was no longer useful. After the invasion of Ethiopia and the alliance with Nazi Germany, he appealed to strict national interest and some racist ideology.\n\nIf we\u2019re willing to be more charitable, Mussolini actually engaged in tremendous support for internationalism. Il Duce himself noted the ties between the Roman Catholic Church and international fascism, for that matter. The Catholics, for their part, viewed the Italians as a political and moral arm of the Counter-Reformation. Asvero Gravelli, one who saw himself as \u201cthe architect of fascist internationalism\u201d, claimed that a giant battle would take place between East and West where the fascists would be the only ones to prevail in the name of Christ and against foreign forces. \n\n###Oswald Mosely\n\nThe biggest worker for the cause of international fascism was not Italian or even a Latin fascist, but apparently an English aristocrat named Oswald Mosely. He was an \u201cauthoritarian modernizer\u201d in the 1920s and 1930s and thoroughly determined to avoid a second European bloodbath. He went through several British political parties before creating his own fascist one.\n\nThe man wasn\u2019t just on the hook of Italy, multiple English aristocrats supported him in one way or another, though he also lost friends over his devotion to the fascist cause. His idea was simple: the Soviet experiment would only harm Britain if tried here, and parliamentary governments could not provide the decisive leadership needed. He courted Nazi Germany but wasn\u2019t so focused on identifying Jews as the enemy in Britain.\n\nOver that last point, he and his wife were claimed to be Nazi agents and imprisoned from 1940 to 1943, despite there being no evidence he ever received Nazi funds. After the war, one of his biographers claims he was highly active in continuing to push for European unity (now described as one nation), but this was not going to work when there was a much more powerful unity in the emerging European Community that was backed by the United States. Also, his programs were being offered by socialists, who weren\u2019t tainted by being on the right.\n\nDespite this picture of a man with tremendous energy, Oswald would die more or less a social outcast in 1980.\n\nIn a way, Mosely\u2019s fate matches that of fascism. He did well in the interwar period but nowhere else, and had his success rooted in Continental Europe. It didn\u2019t happen, of course. The BUF (Mosely\u2019s fascist party) did very poorly in the British elections and thoroughly lost to Labour. And in the post-WW2 era, all fascists carried the association of Nazism. \n\nBut what if they didn\u2019t carry that stigma? Would they have done better? Probably not, their economic programs weren\u2019t different enough from other parties, and their point of difference was a warning about Third World immigration, but that was a lost cause.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of whether fascism could ever be international in nature. Gottfried argues no, as while communism was universal at its core and that universalism was central to how the Bolsheviks built their government in the Soviet Union, fascist governments always saw internationalism as a secondary concern. Indeed, by the time the remaining fascist movements in Europe post-WW2 even got around to pledging to assist each other in making a fascist Europe, it was 1961 and the time had long since passed.\n\nTo summarize this chapter further:\n\n**Fascism had people who were dedicated to making an international export of it, but its movements were primarily focused on their own nations and didn\u2019t care that much about making a fascist international community. After WW2, they fell to the wayside as increasingly irrelevant and unable to escape the association with the Nazis.**\n\nI hope you enjoyed!

As is my custom, this piece uses Mormon as shorthand for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who express a preference to avoid the nickname. I usually do not make a note of it, but particularly in a piece like this in which I express deep gratitude for the LDS people in my life I want to emphasize that I use the shorthand out of longstanding personal appreciation for and familiarity with the term, not with intent to dismiss their faith or preferences.*)\n\nTo my surprise, my wedding day was the best day of my life.\n\nYes, yes, I know that's how people always said weddings were supposed to be. But I've never been much of one for big events, for ceremonies, for pomp and circumstance. While I've never been persuaded by messaging like [this](https://twitter.com/CountMoriarty/status/1560703561843056640), it's been a big part of the water in which I swim:\n\n&gt; Better option is not to have weddings at all and invite no one. Why pay tens of thousands of pounds for a single day when the marriage probably won't last and you won't see half of the relatives again. I can't think of a worse waste of money and time.\n\nSo much cost, so much fuss, so much demand for people to fly out and set time aside and dress up. The notion of an event inspired more tension than excitement for me, and my husband-to-be would just as soon have wandered into a courthouse one Saturday and called it a day. But I felt a sense of duty and one of ritual importance to bring friends and family together for a core moment in my life, particularly since I've been something of a nomad throughout my adulthood. I'm a latecomer to this sort of appreciation of tradition and ritual, at times willing to occupy forms without fully feeling the value of them. So I gritted my teeth and elected to prepare a traditional wedding over my own trepidation and the shrugs of the man I love\u2014or at least as traditional a wedding as is possible when one leaves the faith and culture of his ancestors and marries not the Mormon-woman-in-a-temple he had always been taught to plan for, but a man he stumbled across on a dating app.\n\nIt was an unusual event, but a joyous one\u2014not only for the chance to call the man I love my husband, but for the many friends and family members from various corners of my life who showed up to offer their support and love. I have lived an unusually fragmented life\u2014my childhood in Utah, my Mormon mission in Australia, my jumping from place to place for work, my pseudonymous writing and work online\u2014coming into and out of contact with a great many people I care deeply about, and my wedding provided the first chance I've ever really had to take people from those various fragments and give them a glimpse of the whole picture and the wonderful man that life has led me to. We married in front of an old mill in an aviary, under an arch with a Chinese double happiness sign hanging from it, our sisters standing by our sides as our ring-bearers and best men. Even the weather was generous to us, threatening rain all afternoon but providing only enough of a hint of it to shield us a bit from the August heat.\n\nI am a terrible planner in the best of circumstances, and I can't pretend my wedding planning was any less chaotic or slapdash than it would have been for any other event someone was unfortunate enough to put me in charge of. But there were a few key decisions I made, and many key decisions others made, that came together into a day more beautiful and perfect than I could have hoped. Given that, I feel a sort of responsibility both to write what I would have wanted to read about weddings for those who might find themselves in a similar spot (and, after all, who has not found themselves planning their own gay interracial marriage full of Mormons and weird online friends once or twice?) and to capture how the day felt for my own memories.\n\n###Inviting the Lads\n\nPeople often say the internet isn't real life, but I frankly see that as only so much cope. Pseudonyms or no, I have never been able to detach my online presence from who I am. No, I don't see people's faces, learn their names, or hear their voices online. Offline, though, I don't have nearly so many opportunities to take deep dives into topics I care about with people willing to respond in kind. You bare different parts of your soul in different places, and I place real value on the friendships I've built online. One of the earliest decisions I made with my wedding, then\u2014inspired in part by a friend whose face I saw for the first time when I flew out to his wedding\u2014was to invite a few groups of online friends.\n\nThe specific people came down to serendipity as much as anything. I wanted to limit my online invitations to groups rather than individuals to avoid pressuring people into a setting where they would know only me. Behind the public-facing internet, there exist secluded webs of conversation, stumbled into largely by chance, blossoming into occasional beauty with another roll of the dice. I've happened into several of those groups and grown particularly close with one or two, but am not sure they can genuinely be planned. Many I consider good friends or would love to have as friends happened to not be in one of these groups; prior attempts at forming similar societies emerged stillborn. I tossed group invitations into the abyss, and was happily astonished when some twenty online friends took me seriously and elected to attend, with most of them renting a grand mountain mansion for the weekend.\n\nI'll let one of them describe the weekend as a whole, should they choose to do so. For my part, I'll say that there's nothing quite like meeting good friends for the first time, suddenly matching real faces and real names with the formless thoughts and pseudonyms you've had countless conversations with. It's not often I have to guess which of my friends is which, with a pleasant mix of surprise and inevitability as each persona gets matched with a body\u2014of course that's how he would look and act. Their presence carried a sense of mystery and excitement through the weekend, a bridging of worlds that rarely have occasion to meet. Online conversations merged seamlessly into offline feasts and partying; family and friends with the good sense not to be terminally online got a glimpse of the internet misadventures that swallow so much of my time and the people I spend so much time writing alongside.\n\nIt was an unmitigated success, and I only wish I could have invited more. We even have engraved cups now, thanks to the ingenuity and generosity of one of the lads, and with them an implicit promise of many gatherings to come.\n\nOh, and I can assure you that [any rumors of \"weird cult nonsense\" at my bachelor party are wholly unfounded](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/730991434995597362/1009747007277121536/unknown.png).\n\n###The Whimsy Library\n\nNeither my husband nor I are particularly materialistic, and I have never been sold on the tradition of wedding registries full of household goods. When I need something, I get it; if I've been doing without, I prefer to keep doing without. I remember one friend's wedding with fondness in all regards save the thank-you note I got for giving them a [spiralizer](https://www.amazon.com/Spiralizer-Vegetable-Strongest-Heaviest-Gluten-Free/dp/B00GRIR87M) from their registry. I was glad to give a gift and wanted it to be worthwhile for them, but I can't pretend to any sentimental feelings towards spiralizers.\n\nWe would have been happy to forego gifts altogether, but my instinct was and is that many people value gift-giving as a part of the ritual of weddings, in a way that \"No gifts, please\" and \"In lieu of gifts, please consider making a donation on our behalf\" (while understandable options) don't quite capture. To bridge that tension, I settled on perhaps my favorite personal decision for the wedding: in lieu of traditional gifts, we asked each guest who wanted to provide a gift to bring a book they thought we should have and expected nobody else to bring. \n\nThis made each gift fascinating, personal, and charming: books that served as reminders of inside jokes, or the connections that drew us to the people present, a catalogue of people's favorites or a mirror of how they saw us. Beautifully bound stories to read with our future kids, cookbooks with cuisine holding personal meaning to the givers, a comic with a panel I quote to anyone who will listen, and all throughout peppered with heartfelt and moving reminders of those who gave them to us. I hope to catalogue the full Whimsy Library soon and expect it to remain a treasure in our home throughout our lives.\n\n###The Mormons and the Gays\n\nOn my wedding day, I learned that two more of my young cousins have elected to begin gender transitions\u2014and that the two girls I went on dates with in high school now date women themselves. I got to welcome a friend whose groomsman I had been and now-her wife, having gone from their once-straight wedding at a Mormon temple to my gay one at an aviary. With them, I got to see my uncle, remarried to a man\u2014which I only learned when I announced my own engagement on Facebook\u2014and my older brother, once married in a Mormon temple before joining me outside the faith. All of us grew up deeply enmeshed in Mormon faith and culture. All of us now find ourselves navigating peculiar new pathways opened to us by shifting cultural tides.\n\nAlongside them, I was deeply grateful to welcome dozens of active Mormons among my family and friends: grandparents, aunts and uncles, parents, my younger siblings, childhood neighbors and longtime friends. One neighbor in particular, who I had lived next door to through my whole childhood from the day he was born, was gracious enough to stop by less than a month before he heads out on his own Mormon mission. Many of my family and friends are devout, whether via strict adherence to Mormon orthodoxy or a determination to find a pathway forward within the faith through and around their own questions. \n\nI owe a great debt to the communitarian bonds and the social fabric of my erstwhile faith, a debt apparent throughout the planning and execution of the wedding. The photographer was a friend of my dad's from church, the wedding planner a church friend of my mom's. Rather than rent linens, we borrowed them from the local church woman's organization my mom leads as a volunteer. At every step, I relied heavily on my parents' help. As I say above, I am a poor and slapdash planner at best; without my parents' selfless, tireless efforts and their ties within their Mormon communities, I cannot imagine the wedding having gone nearly so well. Even standing outside my own tradition, I inevitably lean on it.\n\nUnderstand this: I know perfectly well the precarity of my position. I stepped away from Mormonism deliberately, after careful consideration, and without regret. The life path I have chosen is now fundamentally incompatible with its tenets. There is no telling of my life and family story that does not entail, on some level, a sense of brokenness and tragedy. From the faithful perspective, I am a determinedly wayward sheep who has brazenly abandoned the path to eternal happiness. From my own, the foundation of my culture\u2014the path my family has devoted their lives to for as long as it has been a path to follow\u2014is a scintillating mirage woven from the imagination of a man determined to sweep the world into a story of his invention. Neither I nor, I suspect, my family members can view the picture of my family and my once-neighborhood without a lurking hint of sorrow.\n\nMormonism is not an aggressive faith, for the most part. It's been years since someone has seen a need to condemn my pathway to my face, and even those who did those years ago tried to do so from a place of love. You learn from the invitations left unanswered and the messages left unsent which of your loved ones no longer know how to fit you into their worlds. Most of the time, those bridges had been neglected and [left slowly falling into disrepair](https://pics.me.me/i-dont-burn-bridges-i-just-fail-to-maintain-them-59717779.png) regardless, but some of the silences do sting.\n\nBut we persist. I hug my friend and wish him well on his journey to spread the message of Joseph Smith; he hugs me back and wishes me well in a marriage even Joseph Smith could not have imagined. I hug my grandparents and they welcome my husband into their family and into their prayers. I hug my little cousins, who I watch choosing new names and new clothing, and find that it's my turn to fret as I see them entering paths to more complicated and\u2014I fear\u2014less peaceful lives. We take family pictures and have family dinners and enjoy each other's presence on that rare occasion we have all had an excuse to travel to the same spot. We embrace the moments we get, even knowing the contradictions that underlie them.\n\nI can't help but think of the musical Fiddler on the Roof as I watch the continued development of my family and childhood friends. This tension between traditional communities and sweeping modernity is not, itself, a new experience. The story of an orthodox Jew watching his daughters marry outside his tradition around the turn of the 20th century repeats with Mormon parents watching their son marry a man in the 21st, and has repeated many times and many places. Perhaps this, too, is tradition. \n\nThere is an inherent tension in this position, one that can never wholly depart. But life has always been full of tension, and people have always found a way towards beauty regardless. I do not need to resolve the impossible to appreciate celebrating my wedding day alongside the Mormons I love, nor they to celebrate with me. They are there in the moments that matter to me; I aspire to be there in those that matter to them\u2014finding our own triumphs, making our own mistakes, and building what we can. \n\nThe hint of tragedy is inevitable, but I am extraordinarily lucky. The Mormons in my life have always been uncommonly good to me. My family and friends were unreserved in showing their support for my husband and me at our wedding. A gay wedding full of Mormons is a peculiar thing, but it was a gift I will cherish.\n\n###A Word on Words\n\nThat's enough of the bittersweet. It's something I wanted to address, but the moment was one of joy, and I don't mean to summon a cloud that was not present.\n\nInstead, I want to talk about that most dreaded of occasions, the wedding toast: the moment when someone stands up to talk and the crowded room waits with bated breath to find whether they've subscribed to ten minutes of loose rambling or a tightly prepared minute or two of charming memories. I can't objectively say whether the guests who gave toasts were uncommonly good at the task or whether my husband and I were just primed to love everything they said\u2014and certainly that played a part\u2014but the toasts linger in my heart.\n\nWe chose three speakers each, all from disparate corners of our lives: our sisters who could speak to our upbringings, my childhood friend who saw more of my development than almost anyone else, my husband's college friend who came with a group of seven others from the same storied dorm, a representative for my weird online friends who could speak a bit to my peculiar double life, and finally a couple my husband works alongside\u2014friends of ours who were perhaps the only people there to really know us as a couple.\n\nWhile we hung on every word they had to say, I suspect even those long-suffering readers who have read this far would be less eager than I am to hear a blow-by-blow of each toast. I will focus on only two moments, points where the speakers had prepared long before they could have known they would have wedding toasts to give.\n\nMy husband's college friend, it turns out, put me to shame, collecting all of the embarrassing stories about my husband of the sort I should be inflicting on others. Here are a few of the ones he shared at the wedding:\n\n* My husband has some peculiar eating habits, from a pathological fear of salt to an inhumanly large appetite\u2014he tends to eat dinner out of a mixing bowl. Rather than gorge himself to obesity, though, he instead eats more vegetables than any man alive. As his friend told it, he would grab a twelve-ounce bag of frozen broccoli each night and have it alongside whatever he ate, but planned poorly and found himself without broccoli during a storm at one point. Not content to go without for a night, he marched through a storm to the nearest grocery store, grabbed his broccoli, and returned triumphant with his feast. He has since upgraded his approach, adding a bag of green beans to that bag of broccoli every night. Even after a four-course meal at our local reception the other night, he ate his beans and broccoli. But I digress.\n\n* Given the choice between a familiar restaurant and something new, my husband will pick the unusual option every time. It was no surprise, then, when he insisted on dragging his friends to a Japanese restaurant with some odd options one time they travelled to another city. Asian food, he had insisted, was what he was in the mood for, so they obliged. Upon arriving at the restaurant, he glanced at the menu and promptly ordered, ah, a hamburger. He maintains it was justified because the burger had wagyu beef, but his friends were not impressed.\n\n* A couple of times, my husband got, well, a bit mixed up about objects or locations. He pulled the friend excitedly down to the kitchen to eat mangoes one day\u2014oddly round and fuzzy mangoes, that is, with wrinkled pits. Some of us know them as peaches. Another time, he had begun to fixate on Taiwan, expressing interest in visiting or trying more of their delicious food\u2014you know, pad thai and massaman curry and the like. Since then, he's cleared up the difference between Taiwan and Thailand, and evidently first experimented with making his (excellent) Thai curries at that time, so it all seems to have worked out.\n\nAlways keep a running tab of embarrassing stories about your friends in case they ask you to toast at their weddings. Their spouses will thank you.\n\nAs for me, I was doing alright keeping my tears in check at the wedding right up until my sister's toast. But she ambushed me. Her whole toast was deeply personal and moving. I won't embarrass her by repeating all the too-kind things she said about me, but my account of the night wouldn't be complete if I didn't mention the paper she quoted in the toast and handed to me after it. \n\nWhen she was twelve\u2014as I learned during her wedding-day toast\u2014on a school assignment to write about an important person in her life, she chose to write about me. I don't know that another piece of writing can ever move me as much as that school essay, presciently noticed and saved by my mom, did. I'll quote only a few excerpts:\n\n&gt; Without [Trace] [...] there would be a huge void in our lives. He is our troubled genius. [...] He could be anything he wanted to be, if he chose; but there is nothing he wants to be. [...] [Trace] listens to me when I need it, and gives advice. Yet sometimes I think he is the one who needs advice, who needs comfort. He has a hard time at school, often. He doesn't always get along with teachers. I wish I could help him. I wish I could make things easier for him\u2014he is so smart, but he has a hard time. However, I trust him and hope for him to come out on top. I love my brother [Trace].\n\nShe ambushed me with that. *At my wedding.* Then she went on to note, rightly, how amazing my husband is and how good he has been for me. I sobbed.\n\nShe wasn't wrong to note that I was a deeply unhappy teenager\u2014it took me close to a decade after she wrote that assignment to really come into my own. Her life, between then and now, has been much rougher than she or anyone deserves. I was terrified while I was in Australia that I would come home to the news that she was no longer with us. But she, too, has come into her own. You should have seen her, there at the wedding. She was magnificent, wholly in her element, for once attending an event at a place she's helped host events for years. She prepared much of the decoration, she helped lead setup, she directed the guests. And then she ambushed me with *that*. \n\nIt's hardly fair.\n\n###The Vows Under the Arch\n\nAs I planned this wedding, the recollections and advice of my friend Gemma in particular lingered in my mind, perhaps nowhere more so than in [her thoughts on vows](https://gemcode.dreamwidth.org/3637.html). That essay shapes and reflects my own thoughts on the value and limits of tradition\u2014\"We can shop around, make alterations, import the wisdom of our ancestors where it seems good and quietly ignore it when it seems bad\"\u2014and I referred back to it regularly when thinking about my own vows to my new husband. In the end, this was my vow, paired with a few sentences to express my love:\n\n&gt; I take you to be my lawfully wedded husband and the companion of my heart\u2014to have and to hold from this day forward, in joy and in sorrow, in strength and in weakness, in sickness and in health, to grow together and to build together, as long as we both shall exist.\n\nI opted to depart from the traditional form more than Gemma did, choosing words that evoked it without fully occupying it, before shifting more fully towards my own form at the end. The nods towards growth and building reflect my own preoccupations, capturing the image of marriage I hope to live up to\u2014one where the image of being perfect just as one is gets set aside for one of mutual determination towards progress towards what one could be. \n\nIn Mormon tradition and faith, marriages are \"for time and all eternity\" instead of \"until death do us part.\" While I can no longer claim an authentic stake in that, its memory echoes in my mind and makes me flinch away from phrasing that implies a time to part. I cannot claim to believe I will exist for eternity unless humanity learns to wrest its eternal survival from an uncaring world, but I have always taken marriage to be a commitment with no expiry. My phrasing (\"as long as we both shall exist\") was the best I could find to convey that.\n\nMy writing online has always been personal, but it feels somehow more so to talk about just what my husband means to me. Still, it would hardly do to write a wedding post without trying to capture a bit about the man whose name I took through it and the path that led me to him. \n\nThere was no point in my life when I was a closeted gay man. Rather, I thought of myself as both incapable of falling in love and uninterested in it until around the time I stepped away from Mormonism, and frankly wondered if I would remain cut off from that core human experience forever. Noticing my own attraction to men after I left Mormonism, then, came as a profound relief to me\u2014finally, a chance at love\u2014and I never had a reason to obscure it. Even then, though, the core of loneliness and the fear that I was somehow unlovable\u2014at least in a romantic sense\u2014remained.\n\nFrom the day I met my husband, being with him has felt vital and wholly right. I remember watching him take a silly personality quiz for me on one of our earlier dates and getting my every answer right, remember slowly opening up about every one of my peculiarities and flaws, remember his unconditional and immediate love for me both despite and because of a precise view of me. I remember him asking permission to hug on our first date so cautiously that I couldn't be sure he was even looking for more than a friend, remember the home-cooked Korean food and the kiss he politely offered me on our second date, remember my slowly dawning conviction I had found someone extraordinary. I remember the way, almost immediately, that loneliness faded, replaced with a conviction that I needed him by my side.\n\nIt's not that we're identical, or even close to it. It would be a colossal error for me to date someone too like myself. We are instead consciously complementary. He is prudent where I am adventurous, particular where I am laid back, practical where I am idealistic. He tells me stories of the patients he sees and the research he works on, I rant wildly to him about whichever peculiar topic has seized hold of my mind. He goes to bed between 10 and 11 every night he can manage, while I hunch over a keyboard writing until odd hours of the morning every night I don't let him drag me towards a healthier schedule. You are unlikely to see him post much, if ever, online, and with that he anchors me in reality. I feel whole alongside him and can imagine no one I would rather raise a family alongside. \n\nI love him dearly. I am his, now and always. \n\n###Conclusion\n\nI'd ask you to forgive the saccharine overload, but you are, after all, reading a wedding essay. It comes with the territory. It's obvious in retrospect why the wedding meant so much to me, but I suppose some things need to be experienced firsthand to be understood. There's more I could go into\u2014more I will go into, really, in the thank-you notes I'm still scrambling to write and the conversations I will continue to have. But this is more than enough for now. \n\nI am, in the end, thrilled to rest and to be done with that weekend. As much as anything else, a wedding carries a sense of duty\u2014to your partner, of course, but just as much to the attendees who spend money and time to celebrate with you. I am not particularly outgoing by nature, but I committed during that weekend to spend as much time as possible with those who had come a long way to be present\u2014whirling between conversations and events and friends and families and responsibilities. It was worth the effort\u2014every bit of it, broadly against my expectations, was worth the effort\u2014but it is an effort I am in no hurry to repeat.\n\nMy wedding was beautiful, the sort of storybook wedding children-who-are-not-me dream of, the sort I never planned on or anticipated. I knew I wanted to defy my natural inclination and manifest a ritual that would invite friends and family to see the man I love. From that, despite my own chaotic and sporadic planning, those friends and family wove a gift I cannot help but treasure. For the first time in my life, the scattered fragments of my history and personality came together into a cohesive whole, a moment of being seen as I aim to be, next to the man I am honored to be with. My heart is full.\n\nThese are the joyous times. \n\nThank you for reading.\n\n*Originally posted [here](https://tracingwoodgrains.substack.com/p/a-gay-wedding-full-of-mormons), with a few more pictures*", "author_fullname": "t2_eu1v4dp", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Gay Wedding Full of Mormons: My account of my wedding day", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wvsaly", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 68, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": "991bceb0-301f-11e9-a749-0ed81f530880", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 68, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661269857.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;n.b. As is my custom, this piece uses Mormon as shorthand for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who express a preference to avoid the nickname. I usually do not make a note of it, but particularly in a piece like this in which I express deep gratitude for the LDS people in my life I want to emphasize that I use the shorthand out of longstanding personal appreciation for and familiarity with the term, not with intent to dismiss their faith or preferences.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, my wedding day was the best day of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, I know that&amp;#39;s how people always said weddings were supposed to be. But I&amp;#39;ve never been much of one for big events, for ceremonies, for pomp and circumstance. While I&amp;#39;ve never been persuaded by messaging like &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/CountMoriarty/status/1560703561843056640\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s been a big part of the water in which I swim:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Better option is not to have weddings at all and invite no one. Why pay tens of thousands of pounds for a single day when the marriage probably won&amp;#39;t last and you won&amp;#39;t see half of the relatives again. I can&amp;#39;t think of a worse waste of money and time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So much cost, so much fuss, so much demand for people to fly out and set time aside and dress up. The notion of an event inspired more tension than excitement for me, and my husband-to-be would just as soon have wandered into a courthouse one Saturday and called it a day. But I felt a sense of duty and one of ritual importance to bring friends and family together for a core moment in my life, particularly since I&amp;#39;ve been something of a nomad throughout my adulthood. I&amp;#39;m a latecomer to this sort of appreciation of tradition and ritual, at times willing to occupy forms without fully feeling the value of them. So I gritted my teeth and elected to prepare a traditional wedding over my own trepidation and the shrugs of the man I love\u2014or at least as traditional a wedding as is possible when one leaves the faith and culture of his ancestors and marries not the Mormon-woman-in-a-temple he had always been taught to plan for, but a man he stumbled across on a dating app.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an unusual event, but a joyous one\u2014not only for the chance to call the man I love my husband, but for the many friends and family members from various corners of my life who showed up to offer their support and love. I have lived an unusually fragmented life\u2014my childhood in Utah, my Mormon mission in Australia, my jumping from place to place for work, my pseudonymous writing and work online\u2014coming into and out of contact with a great many people I care deeply about, and my wedding provided the first chance I&amp;#39;ve ever really had to take people from those various fragments and give them a glimpse of the whole picture and the wonderful man that life has led me to. We married in front of an old mill in an aviary, under an arch with a Chinese double happiness sign hanging from it, our sisters standing by our sides as our ring-bearers and best men. Even the weather was generous to us, threatening rain all afternoon but providing only enough of a hint of it to shield us a bit from the August heat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a terrible planner in the best of circumstances, and I can&amp;#39;t pretend my wedding planning was any less chaotic or slapdash than it would have been for any other event someone was unfortunate enough to put me in charge of. But there were a few key decisions I made, and many key decisions others made, that came together into a day more beautiful and perfect than I could have hoped. Given that, I feel a sort of responsibility both to write what I would have wanted to read about weddings for those who might find themselves in a similar spot (and, after all, who has not found themselves planning their own gay interracial marriage full of Mormons and weird online friends once or twice?) and to capture how the day felt for my own memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Inviting the Lads&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People often say the internet isn&amp;#39;t real life, but I frankly see that as only so much cope. Pseudonyms or no, I have never been able to detach my online presence from who I am. No, I don&amp;#39;t see people&amp;#39;s faces, learn their names, or hear their voices online. Offline, though, I don&amp;#39;t have nearly so many opportunities to take deep dives into topics I care about with people willing to respond in kind. You bare different parts of your soul in different places, and I place real value on the friendships I&amp;#39;ve built online. One of the earliest decisions I made with my wedding, then\u2014inspired in part by a friend whose face I saw for the first time when I flew out to his wedding\u2014was to invite a few groups of online friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The specific people came down to serendipity as much as anything. I wanted to limit my online invitations to groups rather than individuals to avoid pressuring people into a setting where they would know only me. Behind the public-facing internet, there exist secluded webs of conversation, stumbled into largely by chance, blossoming into occasional beauty with another roll of the dice. I&amp;#39;ve happened into several of those groups and grown particularly close with one or two, but am not sure they can genuinely be planned. Many I consider good friends or would love to have as friends happened to not be in one of these groups; prior attempts at forming similar societies emerged stillborn. I tossed group invitations into the abyss, and was happily astonished when some twenty online friends took me seriously and elected to attend, with most of them renting a grand mountain mansion for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll let one of them describe the weekend as a whole, should they choose to do so. For my part, I&amp;#39;ll say that there&amp;#39;s nothing quite like meeting good friends for the first time, suddenly matching real faces and real names with the formless thoughts and pseudonyms you&amp;#39;ve had countless conversations with. It&amp;#39;s not often I have to guess which of my friends is which, with a pleasant mix of surprise and inevitability as each persona gets matched with a body\u2014of course that&amp;#39;s how he would look and act. Their presence carried a sense of mystery and excitement through the weekend, a bridging of worlds that rarely have occasion to meet. Online conversations merged seamlessly into offline feasts and partying; family and friends with the good sense not to be terminally online got a glimpse of the internet misadventures that swallow so much of my time and the people I spend so much time writing alongside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an unmitigated success, and I only wish I could have invited more. We even have engraved cups now, thanks to the ingenuity and generosity of one of the lads, and with them an implicit promise of many gatherings to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I can assure you that &lt;a href=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/730991434995597362/1009747007277121536/unknown.png\"&gt;any rumors of &amp;quot;weird cult nonsense&amp;quot; at my bachelor party are wholly unfounded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Whimsy Library&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither my husband nor I are particularly materialistic, and I have never been sold on the tradition of wedding registries full of household goods. When I need something, I get it; if I&amp;#39;ve been doing without, I prefer to keep doing without. I remember one friend&amp;#39;s wedding with fondness in all regards save the thank-you note I got for giving them a &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spiralizer-Vegetable-Strongest-Heaviest-Gluten-Free/dp/B00GRIR87M\"&gt;spiralizer&lt;/a&gt; from their registry. I was glad to give a gift and wanted it to be worthwhile for them, but I can&amp;#39;t pretend to any sentimental feelings towards spiralizers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would have been happy to forego gifts altogether, but my instinct was and is that many people value gift-giving as a part of the ritual of weddings, in a way that &amp;quot;No gifts, please&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;In lieu of gifts, please consider making a donation on our behalf&amp;quot; (while understandable options) don&amp;#39;t quite capture. To bridge that tension, I settled on perhaps my favorite personal decision for the wedding: in lieu of traditional gifts, we asked each guest who wanted to provide a gift to bring a book they thought we should have and expected nobody else to bring. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This made each gift fascinating, personal, and charming: books that served as reminders of inside jokes, or the connections that drew us to the people present, a catalogue of people&amp;#39;s favorites or a mirror of how they saw us. Beautifully bound stories to read with our future kids, cookbooks with cuisine holding personal meaning to the givers, a comic with a panel I quote to anyone who will listen, and all throughout peppered with heartfelt and moving reminders of those who gave them to us. I hope to catalogue the full Whimsy Library soon and expect it to remain a treasure in our home throughout our lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Mormons and the Gays&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On my wedding day, I learned that two more of my young cousins have elected to begin gender transitions\u2014and that the two girls I went on dates with in high school now date women themselves. I got to welcome a friend whose groomsman I had been and now-her wife, having gone from their once-straight wedding at a Mormon temple to my gay one at an aviary. With them, I got to see my uncle, remarried to a man\u2014which I only learned when I announced my own engagement on Facebook\u2014and my older brother, once married in a Mormon temple before joining me outside the faith. All of us grew up deeply enmeshed in Mormon faith and culture. All of us now find ourselves navigating peculiar new pathways opened to us by shifting cultural tides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alongside them, I was deeply grateful to welcome dozens of active Mormons among my family and friends: grandparents, aunts and uncles, parents, my younger siblings, childhood neighbors and longtime friends. One neighbor in particular, who I had lived next door to through my whole childhood from the day he was born, was gracious enough to stop by less than a month before he heads out on his own Mormon mission. Many of my family and friends are devout, whether via strict adherence to Mormon orthodoxy or a determination to find a pathway forward within the faith through and around their own questions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I owe a great debt to the communitarian bonds and the social fabric of my erstwhile faith, a debt apparent throughout the planning and execution of the wedding. The photographer was a friend of my dad&amp;#39;s from church, the wedding planner a church friend of my mom&amp;#39;s. Rather than rent linens, we borrowed them from the local church woman&amp;#39;s organization my mom leads as a volunteer. At every step, I relied heavily on my parents&amp;#39; help. As I say above, I am a poor and slapdash planner at best; without my parents&amp;#39; selfless, tireless efforts and their ties within their Mormon communities, I cannot imagine the wedding having gone nearly so well. Even standing outside my own tradition, I inevitably lean on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understand this: I know perfectly well the precarity of my position. I stepped away from Mormonism deliberately, after careful consideration, and without regret. The life path I have chosen is now fundamentally incompatible with its tenets. There is no telling of my life and family story that does not entail, on some level, a sense of brokenness and tragedy. From the faithful perspective, I am a determinedly wayward sheep who has brazenly abandoned the path to eternal happiness. From my own, the foundation of my culture\u2014the path my family has devoted their lives to for as long as it has been a path to follow\u2014is a scintillating mirage woven from the imagination of a man determined to sweep the world into a story of his invention. Neither I nor, I suspect, my family members can view the picture of my family and my once-neighborhood without a lurking hint of sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mormonism is not an aggressive faith, for the most part. It&amp;#39;s been years since someone has seen a need to condemn my pathway to my face, and even those who did those years ago tried to do so from a place of love. You learn from the invitations left unanswered and the messages left unsent which of your loved ones no longer know how to fit you into their worlds. Most of the time, those bridges had been neglected and &lt;a href=\"https://pics.me.me/i-dont-burn-bridges-i-just-fail-to-maintain-them-59717779.png\"&gt;left slowly falling into disrepair&lt;/a&gt; regardless, but some of the silences do sting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we persist. I hug my friend and wish him well on his journey to spread the message of Joseph Smith; he hugs me back and wishes me well in a marriage even Joseph Smith could not have imagined. I hug my grandparents and they welcome my husband into their family and into their prayers. I hug my little cousins, who I watch choosing new names and new clothing, and find that it&amp;#39;s my turn to fret as I see them entering paths to more complicated and\u2014I fear\u2014less peaceful lives. We take family pictures and have family dinners and enjoy each other&amp;#39;s presence on that rare occasion we have all had an excuse to travel to the same spot. We embrace the moments we get, even knowing the contradictions that underlie them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but think of the musical Fiddler on the Roof as I watch the continued development of my family and childhood friends. This tension between traditional communities and sweeping modernity is not, itself, a new experience. The story of an orthodox Jew watching his daughters marry outside his tradition around the turn of the 20th century repeats with Mormon parents watching their son marry a man in the 21st, and has repeated many times and many places. Perhaps this, too, is tradition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is an inherent tension in this position, one that can never wholly depart. But life has always been full of tension, and people have always found a way towards beauty regardless. I do not need to resolve the impossible to appreciate celebrating my wedding day alongside the Mormons I love, nor they to celebrate with me. They are there in the moments that matter to me; I aspire to be there in those that matter to them\u2014finding our own triumphs, making our own mistakes, and building what we can. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hint of tragedy is inevitable, but I am extraordinarily lucky. The Mormons in my life have always been uncommonly good to me. My family and friends were unreserved in showing their support for my husband and me at our wedding. A gay wedding full of Mormons is a peculiar thing, but it was a gift I will cherish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;A Word on Words&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s enough of the bittersweet. It&amp;#39;s something I wanted to address, but the moment was one of joy, and I don&amp;#39;t mean to summon a cloud that was not present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I want to talk about that most dreaded of occasions, the wedding toast: the moment when someone stands up to talk and the crowded room waits with bated breath to find whether they&amp;#39;ve subscribed to ten minutes of loose rambling or a tightly prepared minute or two of charming memories. I can&amp;#39;t objectively say whether the guests who gave toasts were uncommonly good at the task or whether my husband and I were just primed to love everything they said\u2014and certainly that played a part\u2014but the toasts linger in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We chose three speakers each, all from disparate corners of our lives: our sisters who could speak to our upbringings, my childhood friend who saw more of my development than almost anyone else, my husband&amp;#39;s college friend who came with a group of seven others from the same storied dorm, a representative for my weird online friends who could speak a bit to my peculiar double life, and finally a couple my husband works alongside\u2014friends of ours who were perhaps the only people there to really know us as a couple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While we hung on every word they had to say, I suspect even those long-suffering readers who have read this far would be less eager than I am to hear a blow-by-blow of each toast. I will focus on only two moments, points where the speakers had prepared long before they could have known they would have wedding toasts to give.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband&amp;#39;s college friend, it turns out, put me to shame, collecting all of the embarrassing stories about my husband of the sort I should be inflicting on others. Here are a few of the ones he shared at the wedding:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband has some peculiar eating habits, from a pathological fear of salt to an inhumanly large appetite\u2014he tends to eat dinner out of a mixing bowl. Rather than gorge himself to obesity, though, he instead eats more vegetables than any man alive. As his friend told it, he would grab a twelve-ounce bag of frozen broccoli each night and have it alongside whatever he ate, but planned poorly and found himself without broccoli during a storm at one point. Not content to go without for a night, he marched through a storm to the nearest grocery store, grabbed his broccoli, and returned triumphant with his feast. He has since upgraded his approach, adding a bag of green beans to that bag of broccoli every night. Even after a four-course meal at our local reception the other night, he ate his beans and broccoli. But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the choice between a familiar restaurant and something new, my husband will pick the unusual option every time. It was no surprise, then, when he insisted on dragging his friends to a Japanese restaurant with some odd options one time they travelled to another city. Asian food, he had insisted, was what he was in the mood for, so they obliged. Upon arriving at the restaurant, he glanced at the menu and promptly ordered, ah, a hamburger. He maintains it was justified because the burger had wagyu beef, but his friends were not impressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of times, my husband got, well, a bit mixed up about objects or locations. He pulled the friend excitedly down to the kitchen to eat mangoes one day\u2014oddly round and fuzzy mangoes, that is, with wrinkled pits. Some of us know them as peaches. Another time, he had begun to fixate on Taiwan, expressing interest in visiting or trying more of their delicious food\u2014you know, pad thai and massaman curry and the like. Since then, he&amp;#39;s cleared up the difference between Taiwan and Thailand, and evidently first experimented with making his (excellent) Thai curries at that time, so it all seems to have worked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always keep a running tab of embarrassing stories about your friends in case they ask you to toast at their weddings. Their spouses will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for me, I was doing alright keeping my tears in check at the wedding right up until my sister&amp;#39;s toast. But she ambushed me. Her whole toast was deeply personal and moving. I won&amp;#39;t embarrass her by repeating all the too-kind things she said about me, but my account of the night wouldn&amp;#39;t be complete if I didn&amp;#39;t mention the paper she quoted in the toast and handed to me after it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she was twelve\u2014as I learned during her wedding-day toast\u2014on a school assignment to write about an important person in her life, she chose to write about me. I don&amp;#39;t know that another piece of writing can ever move me as much as that school essay, presciently noticed and saved by my mom, did. I&amp;#39;ll quote only a few excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Without [Trace] [...] there would be a huge void in our lives. He is our troubled genius. [...] He could be anything he wanted to be, if he chose; but there is nothing he wants to be. [...] [Trace] listens to me when I need it, and gives advice. Yet sometimes I think he is the one who needs advice, who needs comfort. He has a hard time at school, often. He doesn&amp;#39;t always get along with teachers. I wish I could help him. I wish I could make things easier for him\u2014he is so smart, but he has a hard time. However, I trust him and hope for him to come out on top. I love my brother [Trace].&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She ambushed me with that. &lt;em&gt;At my wedding.&lt;/em&gt; Then she went on to note, rightly, how amazing my husband is and how good he has been for me. I sobbed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wasn&amp;#39;t wrong to note that I was a deeply unhappy teenager\u2014it took me close to a decade after she wrote that assignment to really come into my own. Her life, between then and now, has been much rougher than she or anyone deserves. I was terrified while I was in Australia that I would come home to the news that she was no longer with us. But she, too, has come into her own. You should have seen her, there at the wedding. She was magnificent, wholly in her element, for once attending an event at a place she&amp;#39;s helped host events for years. She prepared much of the decoration, she helped lead setup, she directed the guests. And then she ambushed me with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hardly fair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Vows Under the Arch&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I planned this wedding, the recollections and advice of my friend Gemma in particular lingered in my mind, perhaps nowhere more so than in &lt;a href=\"https://gemcode.dreamwidth.org/3637.html\"&gt;her thoughts on vows&lt;/a&gt;. That essay shapes and reflects my own thoughts on the value and limits of tradition\u2014&amp;quot;We can shop around, make alterations, import the wisdom of our ancestors where it seems good and quietly ignore it when it seems bad&amp;quot;\u2014and I referred back to it regularly when thinking about my own vows to my new husband. In the end, this was my vow, paired with a few sentences to express my love:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I take you to be my lawfully wedded husband and the companion of my heart\u2014to have and to hold from this day forward, in joy and in sorrow, in strength and in weakness, in sickness and in health, to grow together and to build together, as long as we both shall exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I opted to depart from the traditional form more than Gemma did, choosing words that evoked it without fully occupying it, before shifting more fully towards my own form at the end. The nods towards growth and building reflect my own preoccupations, capturing the image of marriage I hope to live up to\u2014one where the image of being perfect just as one is gets set aside for one of mutual determination towards progress towards what one could be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Mormon tradition and faith, marriages are &amp;quot;for time and all eternity&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;until death do us part.&amp;quot; While I can no longer claim an authentic stake in that, its memory echoes in my mind and makes me flinch away from phrasing that implies a time to part. I cannot claim to believe I will exist for eternity unless humanity learns to wrest its eternal survival from an uncaring world, but I have always taken marriage to be a commitment with no expiry. My phrasing (&amp;quot;as long as we both shall exist&amp;quot;) was the best I could find to convey that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My writing online has always been personal, but it feels somehow more so to talk about just what my husband means to me. Still, it would hardly do to write a wedding post without trying to capture a bit about the man whose name I took through it and the path that led me to him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no point in my life when I was a closeted gay man. Rather, I thought of myself as both incapable of falling in love and uninterested in it until around the time I stepped away from Mormonism, and frankly wondered if I would remain cut off from that core human experience forever. Noticing my own attraction to men after I left Mormonism, then, came as a profound relief to me\u2014finally, a chance at love\u2014and I never had a reason to obscure it. Even then, though, the core of loneliness and the fear that I was somehow unlovable\u2014at least in a romantic sense\u2014remained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the day I met my husband, being with him has felt vital and wholly right. I remember watching him take a silly personality quiz for me on one of our earlier dates and getting my every answer right, remember slowly opening up about every one of my peculiarities and flaws, remember his unconditional and immediate love for me both despite and because of a precise view of me. I remember him asking permission to hug on our first date so cautiously that I couldn&amp;#39;t be sure he was even looking for more than a friend, remember the home-cooked Korean food and the kiss he politely offered me on our second date, remember my slowly dawning conviction I had found someone extraordinary. I remember the way, almost immediately, that loneliness faded, replaced with a conviction that I needed him by my side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that we&amp;#39;re identical, or even close to it. It would be a colossal error for me to date someone too like myself. We are instead consciously complementary. He is prudent where I am adventurous, particular where I am laid back, practical where I am idealistic. He tells me stories of the patients he sees and the research he works on, I rant wildly to him about whichever peculiar topic has seized hold of my mind. He goes to bed between 10 and 11 every night he can manage, while I hunch over a keyboard writing until odd hours of the morning every night I don&amp;#39;t let him drag me towards a healthier schedule. You are unlikely to see him post much, if ever, online, and with that he anchors me in reality. I feel whole alongside him and can imagine no one I would rather raise a family alongside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love him dearly. I am his, now and always. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d ask you to forgive the saccharine overload, but you are, after all, reading a wedding essay. It comes with the territory. It&amp;#39;s obvious in retrospect why the wedding meant so much to me, but I suppose some things need to be experienced firsthand to be understood. There&amp;#39;s more I could go into\u2014more I will go into, really, in the thank-you notes I&amp;#39;m still scrambling to write and the conversations I will continue to have. But this is more than enough for now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am, in the end, thrilled to rest and to be done with that weekend. As much as anything else, a wedding carries a sense of duty\u2014to your partner, of course, but just as much to the attendees who spend money and time to celebrate with you. I am not particularly outgoing by nature, but I committed during that weekend to spend as much time as possible with those who had come a long way to be present\u2014whirling between conversations and events and friends and families and responsibilities. It was worth the effort\u2014every bit of it, broadly against my expectations, was worth the effort\u2014but it is an effort I am in no hurry to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wedding was beautiful, the sort of storybook wedding children-who-are-not-me dream of, the sort I never planned on or anticipated. I knew I wanted to defy my natural inclination and manifest a ritual that would invite friends and family to see the man I love. From that, despite my own chaotic and sporadic planning, those friends and family wove a gift I cannot help but treasure. For the first time in my life, the scattered fragments of my history and personality came together into a cohesive whole, a moment of being seen as I aim to be, next to the man I am honored to be with. My heart is full.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are the joyous times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=\"https://tracingwoodgrains.substack.com/p/a-gay-wedding-full-of-mormons\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with a few more pictures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "First, do no harm", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "wvsaly", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TracingWoodgrains", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 66, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wvsaly/a_gay_wedding_full_of_mormons_my_account_of_my/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wvsaly/a_gay_wedding_full_of_mormons_my_account_of_my/", "subreddit_subscribers": 18603, "created_utc": 1661269857.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "selftext": "This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts.

This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh).

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 15, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wos3do", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 39, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 39, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1660544108.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

I\u2019ve tried to read Fountainhead once, but previously made it probably halfway through. However, I have read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, and some of Rand\u2019s non-fiction works, and have read a ([Finnish-only, non-translated](https://www.gaudeamus.fi/teos/ayn-rand-kapitalismin-valtiatar/)) analysis of Rand\u2019s worldview, so I have some idea of Rand\u2019s general worldview and work.\n\nAtlas Shrugged was, even at my younger and less-distracted-by-life\u2019s-routines (work, child care etc.) years, a real chore to make through, full of uninteresting events and characters that simply were too simplistic and\u2026 unreal to keep my interest. Fountainhead, while having a lot of the same, was quite a bit easier, though there\u2019s still a general feeling that you could easily take 100, maybe 200 pages out without the book suffering much.\n\nLike Atlas Shrugged, Fountainhead makes no bones about how it is primarily a vehicle for Rand to espouse her worldview through her fiction. As one might guess, I heavily disagree with this worldview, and consider Rand somewhere between malign influence on society and a sort of an interesting, real-life thought experiment on what you\u2019d get if you just took Marxism and turned a lot of various things on their head.\n\nNevertheless, one thing that made Fountainhead easier for me is that is much less explicitly a book about capitalism (though Rand\u2019s sentiments on that topic shine though). At its basis, it is about individual greatness and Promethean love of humans leaving their mark on the world. It\u2019s also about architecture and big buildings.\n\nIndeed, this Promethean attitude was quintessential to the 30s; it was very much a part of the New Deal atmosphere, as well as featured in the plans of the various totalitarian projects. These days such a feeling is tapped by disparate sources, from People\u2019s Republic of China to Elon Musk to the [LaRouche movement](https://schillerinstitute.com/our-campaign/build-the-world-land-bridge/). (I know some libertarians are not happy with the fact that libertarians have sometimes been confused with LaRouchies when the latter movement is very statist, but perhaps there are some synchronities after all.)\n\nThe 30s were a peak time for belief that not only is unbridled progress good, it\u2019s characterized by human ability to build huge things and reach for the stars; before that, the capacities to do so were quite limited, afterwards, the environmental movement and general progress malaise put a damper on grandiose visions.\n\nThere are still people, even environmentalists, who love big projects, but there seems to be some requirement to justify how they fit in with the idea of environmental crisis; \u201csure, we\u2019re building skyscrapers, but the idea is that if we fit more people in these cities then we won\u2019t have to cut forests to build suburbs\u201d and so on.\n\nIt\u2019s also evident and underlined many times that Rand\u2019s progress is not just about big buildings but a specific style - the often-derided modernist style, with many very heavy-handed disses of architects designing in classical styles peppering particularly the first half of the book.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that [Donald Trump has praised Fountainhead and compared himself to Roark](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/04/trumps-role-model-is-an-ayn-rand-character.html) \u2013 remember Trump\u2019s bill to make all [new federal construction follow classical architectural rules](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/13/805256707/just-plain-ugly-proposed-executive-order-takes-aim-at-modern-architecture)? Especially after reading the book itself, it seems hilariously like exactly the sort of a bill that would have sent actual Ayn Rand into a frothing rage.\n\nThere\u2019s a rich tradition of anti-modernist criticism in saying that, in particular, Le Corbusier has basically ruined our cities and the entire Western Civilization. However, especially after a bit of googling about what actual architects have said about what is said to be the only book with a heroic architect as a main character, you might as well blame Rand!\n\nApparently Fountainhead had a particularly huge effect on [architectural schools](https://www.archdaily.com/447141/the-fountainhead-everything-that-s-wrong-with-architecture), and their students. This has been not only in the sense of spreading modernism but spreading the image of an architect not just as a glorified artsy engineer but a conquering hero of epic proportions, the sole auteur of buildings who has no need to brook to anyone\u2019s wishes in their design or even execution. I\u2019ve certainly seen architects who defend styles that the public dislikes in precisely such a fashion, including ones with ideologies directly contrary to Rand\u2019s visions otherwise.\n\nSome have said that the book is very much a product of its time, coming at the specific time when the common standard of architecture was that everything worthy in architecture was in imitating historical styles, and modernism only became more popular during the period. Indeed, this even shows in the progress of the book - Rand has to acknowledge that at some point even her baddies would start appreciating modernism to some degree, but of course theirs is a wrong and fake sort of a modernism.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to connect Rand\u2019s visions to her personal development as an immigrant fleeing the Russian Revolution to America. One gets the feeling of the encounter with the New York skyline on the ship to America as a quasi-religious experience. What strange (secular) God can have created such magnificence? The great men she had already been fixated on since her childhood - and capitalism, the American system! And everything flows from there.\n\nThe authorial \u2018perfect man\u2019, example of the author\u2019s ideology at work in this particular instance, is Howard Roark - and since that makes him a cipher, it\u2019s a bit hard to say more about him beyond that. An interesting thing is that there\u2019s development in his character while it goes on. For instance, Roark, at the start of the book, comes across as much more autistic than Roark at its end, though this might also reflect Rand\u2019s writer skills simply developing throughout the book.\n\nEspecially the middle part of the book was a bit of a chore, with Roark in the background, other actually interesting characters like Wynand and Toohey largely out of the game. Instead, there\u2019s marriages and human drama, putting the most annoying characters \u2013 Peter Keating, Dominique Francon \u2013 to the foreground.\n\nPeter Keating is, as said, insufferable, and that\u2019s obviously something that comes from his role in the book as the ultimate personal manifestation of a \u201csecond-hander\u201d who relies on the opinions of the others to guide his life. But thinking about it, perhaps one of the reasons why I found Atlas Shrugged so hard to read in general was how the villains were a bunch of Peter Keatings. Ellsworth Toohey is far more interesting than any of them, because apart from Roark, he\u2019s actually the one character in the book who seems to be downright enjoying himself.\n\nSure, there\u2019s the famous \u201c[But I don\u2019t think of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_E0tfoDSEA)\u201d scene, later perhaps stolen by Mad Men, but apart from thatToohey doesn\u2019t really seem to be ashamed at all about what he does and even enjoys it, including his hammy stock-villain-level bragging about his evil plans. He suffers few adverse consequences \u2013 sure, his plan to take over the Wynand papers fails, but his career continues.\n\nDominique Francon is supposed to be a complex character, but mainly just comes off as weird and flighty, the sort of a figure whose appreciation of human spirit and disgust at the world not managing to meet her expectations, and all the marriages and such are just expressions of that randomness, the true original Manic Pixie Dream Girl (Manic Pixie Dream Author Avatar?) One feels that if Dominique Francon lived now, she wouldn\u2019t be a reporter - she\u2019d have a podcast like Red Scare. Maybe she would be \\*in\\* Red Scare.\n\nWhat I call here the \u2018middle part of the book\u2019 features the famous quarry scene, but even that does not really relate that much to what I perceive as the main themes of the book. I mean, not \\*fully\\* disjointed, both in the sense that Roark having violent sex with Dominique reflects the idea that great men just do whatever they like and in the sense that\u2026 well, we might call it Rand\u2019s \u2018kink\u2019, if I was the sort of people who called everything a kink on social media. Which I\u2019m not.\n\nHowever, of course, without the relationships and the drama, we don\u2019t get Gail Wynand. Wynand steals the scene at the minute he saunters on the pages, with his backstory and such actually representing a moment when Rand manages to do some actual good writing by anyone\u2019s standards. That\u2019s probably because he\u2019s something rare for Rand, an actual two-dimensional character who doesn\u2019t seem like his only function is serving as a meat-puppet for author\u2019s views on humanity but an actual character.\n\nThis reflects a certain discovery; beyond all the philosophical and ethical grandstanding, there are glimmers of real authorial skill in Rand, and it\u2019s easier for me to see her appeal after this book than after AS.\n\nIt\u2019s also easier to see the appeal to, say, various celebrities who have praised Rand. After all, if you don\u2019t take the other stuff into account, it\u2019s really a book about how you should always believe in what you do, ignore the haters and not rely on the opinions of others.\n\nA secular version of \u201cdo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\u201d, with the specific understanding of \u201cwill\u201d referring to some unspecific higher mission - after all, Roark\u2019s greatness is not just in doing what he wants, but in doing specifically what he wants the way Rand wants, not just designing buildings but designing them in Rand\u2019s specific preferred style.\n\nOf course such a creed would be, for instance, appealing to many people in the creative field who feel that they\u2019re under constant pressure of opinion of others - other creatives, critics, agents, public - and that their true talent as themselves doesn\u2019t get out. That sort of thing is also grist for modern girlboss mythmaking.\n\n3/5 , won\u2019t probably read again, may attempt a reread of Atlas Shrugged at some point to see if this gives me some new insight, but then again might not. u/KulakRevolt was interested in this post, at least.\n\n(note: in [blog form](https://alakasa.substack.com/p/book-review-fountainhead), with discussions incorporated)", "author_fullname": "t2_y45w0", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Reading notes on Fountainhead", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wof2pp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 50, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 50, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1660746152.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1660506781.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading the Fountainhead, managing to finish it for the first time.

That sort of thing is also grist for modern girlboss mythmaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3/5 , won\u2019t probably read again, may attempt a reread of Atlas Shrugged at some point to see if this gives me some new insight, but then again might not. &lt;a href=\"/u/KulakRevolt\"&gt;u/KulakRevolt&lt;/a&gt; was interested in this post, at least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(note: in &lt;a href=\"https://alakasa.substack.com/p/book-review-fountainhead\"&gt;blog form&lt;/a&gt;, with discussions incorporated)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "Chief Suomiposter", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "wof2pp", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stefferi", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 92, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wof2pp/reading_notes_on_fountainhead/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wof2pp/reading_notes_on_fountainhead/", "subreddit_subscribers": 18603, "created_utc": 1660506781.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "selftext": "So, assuming Trump is going to run.
