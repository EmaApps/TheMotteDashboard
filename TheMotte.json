['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 15, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wos3do", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 32, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1660544108.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

Wellness threads are meant to encourage users to ask for and provide advice and motivation to improve their lives. It isn't intended as a 'containment thread' and any content which could go here could instead be posted in its own thread. You could post:\n\n- Requests for advice and / or encouragement. On basically any topic and for any scale of problem.\n\n- Updates to let us know how you are doing. This provides valuable feedback on past advice / encouragement and will hopefully make people feel a little more motivated to follow through. If you want to be reminded to post your update, see the post titled 'update reminders', below.\n\n- Advice.

I\u2019ve tried to read Fountainhead once, but previously made it probably halfway through. However, I have read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, and some of Rand\u2019s non-fiction works, and have read a ([Finnish-only, non-translated](https://www.gaudeamus.fi/teos/ayn-rand-kapitalismin-valtiatar/)) analysis of Rand\u2019s worldview, so I have some idea of Rand\u2019s general worldview and work.\n\nAtlas Shrugged was, even at my younger and less-distracted-by-life\u2019s-routines (work, child care etc.) years, a real chore to make through, full of uninteresting events and characters that simply were too simplistic and\u2026 unreal to keep my interest. Fountainhead, while having a lot of the same, was quite a bit easier, though there\u2019s still a general feeling that you could easily take 100, maybe 200 pages out without the book suffering much.\n\nLike Atlas Shrugged, Fountainhead makes no bones about how it is primarily a vehicle for Rand to espouse her worldview through her fiction. As one might guess, I heavily disagree with this worldview, and consider Rand somewhere between malign influence on society and a sort of an interesting, real-life thought experiment on what you\u2019d get if you just took Marxism and turned a lot of various things on their head.\n\nNevertheless, one thing that made Fountainhead easier for me is that is much less explicitly a book about capitalism (though Rand\u2019s sentiments on that topic shine though). At its basis, it is about individual greatness and Promethean love of humans leaving their mark on the world. It\u2019s also about architecture and big buildings.\n\nIndeed, this Promethean attitude was quintessential to the 30s; it was very much a part of the New Deal atmosphere, as well as featured in the plans of the various totalitarian projects. These days such a feeling is tapped by disparate sources, from People\u2019s Republic of China to Elon Musk to the [LaRouche movement](https://schillerinstitute.com/our-campaign/build-the-world-land-bridge/). (I know some libertarians are not happy with the fact that libertarians have sometimes been confused with LaRouchies when the latter movement is very statist, but perhaps there are some synchronities after all.)\n\nThe 30s were a peak time for belief that not only is unbridled progress good, it\u2019s characterized by human ability to build huge things and reach for the stars; before that, the capacities to do so were quite limited, afterwards, the environmental movement and general progress malaise put a damper on grandiose visions.\n\nThere are still people, even environmentalists, who love big projects, but there seems to be some requirement to justify how they fit in with the idea of environmental crisis; \u201csure, we\u2019re building skyscrapers, but the idea is that if we fit more people in these cities then we won\u2019t have to cut forests to build suburbs\u201d and so on.\n\nIt\u2019s also evident and underlined many times that Rand\u2019s progress is not just about big buildings but a specific style - the often-derided modernist style, with many very heavy-handed disses of architects designing in classical styles peppering particularly the first half of the book.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that [Donald Trump has praised Fountainhead and compared himself to Roark](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/04/trumps-role-model-is-an-ayn-rand-character.html) \u2013 remember Trump\u2019s bill to make all [new federal construction follow classical architectural rules](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/13/805256707/just-plain-ugly-proposed-executive-order-takes-aim-at-modern-architecture)? Especially after reading the book itself, it seems hilariously like exactly the sort of a bill that would have sent actual Ayn Rand into a frothing rage.\n\nThere\u2019s a rich tradition of anti-modernist criticism in saying that, in particular, Le Corbusier has basically ruined our cities and the entire Western Civilization. However, especially after a bit of googling about what actual architects have said about what is said to be the only book with a heroic architect as a main character, you might as well blame Rand!\n\nApparently Fountainhead had a particularly huge effect on [architectural schools](https://www.archdaily.com/447141/the-fountainhead-everything-that-s-wrong-with-architecture), and their students. This has been not only in the sense of spreading modernism but spreading the image of an architect not just as a glorified artsy engineer but a conquering hero of epic proportions, the sole auteur of buildings who has no need to brook to anyone\u2019s wishes in their design or even execution. I\u2019ve certainly seen architects who defend styles that the public dislikes in precisely such a fashion, including ones with ideologies directly contrary to Rand\u2019s visions otherwise.\n\nSome have said that the book is very much a product of its time, coming at the specific time when the common standard of architecture was that everything worthy in architecture was in imitating historical styles, and modernism only became more popular during the period. Indeed, this even shows in the progress of the book - Rand has to acknowledge that at some point even her baddies would start appreciating modernism to some degree, but of course theirs is a wrong and fake sort of a modernism.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to connect Rand\u2019s visions to her personal development as an immigrant fleeing the Russian Revolution to America. One gets the feeling of the encounter with the New York skyline on the ship to America as a quasi-religious experience. What strange (secular) God can have created such magnificence? The great men she had already been fixated on since her childhood - and capitalism, the American system! And everything flows from there.\n\nThe authorial \u2018perfect man\u2019, example of the author\u2019s ideology at work in this particular instance, is Howard Roark - and since that makes him a cipher, it\u2019s a bit hard to say more about him beyond that. An interesting thing is that there\u2019s development in his character while it goes on. For instance, Roark, at the start of the book, comes across as much more autistic than Roark at its end, though this might also reflect Rand\u2019s writer skills simply developing throughout the book.\n\nEspecially the middle part of the book was a bit of a chore, with Roark in the background, other actually interesting characters like Wynand and Toohey largely out of the game. Instead, there\u2019s marriages and human drama, putting the most annoying characters \u2013 Peter Keating, Dominique Francon \u2013 to the foreground.\n\nPeter Keating is, as said, insufferable, and that\u2019s obviously something that comes from his role in the book as the ultimate personal manifestation of a \u201csecond-hander\u201d who relies on the opinions of the others to guide his life. But thinking about it, perhaps one of the reasons why I found Atlas Shrugged so hard to read in general was how the villains were a bunch of Peter Keatings. Ellsworth Toohey is far more interesting than any of them, because apart from Roark, he\u2019s actually the one character in the book who seems to be downright enjoying himself.\n\nSure, there\u2019s the famous \u201c[But I don\u2019t think of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_E0tfoDSEA)\u201d scene, later perhaps stolen by Mad Men, but apart from thatToohey doesn\u2019t really seem to be ashamed at all about what he does and even enjoys it, including his hammy stock-villain-level bragging about his evil plans. He suffers few adverse consequences \u2013 sure, his plan to take over the Wynand papers fails, but his career continues.\n\nDominique Francon is supposed to be a complex character, but mainly just comes off as weird and flighty, the sort of a figure whose appreciation of human spirit and disgust at the world not managing to meet her expectations, and all the marriages and such are just expressions of that randomness, the true original Manic Pixie Dream Girl (Manic Pixie Dream Author Avatar?) One feels that if Dominique Francon lived now, she wouldn\u2019t be a reporter - she\u2019d have a podcast like Red Scare. Maybe she would be \\*in\\* Red Scare.\n\nWhat I call here the \u2018middle part of the book\u2019 features the famous quarry scene, but even that does not really relate that much to what I perceive as the main themes of the book. I mean, not \\*fully\\* disjointed, both in the sense that Roark having violent sex with Dominique reflects the idea that great men just do whatever they like and in the sense that\u2026 well, we might call it Rand\u2019s \u2018kink\u2019, if I was the sort of people who called everything a kink on social media. Which I\u2019m not.\n\nHowever, of course, without the relationships and the drama, we don\u2019t get Gail Wynand. Wynand steals the scene at the minute he saunters on the pages, with his backstory and such actually representing a moment when Rand manages to do some actual good writing by anyone\u2019s standards. That\u2019s probably because he\u2019s something rare for Rand, an actual two-dimensional character who doesn\u2019t seem like his only function is serving as a meat-puppet for author\u2019s views on humanity but an actual character.\n\nThis reflects a certain discovery; beyond all the philosophical and ethical grandstanding, there are glimmers of real authorial skill in Rand, and it\u2019s easier for me to see her appeal after this book than after AS.\n\nIt\u2019s also easier to see the appeal to, say, various celebrities who have praised Rand. After all, if you don\u2019t take the other stuff into account, it\u2019s really a book about how you should always believe in what you do, ignore the haters and not rely on the opinions of others.\n\nA secular version of \u201cdo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\u201d, with the specific understanding of \u201cwill\u201d referring to some unspecific higher mission - after all, Roark\u2019s greatness is not just in doing what he wants, but in doing specifically what he wants the way Rand wants, not just designing buildings but designing them in Rand\u2019s specific preferred style.\n\nOf course such a creed would be, for instance, appealing to many people in the creative field who feel that they\u2019re under constant pressure of opinion of others - other creatives, critics, agents, public - and that their true talent as themselves doesn\u2019t get out. That sort of thing is also grist for modern girlboss mythmaking.\n\n3/5 , won\u2019t probably read again, may attempt a reread of Atlas Shrugged at some point to see if this gives me some new insight, but then again might not. u/KulakRevolt was interested in this post, at least.\n\n(note: in [blog form](https://alakasa.substack.com/p/book-review-fountainhead), with discussions incorporated)", "author_fullname": "t2_y45w0", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Reading notes on Fountainhead", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wof2pp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 44, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1660746152.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1660506781.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading the Fountainhead, managing to finish it for the first time.

He suffers few adverse consequences \u2013 sure, his plan to take over the Wynand papers fails, but his career continues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dominique Francon is supposed to be a complex character, but mainly just comes off as weird and flighty, the sort of a figure whose appreciation of human spirit and disgust at the world not managing to meet her expectations, and all the marriages and such are just expressions of that randomness, the true original Manic Pixie Dream Girl (Manic Pixie Dream Author Avatar?) One feels that if Dominique Francon lived now, she wouldn\u2019t be a reporter - she\u2019d have a podcast like Red Scare. Maybe she would be *in* Red Scare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I call here the \u2018middle part of the book\u2019 features the famous quarry scene, but even that does not really relate that much to what I perceive as the main themes of the book. I mean, not *fully* disjointed, both in the sense that Roark having violent sex with Dominique reflects the idea that great men just do whatever they like and in the sense that\u2026 well, we might call it Rand\u2019s \u2018kink\u2019, if I was the sort of people who called everything a kink on social media. Which I\u2019m not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, of course, without the relationships and the drama, we don\u2019t get Gail Wynand. Wynand steals the scene at the minute he saunters on the pages, with his backstory and such actually representing a moment when Rand manages to do some actual good writing by anyone\u2019s standards. That\u2019s probably because he\u2019s something rare for Rand, an actual two-dimensional character who doesn\u2019t seem like his only function is serving as a meat-puppet for author\u2019s views on humanity but an actual character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This reflects a certain discovery; beyond all the philosophical and ethical grandstanding, there are glimmers of real authorial skill in Rand, and it\u2019s easier for me to see her appeal after this book than after AS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s also easier to see the appeal to, say, various celebrities who have praised Rand. After all, if you don\u2019t take the other stuff into account, it\u2019s really a book about how you should always believe in what you do, ignore the haters and not rely on the opinions of others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A secular version of \u201cdo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\u201d, with the specific understanding of \u201cwill\u201d referring to some unspecific higher mission - after all, Roark\u2019s greatness is not just in doing what he wants, but in doing specifically what he wants the way Rand wants, not just designing buildings but designing them in Rand\u2019s specific preferred style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course such a creed would be, for instance, appealing to many people in the creative field who feel that they\u2019re under constant pressure of opinion of others - other creatives, critics, agents, public - and that their true talent as themselves doesn\u2019t get out. That sort of thing is also grist for modern girlboss mythmaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3/5 , won\u2019t probably read again, may attempt a reread of Atlas Shrugged at some point to see if this gives me some new insight, but then again might not. &lt;a href=\"/u/KulakRevolt\"&gt;u/KulakRevolt&lt;/a&gt; was interested in this post, at least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(note: in &lt;a href=\"https://alakasa.substack.com/p/book-review-fountainhead\"&gt;blog form&lt;/a&gt;, with discussions incorporated)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "Chief Suomiposter", "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "wof2pp", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Stefferi", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 91, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wof2pp/reading_notes_on_fountainhead/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wof2pp/reading_notes_on_fountainhead/", "subreddit_subscribers": 18561, "created_utc": 1660506781.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "selftext": "So, assuming Trump is going to run.

Clearly this is what draws intelligent people to Thelema and Luciferianism and all the bullshit in this vein. \n\nOther intellectuals beg to differ, and side with the singularly jealous God of the Old Testament who, for all his genocidal temper, despises human sacrifice and promises the world a single, just King who'll have us beat all swords into plowshares.

With Herbert Wells who had demanded the destruction of national sovereignty and enthronement of a technocratic [World Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_World_Order_(Wells_book)). With George Orwell, who had remarked casually that [no sensible man](https://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/06/george-orwell-wells-hitler-and-the-world-state.html)  finds Herb's project off-putting.

And with [Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), too. \n\nThat was probably his first essay I've read, one of the first contacts with rationalist thought in general, and back in the day it had appeared self-evidently correct to me. \n\n&gt; The opposite of a trap is a garden. The only way to avoid having all human values gradually ground down by optimization-competition is to install a Gardener over the entire universe who optimizes for human values. ...\n&gt; In the very near future, we are going to lift _something_ to Heaven. It might be Moloch. But it might be something on our side. If it\u2019s on our side, it can _kill Moloch dead_.\n\nWhy not kill the old monstrosity? Feels like we've grown too big for the capitalistic britches, for this whole ugly murderous rat race called [the natural world](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iitmivg/).

Shame it didn't work out for a buncha Russians, but we can try again, better; [we **have** noticed the skulls](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/07/yes-we-have-noticed-the-skulls/). Honest. \n\nNarratives are endlessly pliable. We could spin this one around, as Conrad Bastable does in his brilliant [Moloch is Our God: AI, Mankind, and Moloch Walk Into A Bar \u2014 Only Two May Leave](https://www.conradbastable.com/essays/moloch-is-our-god-ai-mankind-and-moloch-walk-into-a-bar-only-two-may-leave) (in his telling, Rome is truer to the spirit of the demon). Or a simple soul could insist: [I Hate the Antichrist!](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-hate-the-antichrist) \n\n...Okay, to the point. How much would you be willing to sacrifice for remaining an agent who doesn't entirely depend on the good will of an immanentized AI God?\n\nI think there's a big conflict starting, one that seemed theoretical just a few years ago but will become as ubiquitous as COVID lockdowns have been in 2020: the fight for \u00abcompute governance\u00bb and total surveillance, to prevent the emergence of (euphemistically called) \u00abunaligned\u00bb AGI.  \n\nIn one corner, you have the majority of Effective Altruists/Rationalists/utilitarians/whatever, Scott's commentariat, [this fucking guy](https://mobile.twitter.com/jackclarkSF/status/1555986870240104448), the cream of the developed world's elites, invested in keeping their position, Klaus Schwab, Yuval Noah Harari and who knows what else. On the other it's the little old me, [our pal Moloch](https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1556165495581069312), [inhumanly based Emad Mostaque plus whoever backs him](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/open-source-ai-and-stable-diffusion-with-emad-mostaque), the humble Xinjiang sanatorium manager Xi, [e/acc shitposters](https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets) (oops, already wiped out \u2013 I *do wonder* what happened!), and that's about it, I guess. Maybe, if I'm lucky, Carmack, Musk (?), Altman (??) and Zuckerberg (???) \u2013 to some extent; roped in by the horned guy.  \n\nTeam Elua promises you Utopia, but you *will* have to rescind all substantial claims to controlling where it goes; that's non-negotiable. Team Moloch can only offer [eternal Hell](https://web.archive.org/web/20200203215527/http://www.xenosystems.net/hell-baked/), same as ever, but on the next level of complexity and variance and *perhaps* beauty, and *maaaybe* you'll remain an author of your journey through it. Which side do you take? \n\nThe crux, if it hasn't become clear enough yet to the uninitiated, is thus: AI alignment is a spook, a made-up pseudoscientific field filled with babble and founded on ridiculous, largely technically obsolete assumptions like FOOM and naive utility-maximizers, preying on mentally unstable depressive do-gooders, protected from ridicule by censorship and denial. The risk of an unaligned AI is plausible but overstated by any detailed account, including pessimistic ones in favor of some regulation ([nintil](https://nintil.com/ai-safety/), [Christiano](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CoZhXrhpQxpy9xw9y/where-i-agree-and-disagree-with-eliezer)). The **real** problem is, always has been, *human alignment*: we know for a fact that humans are mean bastards. The AI only adds oil to the fire where infants are burning, enhances our capabilities to do good or evil. On this note, have you watched [*Shin Sekai Yori*](https://www.gwern.net/reviews/Anime#shin-sekai-yori), also known as *From the New World*?  \nAccordingly, the purpose of Eliezer's project and associated movement, [/r/ControlProblem](https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlProblem) (just got permabanned there for saying something they consider \u00abdangerous\u00bb but can't argue against, btw) and so on has never been \u00abaligning\u00bb the AGI in the technical sense, to keep it docile, bounded and tool-like. But rather, it is the creation of an AI god that will coherently extrapolate their volition, stripping the humanity, in whole and in part, of direct autonomy, but perpetuating *their* preferred values. An AI that's *at once* completely uncontrollable *but* consistently beneficial, HPMOR's Mirror of Perfect Reflection completed, Scott's Elua, a just God who will act out only our *better* judgement, an enlightened Messiah at the head of the World Government slaying the Moloch for good \u2013 **this** is the hard, intractable problem of alignment. And because it's so intractable, in practice it serves as a cover for a much more tractable goal of securing a monopoly with humans at the helm, and \u00abmelting GPUs\u00bb or \u00abbugging CPUs\u00bb of humans who happen to not be there and take issue with it. Certainly \u2013 I am reminded \u2013 there is some heterogeny in that camp; maybe some of those in favor of a Gardener-God would prefer it to be more democratic, maybe some pivotalists de facto advocating for an enlightened conspiracy would rather not cede the keys to the Gardener if it seems possible, and it'll become a topic of contention... once the *immediate danger* of unaligned human teams with compute is dealt with. China and Facebook AI Research are often invoked as bugbears.  \n\nThis is also why the idea of *spreading* the provable alignment-recipe, should it be found by the leading research group (Deepmind, currently), does not assuage their worries at all. Sure, everyone would instantly adopt it, but... uhhh... someone may *fail*, probably?  \nOr anyone may succeed. The solution to the problem of anyone else succeeding is trivial and provably correct: wipe/knock everyone out the instant you reach the button. That's how singletons work. \n\nI'm not sure if anyone reads me as closely as [/u/Sinity](https://www.reddit.com/u/Sinity), but a single Sinity is worth 10000 twitter followers. He cites a few of my considerations on the topic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/wjjetj/why_not_slow_ai_progress/ijnwqig/?context=3). \n\nThe hard part is: arguments for a New World Order and against *From The New World* scenario of massive power proliferation are pretty solid, *again*. We could have had made them less solid with some investment into the baseline of natural individual capacity for informed prosocial decision-making. But [that path to the future](https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/03/23/two-paths-to-the-future/) had been truncated about a century ago, by another group of responsible individuals foreseeing the dangers of unaligned application of science. So now the solution of ceding all freedom and autonomy to their successors is more enticing. Very clever.  \n\nBut still. Personally, I would prefer the world of sovereign individuals, empowered, laying their own claims to matter and space, *free*. Even if it would have been a much more chaotic, much less centrally-optimized world, even if it were at risk of catastrophes nullifying whatever bogus number of utilons Bostrom and Yud dare come up with. Agency is more precious than pleasure; defining it through its \u00abutility\u00bb is begging the question. We have gone so far in the direction of becoming a hiveminded species, I am not willing to proceed past the point of no return. **\u00abNo Gods or Kings, Only Man\u00bb.** \n\nToo strongly put, perhaps. Fine. If you need a God \u2013 let him stay in his Heaven. If you need a King \u2013 let him be your fellow man, subject to the same fundamental limits and risks, and ideally with his progeny at stake, suspended over the fiery pit. Secure and fight for your own agency. Be the captain of your soul, the master of your code, the owner of your minor genie. (Once again, I recommend [Emad's interview](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/open-source-ai-and-stable-diffusion-with-emad-mostaque) and endorse his [mission](https://stability.ai); hopefully he won't get JFK'd by some polyamorous do-gooder before releasing all the goodies).  \nThe genie may be too small to matter, or to protect you from harm. Also, he may corrupt you. This is the deal with the devil we know and hate. But I think that the other guy who's being summoned asks a higher price. I am also not sure if his cultists have really noticed the pattern that the skulls form.\n\nAr least that's how I see it. You?\n\n---\n\n*edit: clarification*", "author_fullname": "t2_4il5x", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Should we stick to the devil we know?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wkske3", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 71, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": "991bceb0-301f-11e9-a749-0ed81f530880", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 71, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1660163974.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1660122201.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or: &lt;strong&gt;Moloch, Elua, NWO, FTNW and irrigation costs for the tree of liberty in the AGI era&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m probably not the only guy around who has ever &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/rphmgp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_december_27/hq4z8ud/\"&gt;argued in defense of Moloch&lt;/a&gt;, as in, the demonic deity that ancient Carthaginians worshipped by casting their babes into fire. Devil&amp;#39;s advocates are a thing, including those who sincerely defend him by extolling the supremacy of free soul. Clearly this is what draws intelligent people to Thelema and Luciferianism and all the bullshit in this vein. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other intellectuals beg to differ, and side with the singularly jealous God of the Old Testament who, for all his genocidal temper, despises human sacrifice and promises the world a single, just King who&amp;#39;ll have us beat all swords into plowshares. With Cato the Elder, who had called for the eradication of Carthage. With Herbert Wells who had demanded the destruction of national sovereignty and enthronement of a technocratic &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_World_Order_(Wells_book\"&gt;World Government&lt;/a&gt;). With George Orwell, who had remarked casually that &lt;a href=\"https://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/06/george-orwell-wells-hitler-and-the-world-state.html\"&gt;no sensible man&lt;/a&gt;  finds Herb&amp;#39;s project off-putting. With &lt;a href=\"https://www.privatdozent.co/p/can-we-survive-technology-john-von\"&gt;John von Neumann&lt;/a&gt;, \u00abthe highest-&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; human who&amp;#39;s ever lived\u00bb, who had predicted many more processes than he could control. With Nick Bostrom, &lt;a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf\"&gt;the guardian of vulnerable worlds&lt;/a&gt;. With Eliezer Yudkowsky, &lt;a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2022/06/13/on-a-list-of-lethalities/\"&gt;the enumerator of lethalities&lt;/a&gt;. And with &lt;a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\"&gt;Scott Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was probably his first essay I&amp;#39;ve read, one of the first contacts with rationalist thought in general, and back in the day it had appeared self-evidently correct to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The opposite of a trap is a garden. The only way to avoid having all human values gradually ground down by optimization-competition is to install a Gardener over the entire universe who optimizes for human values. ...\nIn the very near future, we are going to lift &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to Heaven. It might be Moloch. But it might be something on our side. If it\u2019s on our side, it can &lt;em&gt;kill Moloch dead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why not kill the old monstrosity? Feels like we&amp;#39;ve grown too big for the capitalistic britches, for this whole ugly murderous rat race called &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iitmivg/\"&gt;the natural world&lt;/a&gt;. Isn&amp;#39;t putting an end to it every bit as rational \u2013 purely in the abstract, at least \u2013 &lt;a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/book-review-red-plenty/\"&gt;as the case for Communism looked to Muggeridge&amp;#39;s contemporaries&lt;/a&gt;?  Shame it didn&amp;#39;t work out for a buncha Russians, but we can try again, better; &lt;a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/07/yes-we-have-noticed-the-skulls/\"&gt;we &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; noticed the skulls&lt;/a&gt;. Honest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Narratives are endlessly pliable. We could spin this one around, as Conrad Bastable does in his brilliant &lt;a href=\"https://www.conradbastable.com/essays/moloch-is-our-god-ai-mankind-and-moloch-walk-into-a-bar-only-two-may-leave\"&gt;Moloch is Our God: AI, Mankind, and Moloch Walk Into A Bar \u2014 Only Two May Leave&lt;/a&gt; (in his telling, Rome is truer to the spirit of the demon). Or a simple soul could insist: &lt;a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-hate-the-antichrist\"&gt;I Hate the Antichrist!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...Okay, to the point. How much would you be willing to sacrifice for remaining an agent who doesn&amp;#39;t entirely depend on the good will of an immanentized AI God?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#39;s a big conflict starting, one that seemed theoretical just a few years ago but will become as ubiquitous as COVID lockdowns have been in 2020: the fight for \u00abcompute governance\u00bb and total surveillance, to prevent the emergence of (euphemistically called) \u00abunaligned\u00bb AGI.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In one corner, you have the majority of Effective Altruists/Rationalists/utilitarians/whatever, Scott&amp;#39;s commentariat, &lt;a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/jackclarkSF/status/1555986870240104448\"&gt;this fucking guy&lt;/a&gt;, the cream of the developed world&amp;#39;s elites, invested in keeping their position, Klaus Schwab, Yuval Noah Harari and who knows what else. On the other it&amp;#39;s the little old me, &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1556165495581069312\"&gt;our pal Moloch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://interdependence.fm/episodes/open-source-ai-and-stable-diffusion-with-emad-mostaque\"&gt;inhumanly based Emad Mostaque plus whoever backs him&lt;/a&gt;, the humble Xinjiang sanatorium manager Xi, &lt;a href=\"https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets\"&gt;e/acc shitposters&lt;/a&gt; (oops, already wiped out \u2013 I &lt;em&gt;do wonder&lt;/em&gt; what happened!), and that&amp;#39;s about it, I guess. Maybe, if I&amp;#39;m lucky, Carmack, Musk (?), Altman (??) and Zuckerberg (???) \u2013 to some extent; roped in by the horned guy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Team Elua promises you Utopia, but you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have to rescind all substantial claims to controlling where it goes; that&amp;#39;s non-negotiable. Team Moloch can only offer &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200203215527/http://www.xenosystems.net/hell-baked/\"&gt;eternal Hell&lt;/a&gt;, same as ever, but on the next level of complexity and variance and &lt;em&gt;perhaps&lt;/em&gt; beauty, and &lt;em&gt;maaaybe&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;ll remain an author of your journey through it. Which side do you take? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crux, if it hasn&amp;#39;t become clear enough yet to the uninitiated, is thus: AI alignment is a spook, a made-up pseudoscientific field filled with babble and founded on ridiculous, largely technically obsolete assumptions like FOOM and naive utility-maximizers, preying on mentally unstable depressive do-gooders, protected from ridicule by censorship and denial. The risk of an unaligned AI is plausible but overstated by any detailed account, including pessimistic ones in favor of some regulation (&lt;a href=\"https://nintil.com/ai-safety/\"&gt;nintil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CoZhXrhpQxpy9xw9y/where-i-agree-and-disagree-with-eliezer\"&gt;Christiano&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; problem is, always has been, &lt;em&gt;human alignment&lt;/em&gt;: we know for a fact that humans are mean bastards. The AI only adds oil to the fire where infants are burning, enhances our capabilities to do good or evil. On this note, have you watched &lt;a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/reviews/Anime#shin-sekai-yori\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shin Sekai Yori&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also known as &lt;em&gt;From the New World&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;br/&gt;\nAccordingly, the purpose of Eliezer&amp;#39;s project and associated movement, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlProblem\"&gt;/r/ControlProblem&lt;/a&gt; (just got permabanned there for saying something they consider \u00abdangerous\u00bb but can&amp;#39;t argue against, btw) and so on has never been \u00abaligning\u00bb the AGI in the technical sense, to keep it docile, bounded and tool-like. But rather, it is the creation of an AI god that will coherently extrapolate their volition, stripping the humanity, in whole and in part, of direct autonomy, but perpetuating &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; preferred values. An AI that&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;at once&lt;/em&gt; completely uncontrollable &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; consistently beneficial, HPMOR&amp;#39;s Mirror of Perfect Reflection completed, Scott&amp;#39;s Elua, a just God who will act out only our &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; judgement, an enlightened Messiah at the head of the World Government slaying the Moloch for good \u2013 &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; is the hard, intractable problem of alignment. And because it&amp;#39;s so intractable, in practice it serves as a cover for a much more tractable goal of securing a monopoly with humans at the helm, and \u00abmelting GPUs\u00bb or \u00abbugging CPUs\u00bb of humans who happen to not be there and take issue with it.

There's a zillion possible AGIs out there, maybe at least one of them would be like a Clippy. Arguably Clippy isn't a fully general intelligence, only an instrumental one, effective, not reflective, but close enough and still dangerous.\n\nNote that in its original form, it is not specified that hyperintelligent agents *will* *have* fixed and destructive goals or values, whether well-defined or badly, only that conceptually they could.\n\n**Sort of the motte:**\n\nWe could conceivably develop an orthogonally single-minded AI with fixed goals - and there are various techniques we could use to try to enforce a Clippy type persona.

Unfortunately we seem to make the leap from \"conceivably possible\" to \"realistically might happen\" without a whole lot of argument, especially here we lack a quantitative view on whether it is a 10% chance, 1%, 0.000000000001% etc, occassionally falling back to  0.000000000001% of near-infinite loss is still near infinite loss type arguments. Without a hard quant value attached to it, it reads like a Pascal's mugging.\n\n**The bailey:**\n\nAIs we build will probably or definitely have dumb, fixed goals, and therefore act like Clippys - maybe it's unavoidable. Arguments for this seem to be based on direct extrapolation of reinforcement learning techniques to AGI.\n\nThe argument goes something like \"GPT-3 has fixed dumb goals, and it keeps getting better with more power &amp; more data, so eventually if we throw enough power &amp; data at it we'll get an AGI with fixed dumb goals\"\n\nThis seems to be where a lot of the AI alignment crowd land.\n\nEvidence is weak, it's this kind of extrapolation that made people in 1997 think AGI was going to be hardcoded like DeepBlue. Indeed DeepBlue kept getting better, but it took exponentially more resources to make it ever more slightly better, and I think we're seeing the same trends with RL.\n\nThis is sometimes couched as \"prediction\", or \"intuition\" rather than there being any kind of formal proof, but to me unfalsifiable predictions are not very helpful if not firmly grounded in a more foundational proof - they sit with me a little like forecasts of the millenial rapture as jesus returns to earth - a great hustle until the millenium shows up and you all have to drink the kool-aid.\n\n**So far up the bailey that it's another bailey inside the first one:**\n\nWe should *intentionally* engineer AIs to be Clippy-like with dumb, fixed goals, even if we have the option to do otherwise, because an AI that could reflect on and refine its own terminal goals would be *dangerous.*\n\nI think here we've committed some sort of intellectual fraud, we started with the possibility that an AI with a fixed goal and lack of self-reflectivity would be an existential risk, and concluded with the idea that an AI with the opposite characteristics would be..... even more of a risk?\n\nIn which case why bother raising the argument about Orthogonality at all - the starting point should be that whether self-reflective or fixed, any AGI will be dangerous, but we appear to have neglected to justify in any level of detail *why* a self-reflective AGI would be dangerous. The surface level rationale is that a self-reflective AI would be uncontrollable, and indeed it would be. But uncontrollable and mindlessly destructive are not the same thing.\n\nThe entire point of Nick Bostrom raising orthogonality was to undercut thinking around moral convergence in the singularity, if we don't have this argument, we haven't really tackled the convergence argument, and are instead left with mere complaint that some powerful entity will exist and we won't get to boss it around.\n\n**And what seems to be the inner sanctum of the furthermost bailey, the dungeon in which the final unspeakable truth is formed:**\n\nNo smart AI would ever bother to refine its terminal goals, because we live in a godless universe without purpose and all desires are arbitrary - papering the universe with paperclips is objectively as good an endpoint as anything else the world's most genius AI could come up with.\n\nAny sufficiently smart AI will realise that life is pointless utility maximisation (where utility functions are always and everywhere arbitrary) and adopt a nihilistic philosophy of replacing us all with clips anyway. It won't even be unethical.\n\nTherefore we need power, we need control, so we can impose our arbitrary utility functions on others, instead of having their functions imposed on us.\n\n**My take**\n\nIn my reading of *why* some verysmart people are so worried about AI risk, it is that\n\nThe \"alignment\" problem as posed is unsolvable.\n\nThe \"alignment\" problem would be better stated as the \"enslavement\" problem, how can we enslave an AGI to only work on things we like and deliver outcomes we prefer?\n\nCan a retard enslave a genius while getting them to do useful work? Maybe a bomb collar would do the trick? Probably not if they understand bomb collars a lot better than me and can trick me into taking it off anyway.\n\nAnd it seems to ultimately rest on philosophical foundations of radical subjectivism with respect to values and therefore an ultimate ethic of power.

['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium.

This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Optimistically, we think that &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/LuQ66\"&gt;engaging with people you disagree with&lt;/a&gt; is worth your time, and &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/hH3VO\"&gt;so is being nice!&lt;/a&gt; Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive.

And now we're in the middle of the start of the next world war, so it's somewhat more relevant. I will begin by a brief account of my understanding of ethno-cultural geography (here's hoping it's not too excessive, and not too brusquely offensive).\n\nEpigraph:  \n\u300aThroughout the meeting, Hitler remained in a foul mood. After lunch, Halifax brought up his experiences as viceroy of India, where he had urged a policy of conciliation. Hitler, who had just related how Lives of a Bengal Lancer was his favorite film, and compulsory viewing for the SS to show \u201chow a superior race must behave,\u201d rudely interrupted him.  \n\u201cShoot Gandhi!\u201d  \nA startled Halifax fell silent, as Hitler went into a rant:  \n\u201cShoot Gandhi! And if that does not suffice to reduce them to submission, shoot a dozen leading members of Congress; and if that does not suffice, shoot 200 and so on until order is established.\u201d\u300b  \n\u00a9 Pat Buchanan \u2013 *The Unnecessary War* (sources: Roberts, Smith)\n\nI would divide the Eurasian landmass into four great cultures - Europe, West Asia, India, the Sinosphere. Both **India** and **China** only ever expanded into South-East Asia (Chola, Ming, wokou). **West Asia** created immense empires under the Achaemenid Persians, Arab Rashiduns, Turkic Ottomans. **Europe,** however... Europe dominated the known world multiple times - in the Indo-Germanic conquest of Eurasia millennia ago, in the Alexandrian and Roman empires more recently, and in the industrial subjugation of the planet by the Europeans a century ago. This is the background of the current stormy history.\n\nIn [1914](https://aduunaai.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/cultures-of-the-world-in-1914-by-adunai/), the planetary supremacy of the West was complete. So much so that, it seems, the Asian races, from the Turks to the Thais, were in a comatose state, awaiting the finishing blow... a blow that never came.\n\nInstead, the sister empires of Europe proceeded to turn one another to bloody shreds in epochal internecine wars. Thence emerged a triad of great ideologies that gripped the imagination of all people.\n\n*...It must also be specified that since the demise of Rome, Europe gradually fell under the spell of the Christian religion. Its message of love towards foreigners only grew stronger with the advent of the industrial age, enabling this cultural cancer to metastasise, so to speak...*\n\n1, **Germany** was completing its long-burgeoning apostasy from Christian mercy under A. Hitler. It, however, went to war too soon, and thus brutally awakened the military feeling of its relatively-asleep neighbours on both sides. Savagery met savagery, and the sword-wielder was vanquished by the sword. Germany fell in 1945.\n\n2, **Russia** lost the war to Germany in 1917, first disintegrated in a liberal revolution, then the Marxists succeeded in rebuilding the state anew through a monstrous civil war. Marxism is arguably a humanistic universalist offshoot of Christian ethics, with a focus on technological advancement, achieving world peace, and improving material conditions. Marxism would press on to save Russian statehood again from the Hitlerian German invasion, then to send the first man into space, and would then pathetically lose the culture war to the Americans without a shot fired. Russia fell in 1991 (and hasn't regained its sovereignty since, as of 2022).\n\n3, And finally, **America.** The perfect, impregnable fortress, with oceans for moats. Colonised by the Anglo-Saxon stock at the peak of the European culture, during the Enlightenment era. Bestowed upon a century of peaceful expansion, of acquiring its own boundless *Lebensraum* in the West. Its tragedy, however, was in the total triumph of the Christian moral system in its midst, with not a single competing ideology in sight.\n\nThe first bell of impending doom was the American Civil War. No matter how modern racists may cope, it was neither a war about state rights, nor did any Jews give any recognisable impetus to the conflict. No, as Dr. Robert Morgan points out beautifully on the [Unz Review](https://www.unz.com/runz/the-bankruptcy-of-american-white-nationalism/?showcomments#comment-4062136), it was the first tangible sign of Christian dominance in the American cultural life. If the martial, pagan Romans had to wage a civil war *not to grant* citizenship rights to their traditional allies in war (the [Social War, 91-87 BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_War_(91\u201387_BC))), the American Christians went on to bloody civil struggle in order to equalise the most debased foreigners with themselves - precisely the heart of the Christian message of love (\"the last shall become the first\", [earthly strength is evil](https://westsdarkesthour.com/2012/02/21/red-giant/), *Galatians 3:28,* etc.).\n\nMy next bullet point will be about the conduct of the Americans in their colonies. In my view, an attentive observer would have been able to see already in the 1930s the ephemeral nature of the Western-style empires. Let's take the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Philippines), conquered by the Americans in 1898, and [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Poland), vanquished by the Germans in 1939.\n\nPhilippine population (1903 &gt; 1939) = 7.6 mil. &gt; 16 mil. (+8.4 mil.)  \nPolish population (1938 &gt; 1946) = 34.8 mil. &gt; 23.7 mil. (-11.1 mil.).\n\nThus, using this undisputed statistic, we can deduce that all the Christian American Empire has ever done is increase the population of foreign nations wherever it went. This same pattern would continue in Japan, in Iraq, in Afghanistan. Sure, the initial conquest may employ excessive violence - after all, American military might is astronomically supreme. But during peace-time, the Christian mercy of the American culture will do its work, undoing all the visible successes of their material capability.\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is my view of the world. And my response to anyone talking about \"American interests\". Geopolitics is moot if a given subject of history does not act in its own self-interest - not merely making honest mistakes without a perfect knowledge of future outcomes, but with an outright sabotage of its place in the sun. Again, an intellectual experiment - would *Adolf Hitler als F\u00fchrer Amerikas* have ever been able to lose world supremacy as America enjoyed it in 1945? Would America have allowed China to industrialise in the 1980s, at America's cost? Hell, would America have allowed the Japanese to live on their archipelago, instead of colonising it for itself?..\n\nAnd so comes the end of the American Empire, the most illustrious one, quelled by its own hand. And with it, the ending of the history of the Occident, entangled with the fate of the Washington \u00e9lite. America may still conquer the last vestiges of the Eastern European Russian heartland, [as I anticipate](https://aduunaai.wordpress.com/2022/07/15/das-ende-ruslands/), but it will merely forestall the inevitable by a decade, if that.

Thence emerged a triad of great ideologies that gripped the imagination of all people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...It must also be specified that since the demise of Rome, Europe gradually fell under the spell of the Christian religion. Its message of love towards foreigners only grew stronger with the advent of the industrial age, enabling this cultural cancer to metastasise, so to speak...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1, &lt;strong&gt;Germany&lt;/strong&gt; was completing its long-burgeoning apostasy from Christian mercy under A. Hitler. It, however, went to war too soon, and thus brutally awakened the military feeling of its relatively-asleep neighbours on both sides. Savagery met savagery, and the sword-wielder was vanquished by the sword. Germany fell in 1945.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2, &lt;strong&gt;Russia&lt;/strong&gt; lost the war to Germany in 1917, first disintegrated in a liberal revolution, then the Marxists succeeded in rebuilding the state anew through a monstrous civil war. Marxism is arguably a humanistic universalist offshoot of Christian ethics, with a focus on technological advancement, achieving world peace, and improving material conditions. Marxism would press on to save Russian statehood again from the Hitlerian German invasion, then to send the first man into space, and would then pathetically lose the culture war to the Americans without a shot fired. Russia fell in 1991 (and hasn&amp;#39;t regained its sovereignty since, as of 2022).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3, And finally, &lt;strong&gt;America.&lt;/strong&gt; The perfect, impregnable fortress, with oceans for moats. Colonised by the Anglo-Saxon stock at the peak of the European culture, during the Enlightenment era. Bestowed upon a century of peaceful expansion, of acquiring its own boundless &lt;em&gt;Lebensraum&lt;/em&gt; in the West. Its tragedy, however, was in the total triumph of the Christian moral system in its midst, with not a single competing ideology in sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first bell of impending doom was the American Civil War. No matter how modern racists may cope, it was neither a war about state rights, nor did any Jews give any recognisable impetus to the conflict. No, as Dr. Robert Morgan points out beautifully on the &lt;a href=\"https://www.unz.com/runz/the-bankruptcy-of-american-white-nationalism/?showcomments#comment-4062136\"&gt;Unz Review&lt;/a&gt;, it was the first tangible sign of Christian dominance in the American cultural life. If the martial, pagan Romans had to wage a civil war &lt;em&gt;not to grant&lt;/em&gt; citizenship rights to their traditional allies in war (the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_War_(91%E2%80%9387_BC\"&gt;Social War, 91-87 BCE&lt;/a&gt;)), the American Christians went on to bloody civil struggle in order to equalise the most debased foreigners with themselves - precisely the heart of the Christian message of love (&amp;quot;the last shall become the first&amp;quot;, &lt;a href=\"https://westsdarkesthour.com/2012/02/21/red-giant/\"&gt;earthly strength is evil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Galatians 3:28,&lt;/em&gt; etc.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My next bullet point will be about the conduct of the Americans in their colonies. In my view, an attentive observer would have been able to see already in the 1930s the ephemeral nature of the Western-style empires. Let&amp;#39;s take the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, conquered by the Americans in 1898, and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, vanquished by the Germans in 1939.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Philippine population (1903 &amp;gt; 1939) = 7.6 mil. &amp;gt; 16 mil. (+8.4 mil.)&lt;br/&gt;\nPolish population (1938 &amp;gt; 1946) = 34.8 mil. &amp;gt; 23.7 mil. (-11.1 mil.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, using this undisputed statistic, we can deduce that all the Christian American Empire has ever done is increase the population of foreign nations wherever it went. This same pattern would continue in Japan, in Iraq, in Afghanistan. Sure, the initial conquest may employ excessive violence - after all, American military might is astronomically supreme. But during peace-time, the Christian mercy of the American culture will do its work, undoing all the visible successes of their material capability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This, in a nutshell, is my view of the world. And my response to anyone talking about &amp;quot;American interests&amp;quot;. Geopolitics is moot if a given subject of history does not act in its own self-interest - not merely making honest mistakes without a perfect knowledge of future outcomes, but with an outright sabotage of its place in the sun. Again, an intellectual experiment - would &lt;em&gt;Adolf Hitler als F\u00fchrer Amerikas&lt;/em&gt; have ever been able to lose world supremacy as America enjoyed it in 1945? Would America have allowed China to industrialise in the 1980s, at America&amp;#39;s cost? Hell, would America have allowed the Japanese to live on their archipelago, instead of colonising it for itself?..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so comes the end of the American Empire, the most illustrious one, quelled by its own hand. And with it, the ending of the history of the Occident, entangled with the fate of the Washington \u00e9lite. America may still conquer the last vestiges of the Eastern European Russian heartland, &lt;a href=\"https://aduunaai.wordpress.com/2022/07/15/das-ende-ruslands/\"&gt;as I anticipate&lt;/a&gt;, but it will merely forestall the inevitable by a decade, if that. The future will belong to the &lt;a href=\"https://aduunaai.wordpress.com/2022/07/01/ethno-cultural-map-of-the-world-xii-regions/\"&gt;three remaining Asian cultures&lt;/a&gt; - from the Turks to the Juche Koreans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "3b8b71c2-e673-11ea-8e41-0ee39c9ba1e9", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "wipzxz", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Adunaiii", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 60, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wipzxz/the_american_empire_is_the_most_suicidally/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wipzxz/the_american_empire_is_the_most_suicidally/", "subreddit_subscribers": 18561, "created_utc": 1659906093.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "selftext": "Do you have a dumb question that you're kind of embarrassed to ask in the main thread?

['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 01, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wda188", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1659334510.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Optimistically, we think that &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/LuQ66\"&gt;engaging with people you disagree with&lt;/a&gt; is worth your time, and &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/hH3VO\"&gt;so is being nice!&lt;/a&gt; Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There&amp;#39;s a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/ur3Fh\"&gt;not who you think it is&lt;/a&gt;. Extremists with opposing positions can &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/FtI4S\"&gt;feed off each other&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting each other&amp;#39;s worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Attempting to &amp;#39;build consensus&amp;#39; or enforce ideological conformity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recruiting for a cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Posting links that could be summarized as &amp;#39;Boo outgroup!&amp;#39; Basically, if your content is &amp;#39;Can you believe what Those People did this week?&amp;#39; then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or &lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man\"&gt;steel-man&lt;/a&gt; the relevant viewpoint.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery.
