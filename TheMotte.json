['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of July 25, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_w7h8wa", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658729709.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

I am the bulwark against tyranny. I am a hoot at dinner parties. I am this author\u2019s Tinder bio. I am venerated by the new progressive zeitgeist.\n\nI am the corporeal manifestation of professional burnout.\n\nI am useless. So fucking useless.\n\nThere\u2019s a dull reality to my job, which is that my clients have almost always done the thing they\u2019re accused of doing. And usually the evidence against them is overwhelming \u2014 not even a close call. Yet I am duty-bound to poke, prod, and bluff my way into exaggerating a weakness with the government\u2019s case. This usually doesn\u2019t work.\n\nFor example, one time a client was picked up for his *sixth* drunk-driving incident. He had been prohibited from driving eons ago, but that hadn\u2019t stopped him before. In addition to DUI No. 6, he was charged with fleeing the scene after crashing into another car. The fleeing was ineffectual, if only for the fact that *he literally imprinted his license plate number* onto the other car^(1). I saw the picture of the imprint, with a mirrored alphanumeric sequence perfectly legible on the metal body. Cops found his car billowing thick, black smoke in a parking lot in front of a nearby AutoZone. My client hadn\u2019t gotten far from the scene: He was in the driver\u2019s seat, having already passed out and pissed his pants.\n\nSo yeah, when I meet with clients I shrug a lot and give the \u201cwhat-do-you-want-me-to-do?\u201d look. I try to shift delicately into the gentle social worker persona and talk about damage control, which invariably means telling them that accepting a plea deal is the least bad option. This is one reason why [almost everyone chooses to plead guilty](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/innocence-is-irrelevant/534171/). Ninety-four percent of state cases and 97% of federal cases are resolved by a plea deal, to be exact.\n\nAll this means I inhabit a different role than you may think based on TV shows or the occasional op-ed about the noble role of public defenders. I\u2019m not a special agent who parachutes into the enemy hideout to orchestrate and negotiate an elaborate hostage release; I\u2019m just the widget inspector. I\u2019m there to sit at the assembly line with a checklist on a clipboard and make sure that my client\u2019s rights are not violated too much throughout the process. And we literally used a checklist for DUI cases \u2014 six pages of potential rakes we could only pray a cop stepped on: Yes, yes, you have video of the guy swerving all over the road, his speech is as slurred as mud, and he has a small cargo ship\u2019s worth of empty beer bottles in the back. BUT *was the temperature of the liquid simulator solution utilized as the external standard for the breath sample machine measured by a thermometer which was properly certified by the state at the time*? Hmmm?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t happen often, but occasionally the cops do fuck up. Sometimes they don\u2019t notice the thermometer certification lapsed two days prior, and of course you pounce on that. But this almost never happens, and it also underscores how fungible my own contributions are. Anyone plausibly qualified could replace me and it would not make a difference for the most part.\n\nI\u2019m borderline useless, in other words.\n\nBut there are terrifying exceptions to this rote monotony that forever haunt me. Like the one time I cast a spell in court with eleven magic words.\n\n***\n\nThis happened early, when I was still a baby public defender. My client (different from License Plate Man above) was an illegal immigrant^(2) from Mexico. He was already on probation for one DUI when he was caught driving drunk a second time, seven years after the first. A judge released him from jail provided that his family fork over a small ransom for bail and that he agree to having his whereabouts monitored by an ankle bracelet. He would have to come back to address his probation issues in two weeks.\n\nThe ankle bracelet company sends me an update a few days later. My client had visited their office, informed them that he intended to flee the country because he was scared of jail, then underscored his statement with a flourish by *taking out a knife and cutting off the ankle bracelet* in front of them. In terms of the ratio between effort and impact, this was easily one of the simplest ways he could have irredeemably fucked himself over. But I did not have time to dwell on this. His actions meant I had one less client to worry about, since clearly he had decided to take his chances on the lam rather than in court.\n\nTwo weeks pass and I\u2019m in court. Just a normal day: I review the sign-in sheet to see which defendants, of the cases I had prepped, did me the courtesy of showing up. Our caseloads aren\u2019t always as bad as advertised because many of our clients don\u2019t come to court, for reasons ranging from malicious (they\u2019re reenacting a certain 1993 thriller starring Harrison Ford) to banal (the notice was lost in the mail).\n\nThen I see *his* name \u2014 Bracelet Cutter. I turn and scan the row of benches in the gallery and he\u2019s quietly sitting in the back, apparently oblivious to the shitstorm of his own creation he has walked into.\n\nI motion for him to step out in the hallway and my first question is \u201cWhat the *FUCK* are you doing here?\u201d He looks down, ashamed, and explains he realized that if he had fled, his family would have remained liable for the bond they put up to get him released. \u201cI am here to take responsibility,\u201d he says.\n\nThere was no need for me to pillory him any further. He panicked and fucked up, but that was done. Unfortunately, I was completely ill-prepared to handle his case, as I had reasonably assumed he had successfully peaced out of the country (and out of the justice system\u2019s grasp) by now. We went in front of the judge and I announced that my client was turning himself in to jail so that I could better prepare for his case. We\u2019d be back in court in another two weeks.\n\n***\n\nIn part because of those aforementioned stats on the frequency of guilty pleas, public defenders have garnered a reputation for being trial-averse, for pressuring clients to cop a plea just to keep the machine humming along. I think this reputation is ill-deserved. It\u2019s completely counter to my own experience, at least, as few things are talked about with as much awed respect among one\u2019s public-defender peers as the number of trials you have accumulated. It\u2019s the functional equivalent of an attorney\u2019s XP level.\n\nJury trials are sexy and cool and exciting, even despite the abysmal prospects for acquittal. But the understandable focus on dramatic moments can cause people to lose sight of potentially far more consequential proceedings that lack the luster and allure. Like probation hearings.\n\nI hate probation hearings so much.\n\nThe gravitational center of the criminal justice system is not the judge, but the prosecutor. Prosecutors can summon criminal charges from the aether or dispel them into nothingness, if they so choose. The [Trial Tax](https://www.nacdl.org/Document/TrialPenaltySixthAmendmentRighttoTrialNearExtinct) is real, so if you want to avoid getting resolutely fucked at sentencing, your best bet is to play nice from the start. This is what makes accepting a plea deal so irresistible to so many clients. Judges say they ultimately decide \u2014 sure, whatever \u2014 but in practice, a prosecutor\u2019s offer recommendation is virtually guaranteed to be adopted. Judges are busy, and [the vast majority used to be prosecutors themselves](https://www.cato.org/study/are-disproportionate-number-federal-judges-former-government-advocates). A current prosecutor\u2019s blessing on a deal is generally all the oversight a judge cares to invest. If the deal recommends no jail time, you\u2019ll get no jail time. This is what I told all my clients, and it was always true.\n\nBut there\u2019s a caveat, in that many little- or no-jail deals are paired with a laundry list of legal obligations that are monitored by the courts for many years. In addition to not committing new crimes, the obligations can be as simple as attending a class about how drugs are bad. Courts enforce this scheme by imposing the statutory *maximum* amount of jail time (a year for most misdemeanors), but simultaneously *suspending* nearly all of it. Think of it as setting aside a bucket of jail days that can be doled out as needed if a client didn\u2019t adhere to the agreement.\n\nDoling from the bucket was what the probation calendar was for. Clients who had already pled guilty were summoned back to court because they had fucked up *somehow* and needed to explain themselves to the judge.\n\nDuring these probation hearings, the prosecutor would recite the list of violations and recommend a sanction. My job was to come up with a plausible-sounding justification and make a counteroffer for sanction, and the judge would probably just split it down the middle. Sometimes it\u2019s 30 days of house arrest. Sometimes 90 days of jail. If jail, sometimes clients had a week to turn themselves in. Sometimes the court marshals were summoned to take them to jail immediately. All this in the span of 5-10 minutes per person, one after the other. Assembly line humming.\n\n***\n\nGenerally, we had no way of knowing when someone would be summoned back to court for a probation hearing until it was scheduled. Our paralegals scanned the calendars and dove into our archives to retrieve a client\u2019s file. I tried to call my clients prior to court appearances, but this was often a lost cause as numbers were frequently disconnected, out of service, or linked to full voicemail boxes. The best that you could eventually hope for was for the client to actually show up to court so that you could confer for the requisite five minutes in the adjoining hallways and stairwells before the proceedings.\n\nBut as much as Bracelet Cutter fucked up his prospects in other ways, at least there wasn\u2019t any question as to whether he\u2019d show up for his hearing \u2014 he was in jail, after all. I swung by with an interpreter (his English was passable, but not great) to fill him in on the details and answer his questions. I felt ready for the hearing.\n\nThe day came. Bracelet Cutter\u2019s mother, wife, and children were in attendance in the gallery. The court churned through its list of cases until it was our turn.\n\nRecall how plea deals are structured, and how the entire purpose of a *suspended* jail sentence is to dangle the anvil over someone\u2019s head to \u201cencourage\u201d them to do the things they\u2019re supposed to do. The bargain means you avoid jail time so long as you meet your obligations. But what if, perhaps through your repeated and extended frittering away of your opportunities to stay out of jail, there is no realistic expectation you\u2019ll ever meet your obligations to the court? Rather than continue burning up the court\u2019s resources, judges could instead impose a hefty jail sentence *now* and just close the file. This is affectionately known as \u201cImpose &amp; Close.\u201d\n\nOn this day, luckily, the prosecutor was not feeling particularly bloodthirsty. He was going to recommend the mandatory minimum sanction of 48 hours in jail, which my client had more than already served by now, and leave the rest of the jail time suspended, meaning he wouldn\u2019t have to serve it as long as he behaved himself. I was more than happy to cosign on that recommendation, excited to see the judge rubber-stamp our joint agreement.\n\nDespite the good sign, though, I was still cautious \u2014 I had not walked into the hearing with much confidence. I knew that my client\u2019s decision to cut off an ankle bracelet and threaten to flee to Mexico was going to be on the judge\u2019s mind, and I knew that the worst approach with her would have been to ignore the issue completely. After effusively agreeing with the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, I got ahead of the issue. I started by acknowledging what happened, framing it from the standpoint of a poor guy panicking in a stressful situation, and highlighted the extended meeting I had with him while he was in jail. His family members in the gallery served as helpful props in my argument. After all, *why would he flee the country when* \\*gesturing widely\\* *his family is right here*?\n\nThis did not work. The judge said that she had no confidence that my client would be able to meet his legal obligations. She then turned to the prosecutor and asked what the recommended jail sentence was to close the file out. Which meant Impose &amp; Close was happening.\n\nThis was a full-blown red alert moment, and by far the worst possible outcome. Now that a probation period appeared to be off the table, the prosecutor was no longer tied to asking for just two days in jail. The price to close the file would be 180 days. I stood up and did my best to slide in and emphasize that neither party requested to close out the file, and repeated my spiel.\n\nThe judge politely listened and then imposed 180 days in jail. The reactions came in waves \u2014 my client\u2019s mom yelled out in anguish first because she could understand the judge, and then her son followed after the court interpreter delivered the bad news in Spanish. My client was handcuffed and slumped in his chair, disconsolate. This didn\u2019t just mean six months in jail; ICE kept watch over the local jail rosters, so the sentence was not only long but virtually assured his deportation.\n\nI tried to focus, to ignore the sudden cacophony reverberating around me. I remained standing and stared at nothing in particular. Fifteen seconds passed. *What now?* Was there anything I could do? Was there anything I *should* do?\n\nThirty seconds passed, and the only audible sound was the shuffling of paper and murmurs across the gallery. I figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try, so I strung together a hastily improvised request to the judge \u2014 hereafter known as the Eleven Magic Words:\n\n\u201cIs there anything the court would like to review to reconsider?\u201d\n\nThere are words recognized within legal circles to have near magical properties. The Supreme Court will tell you that all you need to immediately and forcefully end a police interrogation is to [unambiguously ask for a lawyer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/11/02/the-suspect-told-police-give-me-a-lawyer-dog-the-court-says-he-wasnt-asking-for-a-lawyer/). Declarations [etched in steel](https://globalnews.ca/news/926746/dying-sk-farmers-will-goes-down-in-history/) by a dying man have the power to move trillions in assets. Even [the lowly comma](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/us/oxford-comma-maine.html), or the absence thereof, can overturn entire industries. But the eleven words I uttered that day are not valorized or dissected by any scholars. They shoulder no inherent legal significance. And yet, they earned their title for what happened next.\n\nNothing but silence now. The judge peered directly at me over her glasses. She then asked for the file back from the clerk and barely even opened it before announcing, \u201cAll right. Mr. Meskhout, I\u2019ll go ahead and give him an opportunity. *Since you have asked.*\u201d\n\nThe judge then imposed two days in jail. Two days instead of one hundred and eighty.\n\nThe cacophony started up again \u2014 outcries of joy (and some confusion) this time rather than anguish. I gathered that neither my client nor his mom quite understood what the fuck had just happened. I certainly didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201c*Since you have asked.*\u201d\n\nMy heart rate skyrocketed and my eyes twitched. I remained standing and did my best to maintain composure.\n\n\u201c*Since you have asked.*\u201d\n\nI kept replaying that sentence over and over in my head. This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to work. I was not supposed to have this much power. I\u2019m supposed to be useless, remember? A widget inspector. There was something thoroughly unconscionable about what had just transpired. I uttered eleven magic words in the right combination and this man\u2019s life trajectory shifted radically, likely from near-assured deportation to continued freedom in the United States. *I am not supposed to have this much power*.\n\nTo say that I felt fear is an understatement. But I kept all of this to myself. This was my last hearing for the morning and I could go back to my office now and process at my pace.\n\nI hastily scrawled my signature on the court order and walked out of the courtroom. My client was escorted out by the jail guard right behind me. Normally, inmates get their hands and feet shackled together before they step out. My client was completely unshackled. And normally, the jail guards waste no time heading to the security elevator they have exclusive access to, but my client was headed in the opposite direction.\n\nI saw where he was going. His children had been sitting on a bench in the hallway. My client ran forward and bent down to embrace them both, and all I remember him exclaiming was \u201c*\u00a1Ni\u00f1os!*\u201d The jail guard was calmly walking right behind this unfolding security breach beaming and carrying the shackled chain in his hands. My client finished hugging his children then promptly stood up and placed his hands behind his back to be shackled again. The guard and my client continued taking the long way to the security elevator.\n\nI was awestruck by the unexpected display of humanity by the guard. I have no idea when they negotiated this, but he broke all kinds of protocol just to let my client have this brief embrace with his children.\n\nI walked into the main elevators by myself, watched the doors close, and waited for the cab to start moving. Once I knew I was alone and safely insulated by several layers of steel and concrete, I finally let out the primal scream I had been holding in this whole time.\n\nOnce the heart palpitations calmed, I reflected on what transpired. I certainly would *love* to believe it was the Eleven Magic Words that did the trick that day \u2014 that would reflect well on my legal acumen and provide me a modicum of agency within this chaos. But that is a self-serving delusion that would also imbue the criminal justice system with a patina of legitimacy it has no rightful claim on.\n\nIn all likelihood, the judge changed her mind because fuck you \u2014 that\u2019s why. They\u2019re human after all, subject to the same tempestuous emotional storms as the rest of us, including the same impulses that might prompt you to idly fantasize about a horrific vehicular rending of the guy who just cut you off on the road. Despite that human fallibility, they\u2019re nevertheless endowed with a terrific amount of *real* power over other people\u2019s lives. Maybe if they\u2019re addressed as \u201cYour Honor\u201d enough times per minute, they\u2019ll believe it and act accordingly.\n\nOr maybe I should jettison the fake humility and just take credit. Based purely on the sequence of events (I said something, a thing happened), I have a legitimate basis to exploit this story to flatter myself and impress attractive individuals. Yet this too has horrifying implications.\n\nEither way, every day since, I wonder whether I will clock out at the end of the day as the mild-mannered widget inspector I normally am. Every morning I wonder whether that day has Eleven Magic Words and, if it does, whether I\u2019ll be able to figure them out. And every day that potential scares the shit out of me.\n\nAnd yet, I still do the work. I\u2019m still a public defender.\n\n***\n\n^(1) I have told this story to many fellow attorneys, and more than once they\u2019ve had to double-check to make sure I wasn\u2019t talking about their own client, because apparently imprinting your own license plate number on the other car is a relatively common occurrence among the nation\u2019s habitual drunk drivers.\n\n^(2) [Here\u2019s](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/obfuscating-euphemisms-in-the-immigration) why I still use this term.", "author_fullname": "t2_3whc1m0w", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Eleven Magic Words", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_w5jyyd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 172, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 172, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1658595674.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658520321.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Originally published as my&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/eleven-magic-words\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;first contribution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;to Singal-Minded back in February, and now unlocked for everyone.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a public defender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am the vanguard of justice. I am the bulwark against tyranny. I am a hoot at dinner parties. I am this author\u2019s Tinder bio. I am venerated by the new progressive zeitgeist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am the corporeal manifestation of professional burnout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am useless. So fucking useless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a dull reality to my job, which is that my clients have almost always done the thing they\u2019re accused of doing. And usually the evidence against them is overwhelming \u2014 not even a close call. Yet I am duty-bound to poke, prod, and bluff my way into exaggerating a weakness with the government\u2019s case. This usually doesn\u2019t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, one time a client was picked up for his &lt;em&gt;sixth&lt;/em&gt; drunk-driving incident. He had been prohibited from driving eons ago, but that hadn\u2019t stopped him before. In addition to DUI No. 6, he was charged with fleeing the scene after crashing into another car. The fleeing was ineffectual, if only for the fact that &lt;em&gt;he literally imprinted his license plate number&lt;/em&gt; onto the other car&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. I saw the picture of the imprint, with a mirrored alphanumeric sequence perfectly legible on the metal body. Cops found his car billowing thick, black smoke in a parking lot in front of a nearby AutoZone. My client hadn\u2019t gotten far from the scene: He was in the driver\u2019s seat, having already passed out and pissed his pants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, when I meet with clients I shrug a lot and give the \u201cwhat-do-you-want-me-to-do?\u201d look. I try to shift delicately into the gentle social worker persona and talk about damage control, which invariably means telling them that accepting a plea deal is the least bad option. This is one reason why &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/innocence-is-irrelevant/534171/\"&gt;almost everyone chooses to plead guilty&lt;/a&gt;. Ninety-four percent of state cases and 97% of federal cases are resolved by a plea deal, to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All this means I inhabit a different role than you may think based on TV shows or the occasional op-ed about the noble role of public defenders. I\u2019m not a special agent who parachutes into the enemy hideout to orchestrate and negotiate an elaborate hostage release; I\u2019m just the widget inspector. I\u2019m there to sit at the assembly line with a checklist on a clipboard and make sure that my client\u2019s rights are not violated too much throughout the process. And we literally used a checklist for DUI cases \u2014 six pages of potential rakes we could only pray a cop stepped on: Yes, yes, you have video of the guy swerving all over the road, his speech is as slurred as mud, and he has a small cargo ship\u2019s worth of empty beer bottles in the back. BUT &lt;em&gt;was the temperature of the liquid simulator solution utilized as the external standard for the breath sample machine measured by a thermometer which was properly certified by the state at the time&lt;/em&gt;? Hmmm?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t happen often, but occasionally the cops do fuck up. Sometimes they don\u2019t notice the thermometer certification lapsed two days prior, and of course you pounce on that. But this almost never happens, and it also underscores how fungible my own contributions are. Anyone plausibly qualified could replace me and it would not make a difference for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m borderline useless, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are terrifying exceptions to this rote monotony that forever haunt me. Like the one time I cast a spell in court with eleven magic words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happened early, when I was still a baby public defender. My client (different from License Plate Man above) was an illegal immigrant&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from Mexico. He was already on probation for one DUI when he was caught driving drunk a second time, seven years after the first. A judge released him from jail provided that his family fork over a small ransom for bail and that he agree to having his whereabouts monitored by an ankle bracelet. He would have to come back to address his probation issues in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ankle bracelet company sends me an update a few days later. My client had visited their office, informed them that he intended to flee the country because he was scared of jail, then underscored his statement with a flourish by &lt;em&gt;taking out a knife and cutting off the ankle bracelet&lt;/em&gt; in front of them. In terms of the ratio between effort and impact, this was easily one of the simplest ways he could have irredeemably fucked himself over. But I did not have time to dwell on this. His actions meant I had one less client to worry about, since clearly he had decided to take his chances on the lam rather than in court.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two weeks pass and I\u2019m in court. Just a normal day: I review the sign-in sheet to see which defendants, of the cases I had prepped, did me the courtesy of showing up. Our caseloads aren\u2019t always as bad as advertised because many of our clients don\u2019t come to court, for reasons ranging from malicious (they\u2019re reenacting a certain 1993 thriller starring Harrison Ford) to banal (the notice was lost in the mail).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I see &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; name \u2014 Bracelet Cutter. I turn and scan the row of benches in the gallery and he\u2019s quietly sitting in the back, apparently oblivious to the shitstorm of his own creation he has walked into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I motion for him to step out in the hallway and my first question is \u201cWhat the &lt;em&gt;FUCK&lt;/em&gt; are you doing here?\u201d He looks down, ashamed, and explains he realized that if he had fled, his family would have remained liable for the bond they put up to get him released. \u201cI am here to take responsibility,\u201d he says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no need for me to pillory him any further. He panicked and fucked up, but that was done. Unfortunately, I was completely ill-prepared to handle his case, as I had reasonably assumed he had successfully peaced out of the country (and out of the justice system\u2019s grasp) by now. We went in front of the judge and I announced that my client was turning himself in to jail so that I could better prepare for his case. We\u2019d be back in court in another two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In part because of those aforementioned stats on the frequency of guilty pleas, public defenders have garnered a reputation for being trial-averse, for pressuring clients to cop a plea just to keep the machine humming along. I think this reputation is ill-deserved. It\u2019s completely counter to my own experience, at least, as few things are talked about with as much awed respect among one\u2019s public-defender peers as the number of trials you have accumulated. It\u2019s the functional equivalent of an attorney\u2019s XP level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jury trials are sexy and cool and exciting, even despite the abysmal prospects for acquittal. But the understandable focus on dramatic moments can cause people to lose sight of potentially far more consequential proceedings that lack the luster and allure. Like probation hearings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate probation hearings so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gravitational center of the criminal justice system is not the judge, but the prosecutor. Prosecutors can summon criminal charges from the aether or dispel them into nothingness, if they so choose. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.nacdl.org/Document/TrialPenaltySixthAmendmentRighttoTrialNearExtinct\"&gt;Trial Tax&lt;/a&gt; is real, so if you want to avoid getting resolutely fucked at sentencing, your best bet is to play nice from the start. This is what makes accepting a plea deal so irresistible to so many clients. Judges say they ultimately decide \u2014 sure, whatever \u2014 but in practice, a prosecutor\u2019s offer recommendation is virtually guaranteed to be adopted. Judges are busy, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.cato.org/study/are-disproportionate-number-federal-judges-former-government-advocates\"&gt;the vast majority used to be prosecutors themselves&lt;/a&gt;. A current prosecutor\u2019s blessing on a deal is generally all the oversight a judge cares to invest. If the deal recommends no jail time, you\u2019ll get no jail time. This is what I told all my clients, and it was always true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there\u2019s a caveat, in that many little- or no-jail deals are paired with a laundry list of legal obligations that are monitored by the courts for many years. In addition to not committing new crimes, the obligations can be as simple as attending a class about how drugs are bad. Courts enforce this scheme by imposing the statutory &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; amount of jail time (a year for most misdemeanors), but simultaneously &lt;em&gt;suspending&lt;/em&gt; nearly all of it. Think of it as setting aside a bucket of jail days that can be doled out as needed if a client didn\u2019t adhere to the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doling from the bucket was what the probation calendar was for. Clients who had already pled guilty were summoned back to court because they had fucked up &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; and needed to explain themselves to the judge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During these probation hearings, the prosecutor would recite the list of violations and recommend a sanction. My job was to come up with a plausible-sounding justification and make a counteroffer for sanction, and the judge would probably just split it down the middle. Sometimes it\u2019s 30 days of house arrest. Sometimes 90 days of jail. If jail, sometimes clients had a week to turn themselves in. Sometimes the court marshals were summoned to take them to jail immediately. All this in the span of 5-10 minutes per person, one after the other. Assembly line humming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, we had no way of knowing when someone would be summoned back to court for a probation hearing until it was scheduled. Our paralegals scanned the calendars and dove into our archives to retrieve a client\u2019s file. I tried to call my clients prior to court appearances, but this was often a lost cause as numbers were frequently disconnected, out of service, or linked to full voicemail boxes. The best that you could eventually hope for was for the client to actually show up to court so that you could confer for the requisite five minutes in the adjoining hallways and stairwells before the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as much as Bracelet Cutter fucked up his prospects in other ways, at least there wasn\u2019t any question as to whether he\u2019d show up for his hearing \u2014 he was in jail, after all. I swung by with an interpreter (his English was passable, but not great) to fill him in on the details and answer his questions. I felt ready for the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The day came. Bracelet Cutter\u2019s mother, wife, and children were in attendance in the gallery. The court churned through its list of cases until it was our turn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recall how plea deals are structured, and how the entire purpose of a &lt;em&gt;suspended&lt;/em&gt; jail sentence is to dangle the anvil over someone\u2019s head to \u201cencourage\u201d them to do the things they\u2019re supposed to do. The bargain means you avoid jail time so long as you meet your obligations. But what if, perhaps through your repeated and extended frittering away of your opportunities to stay out of jail, there is no realistic expectation you\u2019ll ever meet your obligations to the court? Rather than continue burning up the court\u2019s resources, judges could instead impose a hefty jail sentence &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; and just close the file. This is affectionately known as \u201cImpose &amp;amp; Close.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On this day, luckily, the prosecutor was not feeling particularly bloodthirsty. He was going to recommend the mandatory minimum sanction of 48 hours in jail, which my client had more than already served by now, and leave the rest of the jail time suspended, meaning he wouldn\u2019t have to serve it as long as he behaved himself. I was more than happy to cosign on that recommendation, excited to see the judge rubber-stamp our joint agreement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the good sign, though, I was still cautious \u2014 I had not walked into the hearing with much confidence. I knew that my client\u2019s decision to cut off an ankle bracelet and threaten to flee to Mexico was going to be on the judge\u2019s mind, and I knew that the worst approach with her would have been to ignore the issue completely. After effusively agreeing with the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, I got ahead of the issue. I started by acknowledging what happened, framing it from the standpoint of a poor guy panicking in a stressful situation, and highlighted the extended meeting I had with him while he was in jail. His family members in the gallery served as helpful props in my argument. After all, &lt;em&gt;why would he flee the country when&lt;/em&gt; *gesturing widely* &lt;em&gt;his family is right here&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This did not work. The judge said that she had no confidence that my client would be able to meet his legal obligations. She then turned to the prosecutor and asked what the recommended jail sentence was to close the file out. Which meant Impose &amp;amp; Close was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a full-blown red alert moment, and by far the worst possible outcome. Now that a probation period appeared to be off the table, the prosecutor was no longer tied to asking for just two days in jail. The price to close the file would be 180 days. I stood up and did my best to slide in and emphasize that neither party requested to close out the file, and repeated my spiel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The judge politely listened and then imposed 180 days in jail. The reactions came in waves \u2014 my client\u2019s mom yelled out in anguish first because she could understand the judge, and then her son followed after the court interpreter delivered the bad news in Spanish. My client was handcuffed and slumped in his chair, disconsolate. This didn\u2019t just mean six months in jail; ICE kept watch over the local jail rosters, so the sentence was not only long but virtually assured his deportation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to focus, to ignore the sudden cacophony reverberating around me. I remained standing and stared at nothing in particular. Fifteen seconds passed. &lt;em&gt;What now?&lt;/em&gt; Was there anything I could do? Was there anything I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thirty seconds passed, and the only audible sound was the shuffling of paper and murmurs across the gallery. I figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try, so I strung together a hastily improvised request to the judge \u2014 hereafter known as the Eleven Magic Words:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIs there anything the court would like to review to reconsider?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are words recognized within legal circles to have near magical properties. The Supreme Court will tell you that all you need to immediately and forcefully end a police interrogation is to &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/11/02/the-suspect-told-police-give-me-a-lawyer-dog-the-court-says-he-wasnt-asking-for-a-lawyer/\"&gt;unambiguously ask for a lawyer&lt;/a&gt;. Declarations &lt;a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/926746/dying-sk-farmers-will-goes-down-in-history/\"&gt;etched in steel&lt;/a&gt; by a dying man have the power to move trillions in assets. Even &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/us/oxford-comma-maine.html\"&gt;the lowly comma&lt;/a&gt;, or the absence thereof, can overturn entire industries. But the eleven words I uttered that day are not valorized or dissected by any scholars. They shoulder no inherent legal significance. And yet, they earned their title for what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing but silence now. The judge peered directly at me over her glasses. She then asked for the file back from the clerk and barely even opened it before announcing, \u201cAll right. Mr. Meskhout, I\u2019ll go ahead and give him an opportunity. &lt;em&gt;Since you have asked.&lt;/em&gt;\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The judge then imposed two days in jail. Two days instead of one hundred and eighty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cacophony started up again \u2014 outcries of joy (and some confusion) this time rather than anguish. I gathered that neither my client nor his mom quite understood what the fuck had just happened. I certainly didn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c&lt;em&gt;Since you have asked.&lt;/em&gt;\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart rate skyrocketed and my eyes twitched. I remained standing and did my best to maintain composure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c&lt;em&gt;Since you have asked.&lt;/em&gt;\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept replaying that sentence over and over in my head. This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to work. I was not supposed to have this much power. I\u2019m supposed to be useless, remember? A widget inspector. There was something thoroughly unconscionable about what had just transpired. I uttered eleven magic words in the right combination and this man\u2019s life trajectory shifted radically, likely from near-assured deportation to continued freedom in the United States. &lt;em&gt;I am not supposed to have this much power&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To say that I felt fear is an understatement. But I kept all of this to myself. This was my last hearing for the morning and I could go back to my office now and process at my pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hastily scrawled my signature on the court order and walked out of the courtroom. My client was escorted out by the jail guard right behind me. Normally, inmates get their hands and feet shackled together before they step out. My client was completely unshackled. And normally, the jail guards waste no time heading to the security elevator they have exclusive access to, but my client was headed in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw where he was going. His children had been sitting on a bench in the hallway. My client ran forward and bent down to embrace them both, and all I remember him exclaiming was \u201c&lt;em&gt;\u00a1Ni\u00f1os!&lt;/em&gt;\u201d The jail guard was calmly walking right behind this unfolding security breach beaming and carrying the shackled chain in his hands. My client finished hugging his children then promptly stood up and placed his hands behind his back to be shackled again. The guard and my client continued taking the long way to the security elevator.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was awestruck by the unexpected display of humanity by the guard. I have no idea when they negotiated this, but he broke all kinds of protocol just to let my client have this brief embrace with his children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked into the main elevators by myself, watched the doors close, and waited for the cab to start moving. Once I knew I was alone and safely insulated by several layers of steel and concrete, I finally let out the primal scream I had been holding in this whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the heart palpitations calmed, I reflected on what transpired. I certainly would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to believe it was the Eleven Magic Words that did the trick that day \u2014 that would reflect well on my legal acumen and provide me a modicum of agency within this chaos. But that is a self-serving delusion that would also imbue the criminal justice system with a patina of legitimacy it has no rightful claim on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, the judge changed her mind because fuck you \u2014 that\u2019s why. They\u2019re human after all, subject to the same tempestuous emotional storms as the rest of us, including the same impulses that might prompt you to idly fantasize about a horrific vehicular rending of the guy who just cut you off on the road. Despite that human fallibility, they\u2019re nevertheless endowed with a terrific amount of &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; power over other people\u2019s lives. Maybe if they\u2019re addressed as \u201cYour Honor\u201d enough times per minute, they\u2019ll believe it and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I should jettison the fake humility and just take credit. Based purely on the sequence of events (I said something, a thing happened), I have a legitimate basis to exploit this story to flatter myself and impress attractive individuals. Yet this too has horrifying implications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, every day since, I wonder whether I will clock out at the end of the day as the mild-mannered widget inspector I normally am. Every morning I wonder whether that day has Eleven Magic Words and, if it does, whether I\u2019ll be able to figure them out. And every day that potential scares the shit out of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, I still do the work.

['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium.

This argument casts all challenges to \u201clegitimate\u201d authority as left-wing in nature. A good example is *The Left: From de Sade and Marx to Hitler and Marcus* by Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn.\n\nFrench political theorist Bertrand de Jouvenel describes it as such:\n\n&gt; The history of the democratic doctrine furnishes a striking example of the intellectual system blown about by the social wind. Conceived as the foundation of liberty, modern democracy paves the way for tyranny. Born for the purpose of standing as a bulwark against Power, it ends by providing Power with the finest soil it has ever had in which to spread itself over the social field.\n\nThusly, fascism is not some aberration, but just another possibility of democratic government. Jouvenel goes one step further and argue that not even counter-weights built into the system can prevent this from happening. People who claim to speak for the masses will view them as impediments to achieving their goals. Whether the system then falls to fascism or Marxism is irrelevant, both are departures from some notion of government in which power is limited along class and traditional lines. Tyranny is inevitable in a democracy\u2019s destiny.\n\nKuehnelt-Leddihn offers a similar view, couched in an odd argument. For him, predemocratic Western societies were guided first and foremost by the principle of liberty. Not everyone got it, but power was too distributed for centralized governance. His works have detailed the steps taken by those centralized powers to suppress local power and liberty, both political or religious in nature. For him, the Jacobins were the culmination of two tendencies: \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d and the propensity for destroying social differences, both of which were present in the French Revolution.\n\nThese criticisms (of which there are more detailed in the book, but they aren\u2019t that different) won\u2019t exactly going to find much of a home in modern Western societies, Gottfried concedes. The writers of these arguments have larger grievances with modernity and this fits into their broader goal nicely. But he argues that their arguments typically fail to notice that what counts as \u201cdemocracy\u201d has changed radically over the last 200 years. Today\u2019s democracies are much more likely to emphasize multiculturalism, large welfare states, and loud proclamations of equality and universalism.\n\n####Other Conservative Arguments\n\nClassical conservatives are not the only people to make the case for fascism as a left-wing movement. Historian James Gregor has done quite a bit of work on this as well. What makes his argument different is the focus on the Third World, whose dictatorships Gregor claims are continuing the fascist legacy of Mussolini. He cites in favor of his argument the way in which these dictators invoke calls for national unity to struggle against plutocratic and rich societies. These words, he argues, could easily be fascist rhetoric just as easily as they have been claimed to be communist rhetoric. If anything, fascist concepts are more adaptable, since the resulting society doesn\u2019t make any claims of equality.\n\nGottfried offers some questions in response.\n\n1.\tHow much of this claimed borrowing actually changed the people who borrowed it?\n\n2.\tWhy should we assume these dictators are actually engaging in \u201cradical\u201d/fascist politics and not just taking words and ideas to adorn their nations?\n\n3.\tIn what sense would \u201cradical politics\u201d make a better description of fascist Italy, which retained mostly the same economic structures after the fascists took power, than post-WW2 England, which engaged in radical economic overhaul?\n\nHe casts Gregor\u2019s argument as failing to understand the interwar European right, which valued collectivism and organicism more than individualism, as well as failing to recognize that fascists came to power as a counterrevolutionary force against the revolutionary left.\n\nAnother name comes back, that of Stanley Payne. Payne differentiates between the traditional right (more conservative and moderate than the fascists), the radical right (less willing to support cross-cultural mass mobilization), and the fascists.\n\n####Anti-New Deal Critics\n\nAn important development in America during the 1930s as the fascists were coming to power was the New Deal, a set of programs created by the government to help the country recover from the Great Depression. At the same time, there was notable approval of Italian fascism by American socialists. For example, Cole Porter\u2019s musical \u201cAnything Goes\u201d referred to Mussolini as the \u201ctop,\u201d *The New Republic* had tips for learning from Italy, and people like Horace Kallen and George Soule (both socialist reformers) recommended the fascists idea of autarchy.\n\nCritics of the New Deal thus also criticized fascism. John Flynn decried the way in which the Italian model appeared moderate but wasn\u2019t. In his description, one could support the idea of a planned economy without being considered \u201cradical\u201d if they did so in praise of Italy. Flynn, Hayek, and other libertarians in America placed heavy emphasis on a minimal government during this time, indicating their model of the world was not about right or left, but collectivism vs. individualism. It wasn\u2019t until the 50s that this idea of \u201clibertarian = right\u201d became widespread at the hands of William Buckley Jr. and Russel Kirk.\n\n####Other Conservative Arguments, pt. 2\n\nThe book dives into a lengthy note about in-memory conservative arguments about fascism, and the most notable is that of Jonah Goldberg\u2019s attempt at putting it in the leftist camp with his book *Liberal Fascism*.\n\nGottfried commends, first and foremost, the diligence on display. Goldberg apparently consulted many pieces of literature on what the fascists and Nazis preached and sometimes practiced, then consulted what at-the-time Democrats were saying and traced that to modern leading Democrat politicians. \nThat said, Gottfried notes the somewhat obvious purpose given the \u201cmultiple references to the Clintons.\u201d Goldberg has to engage in some impressive stretching to tie, for example, Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cnew village\u201d to Hilter\u2019s Volksgemeinschaft. There\u2019s a clear difference, given that Hitler would also have been trying to exterminate undesirables.\n\nThen there\u2019s the hilarious fact that Goldberg once condemned Rand Paul for criticizing the Civil Rights Act as right-wing extremism. Gottfried points to the general hypocrisy of Goldberg for claiming to want minimal state intervention but also accepts just about all major violations of that rule as soon as it\u2019s bipartisan.\n\nIn general, Gottfried notes, modern conservative arguments about fascism (typically in detailing their enemies) are very sloppy in use. All things are described as fascist, whether that\u2019s Islam (see: Islamofascism Awareness Week), Putin\u2019s Russia, and more. Some of these people are not terminally interested in describing fascism as a left-wing movement but seeking to justify their own political shifts, but then you have people like William Gairdner who describes the left as microfascists who want to promote reality as malleable. Gottfried concludes with an apt note:\n\n&gt; This verbal looseness makes one suspect that \u201cconservative\u201d journalists are retaliating against those who pummel them with the \u201cf word\u201d\u2026 Such quarreling illustrates what intellectual historian Panajotis Kondylis has styled a \u201cMachtfrage\u201d (question of power), a struggle over the right to define meaning as a way of advancing a partisan cause. This is yet one more example of how the study of fascism has been turned into a political football, a habit that unfortunately is no longer confined to the European anti-fascist Left. By now it may be pandemic.\n\nThis concludes Chapter 4. To summarize Gottfried\u2019s arguments further:\n\n**Classical Conservatives have defined fascism as a left-wing movement based on how it rejected traditional hierarchies in favor of centralizing power in the state\u2019s hands, delineating between collectivist regimes and individualist regimes. Other conservative arguments reflect a sloppiness in using the term by not connecting it to the interwar movements sufficiently, possibly in response to how fascism is a deliberately sloppily-defined weapon used by the left against anything they don\u2019t like.**\n\nNext time, we\u2019ll look at Chapter 5 \u2013 The Failure of Fascist Internationalism.

This argument casts all challenges to \u201clegitimate\u201d authority as left-wing in nature. A good example is &lt;em&gt;The Left: From de Sade and Marx to Hitler and Marcus&lt;/em&gt; by Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;French political theorist Bertrand de Jouvenel describes it as such:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The history of the democratic doctrine furnishes a striking example of the intellectual system blown about by the social wind. Conceived as the foundation of liberty, modern democracy paves the way for tyranny. Born for the purpose of standing as a bulwark against Power, it ends by providing Power with the finest soil it has ever had in which to spread itself over the social field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thusly, fascism is not some aberration, but just another possibility of democratic government. Jouvenel goes one step further and argue that not even counter-weights built into the system can prevent this from happening. People who claim to speak for the masses will view them as impediments to achieving their goals. Whether the system then falls to fascism or Marxism is irrelevant, both are departures from some notion of government in which power is limited along class and traditional lines. Tyranny is inevitable in a democracy\u2019s destiny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kuehnelt-Leddihn offers a similar view, couched in an odd argument. For him, predemocratic Western societies were guided first and foremost by the principle of liberty. Not everyone got it, but power was too distributed for centralized governance. His works have detailed the steps taken by those centralized powers to suppress local power and liberty, both political or religious in nature. For him, the Jacobins were the culmination of two tendencies: \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d and the propensity for destroying social differences, both of which were present in the French Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These criticisms (of which there are more detailed in the book, but they aren\u2019t that different) won\u2019t exactly going to find much of a home in modern Western societies, Gottfried concedes. The writers of these arguments have larger grievances with modernity and this fits into their broader goal nicely. But he argues that their arguments typically fail to notice that what counts as \u201cdemocracy\u201d has changed radically over the last 200 years. Today\u2019s democracies are much more likely to emphasize multiculturalism, large welfare states, and loud proclamations of equality and universalism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Other Conservative Arguments&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Classical conservatives are not the only people to make the case for fascism as a left-wing movement. Historian James Gregor has done quite a bit of work on this as well. What makes his argument different is the focus on the Third World, whose dictatorships Gregor claims are continuing the fascist legacy of Mussolini. He cites in favor of his argument the way in which these dictators invoke calls for national unity to struggle against plutocratic and rich societies. These words, he argues, could easily be fascist rhetoric just as easily as they have been claimed to be communist rhetoric. If anything, fascist concepts are more adaptable, since the resulting society doesn\u2019t make any claims of equality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried offers some questions in response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much of this claimed borrowing actually changed the people who borrowed it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why should we assume these dictators are actually engaging in \u201cradical\u201d/fascist politics and not just taking words and ideas to adorn their nations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what sense would \u201cradical politics\u201d make a better description of fascist Italy, which retained mostly the same economic structures after the fascists took power, than post-WW2 England, which engaged in radical economic overhaul?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He casts Gregor\u2019s argument as failing to understand the interwar European right, which valued collectivism and organicism more than individualism, as well as failing to recognize that fascists came to power as a counterrevolutionary force against the revolutionary left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another name comes back, that of Stanley Payne. Payne differentiates between the traditional right (more conservative and moderate than the fascists), the radical right (less willing to support cross-cultural mass mobilization), and the fascists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Anti-New Deal Critics&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An important development in America during the 1930s as the fascists were coming to power was the New Deal, a set of programs created by the government to help the country recover from the Great Depression. At the same time, there was notable approval of Italian fascism by American socialists. For example, Cole Porter\u2019s musical \u201cAnything Goes\u201d referred to Mussolini as the \u201ctop,\u201d &lt;em&gt;The New Republic&lt;/em&gt; had tips for learning from Italy, and people like Horace Kallen and George Soule (both socialist reformers) recommended the fascists idea of autarchy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Critics of the New Deal thus also criticized fascism. John Flynn decried the way in which the Italian model appeared moderate but wasn\u2019t. In his description, one could support the idea of a planned economy without being considered \u201cradical\u201d if they did so in praise of Italy. Flynn, Hayek, and other libertarians in America placed heavy emphasis on a minimal government during this time, indicating their model of the world was not about right or left, but collectivism vs. individualism. It wasn\u2019t until the 50s that this idea of \u201clibertarian = right\u201d became widespread at the hands of William Buckley Jr. and Russel Kirk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Other Conservative Arguments, pt. 2&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The book dives into a lengthy note about in-memory conservative arguments about fascism, and the most notable is that of Jonah Goldberg\u2019s attempt at putting it in the leftist camp with his book &lt;em&gt;Liberal Fascism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried commends, first and foremost, the diligence on display. Goldberg apparently consulted many pieces of literature on what the fascists and Nazis preached and sometimes practiced, then consulted what at-the-time Democrats were saying and traced that to modern leading Democrat politicians. \nThat said, Gottfried notes the somewhat obvious purpose given the \u201cmultiple references to the Clintons.\u201d Goldberg has to engage in some impressive stretching to tie, for example, Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cnew village\u201d to Hilter\u2019s Volksgemeinschaft. There\u2019s a clear difference, given that Hitler would also have been trying to exterminate undesirables.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there\u2019s the hilarious fact that Goldberg once condemned Rand Paul for criticizing the Civil Rights Act as right-wing extremism. Gottfried points to the general hypocrisy of Goldberg for claiming to want minimal state intervention but also accepts just about all major violations of that rule as soon as it\u2019s bipartisan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, Gottfried notes, modern conservative arguments about fascism (typically in detailing their enemies) are very sloppy in use. All things are described as fascist, whether that\u2019s Islam (see: Islamofascism Awareness Week), Putin\u2019s Russia, and more.

Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of July 11, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_vwbj4s", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 47, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 47, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1657520108.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

There&amp;#39;s a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/ur3Fh\"&gt;not who you think it is&lt;/a&gt;. Extremists with opposing positions can &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/FtI4S\"&gt;feed off each other&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting each other&amp;#39;s worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would like to avoid these negative dynamics.

In any case, the legacy of the Frankfurt School is why Gottfried speaks more directly about them now.\n\nThe story of the Frankfurt School and their relationship with fascism\u2019s changing meaning in the 20th century starts in the 1930s once the Nazis shut down the German institution and forced its mostly Jewish intellectuals to other countries. They eventually settled in New York and began investigating the \u201cpsychic origins of fascism\u201d in the hopes of finding a cure for the madness that infected their fellow Germans.\n\nThe result of their efforts was a seminal work titled *The Authoritarian Society*, published in 1950. This was actually a collection of recycled essays that dealt with anti-Semitism\u2019s social/psychic causes. Theodore Adorno\u2019s famous work *The Authoritarian Personality* (*TAP*) was a part of this, Max Horkheimer (a prominent FS theorist) assigned that part to Adorno.\n\nThe argument was simple; just because Germany had been beaten did not mean the fascist threat was over. No, the real danger was in the victorious Western nations which were slowly moving away from socialism. The American population, in decrying modernist art and being anticommunist, was entranced by \u201cfolk ideas that are even more distant from the life of the people than the most esoteric products of expressionism and surrealism,\u201d Adorno argued at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Herbert Marcuse, another famous FS intellectual, proclaimed in 1947 that the two powers of America and the USSR were both unacceptable to any revolutionary. One was, well, Soviet, and the other in danger of becoming fascist as a byproduct of failing to move from capitalism to socialism. The solution was to resist both.\n\nBut why all this proclaiming about the inevitable fascism in the West? Gottfried describes the motivations of the FS school as follows:\n\n&gt; \u2026some members of the Frankfurt School, most famously Theodor Adorno (1903\u20131969), Herbert Marcuse (1898\u20131979), and Erich Fromm (1900\u20131980), imagined that there could be a future in which sexual fantasies and social needs were both satisfied. This erotically and materially satisfying world could only be achieved, however, by putting an end to advanced capitalism. According to the Frankfurt School, this \u201cirrational\u201d economy perpetuated unfair human inequalities and forced its victims to repress and pervert their natural desires in order to survive in a system of domination over which they had no control.\n\nThe idea of *TAP* was used to explain a lot, in many cases using interviews and surveys to hide the ideological agenda. Some examples:\n\n1.\tBourgeois society made men feel a crisis, which was expressed as anger towards the lower classes, causing social and mental deterioration resulting in patriarchal families.\n\n2.\tWomen who felt hysteria and/or men with antisocial traits were exhibiting \u201cfascist predispositions,\u201d according to Maria Herz Levinson.\n\n3.\tApolitical-seeming students in Germany were actually showing a right-wing mindset, according to Jurgen Habermas.\n\n4.\tAdorno accused a parole officer of being a pseudoconservative on the basis that they didn\u2019t support the New Deal.\n\n5.\tThe California Test was used to place test takers on the F-scale (F meaning fascism). Adorno, one of the creators, claimed it could scientifically determine susceptibility to right-wing authoritarian ideas.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, Gottfried argues, is that American elites did not have these ideas forced upon them. By and large, these theories were adopted with little resistance and had more support than one imagines. \n\nFor example, I think it\u2019s somewhat notable that several members worked with the OSS (the CIA\u2019s predecessor) to work on the aforementioned cure for Germany\u2019s aggressive and fascist political culture. *The Authoritarian Society* was financed and published by the American Jewish Committee. The AJC was no friend of Stalin, being populated by Truman Democrats, according to Gottfried, but they lavished praise upon *TAP*. Historian Christopher Lasch has argued that the people who supported it were too well-educated in research techniques to miss the forced argumentation within.\n\n###The Most Anti-fascist Country And Proud Of It\n\nThe place most impacted by the Frankfurt School\u2019s ideas is, unsurprisingly, Germany. Germany post-WW2 was a divided state that was owned by the Western Allies, meaning it could not really resist the attempts at changing its culture.\n\nThe Western Allies were, naturally, not going to let Nazism rise again. Identifying the Nazis and collaborators was only the first step, the next was to ensure no media ever spread if it was suspected the creators had anti-communist or nationalist sympathies. In Gottfried\u2019s own words, the Nuremberg Trials are \u201cpublic lessons about the evils of the recent German past...staged to advance public reeducation inside and outside of Germany.\u201d\n\nAs time went on, the exiled intellectuals came back to Germany once more. Their base of operations was the university system, in particular sociology departments that the occupation\u2019s government favored in re-education efforts, but also in journalism and the arts. These intellectuals and their disciples were hard at work creating a new consciousness.\n\nThe result? By the 1960s, the critical theorists had anti-fascist followers in the public administration, and even the provincial government of Hessen (ruled by the right-leaning Christian Democrats) allowed these intellectuals to rewrite their primary and secondary school curricula. By the 1970s, the university sociology departments were \u201csaturated with exponents of critical theory\u201d to the point where there was a major tension between orthodox Marxists and Adorno\u2019s disciples. If they agreed on anything, it was in hating \u201cAmerican capitalist imperialism\u201d.\n\nNote: The above is definitive proof that r/stupidpol existed long before the Internet\u2019s creation.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only intra-Marxist difference, of course. Gottfried differentiates between first-generation theorists and second-generation:\n\n&gt; Despite their radicalism, members of the first generation could write knowledgeably and often appreciatively about Goethe, Beethoven, Hegel, and other German luminaries. Their attitude toward the German past was rarely as negative as that of their disciples\u2026Unlike many of their apostles who were preoccupied with proving or asserting collective German culpability, the first generation of critical theorists were mostly willing to let this hobbyhorse drop once they came back to Germany. Their antifascism was more systematically grounded and in some ways less personal than the antifascism of those who came after them.\n\nGottfried describes Habermas as a partisan first and foremost. History, for Habermas, was a tool to reshape Germany, its accuracy is a secondary concern at best. This went as far as lambasting Nolte for placing the Nazis in any broader European context. Habermas also arranged discussion that was \u201cnonhegemonic\u201d in nature, claiming that all would be allowed to speak equally, and the best argument should win. It turned out the exact opposite, with one commentator saying that you could only get into those discussions if you already had the right opinion.\n\n###Neofascism vs. Neo-Marxism, A Sick Idea For A Matrix Fanfic\n\nBy the 1960s, orthodox fascism was dead, and orthodox Marxism had a large competitor in the newer theories of the FS and whatnot. It is the latter group that Gottfried takes time to describe in further detail.\n\nGottfried\u2019s neo-Marxists are entirely without positive traits. He cites Michael Kelpanides, a Greek sociologist, who proclaimed that \u201c[German] neo-Marxists have distinguished themselves mostly by academic snobbery and their resistance to empirical research.\u201d These people defended the East German government even as it was collapsing. These people self-describe as Marxist, but this is code for \u201canti-fascist\u201d, with their stance being moral rather than based on research or some kind of economic world view. They care more about resisting authoritarian social patterns than promoting Marx.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t create academic papers, but Gottfried describes it as a labyrinth for only the initiated to navigate.\n\n&gt; the neo-Marxists expend considerable\u2026grinding out convoluted studies, usually for each other, about the contradictions of capitalism, the immiseration of the working class, and the false consciousness of their opponents. The capitalist foe is often linked to a frozen picture of the market system, one that may have existed when Marx wrote Das Kapital in the 1850s but that now looks outdated. Sometimes the neo-Marxist critics address a global economy, but this complication is described in terms of corporate capitalists who are laboring to hold off an international workers\u2019 revolution. The studies criticized by Kelpanides do not typically draw on a wide data base, and the factual proofs offered come from those who reside in the same academic hothouse.\n\nGottfried goes further than Kelpanides in tracing the origins of this ideology. The latter tracks it to the 1960s, but the former says this is the effect of post-WW2 reeducation efforts. Well-funded sociology departments, as mentioned earlier, were part of a serious Allied effort to prevent Nazism, and this outcome was recommended by advisors to the Allies. Unique, then, to the German neo-Marxists, is a strong focus on fighting authoritarianism or some omni-present fascist threat. Other movements don\u2019t lack these ideas, rather the focus is elsewhere.\n\nAntinationalism was a prominent feature as well, and this was based on a broader desire to condemn the entirety of German history. That history, the argument went, culminated in fascism and neofascism, so it had to be discredited entirely if the threats were to be defeated. In more modern times, this has become, Gottfried explains, a rejection of any idea of Western or European identity politics.\n\nNone of this is to say that extreme nationalist parties didn\u2019t exist in Europe. Gottfried points to the Hungarian Jobbik party which scolded Jews for their disproportionate membership in the Communist Party, as well as the Greater Romania Party which \u201cdoes not shun comparisons with the Iron Guard.\u201d But, he argues, these parties are much tamer and of much smaller power than the Nazis or fascists ever were. Other parties in Europe, like the German NDP or French National Front, are much further from the Nazis or fascists than the Hungarians or Romanians.\n\n###Totalitarianism? What\u2019s That?\n\nThe effect of all this ideological work by the leftists in question, Gottfried argues, has led to the struggle changing from fighting totalitarianism to fighting right-wing extremism. The reasons are three-fold.\n\nFirst, the large communist movements in France and Italy were absorbed into left-wing democratic parties, and their demonologies were adopted as well.\n\nSecondly, what he calls an \u201cinevitable identification [of totalitarianism] with American power during the Cold War.\u201d Anti-Americanism has a long history in Europe, appealing to the traditional right long before it was a staple for the far left. For example, Carl Schmitt spoke strongly about the imperialist nature of America\u2019s desire to spread democracy throughout the world. The effect was to create skepticism around the concept of totalitarianism, which was seen as justifying America\u2019s military presence in Europe. \n\nThirdly, German intellectuals like Habermas didn\u2019t want anything to interfere with the goal of isolating German history as a unique fountain of evil and repression. In 1967, for instance, a work by German psychologists Alexander and Margarete Mitscherlich declared a collective German mental disorder (a running theme with the Frankfurt School was apparently declaring opposition to their ideas as equivalent to a mental disorder). They were determined to see Germans confront their wrongdoing and atone for a uniquely German sin, to the point that Alexander would apparently get very angry if anyone mentioned that millions of ethnic Germans were forced to leave eastern Europe.\n\nOne smaller reason also has to do with the post-1960s declaration that Nazi anti-Semitism had its roots in Christianity, going so far as to claim that Christianity was responsible for the Holocaust.\nIn any case, the effect this has all had in the modern day is obvious, with accusations flying that those who oppose immigration from the Third World or those who ask about the race-IQ connection or those who complain about crime are all fascist. The term is stretched wider and wider until it might as well be a hot-air balloon in size.\n\nTo summarize Gottfried\u2019s arguments further:\n\n**The Frankfurt School has had profound influence over how people see fascism and its connections to various ideas and histories. The intellectuals in the Frankfurt School were politically motivated to pathologize fascism and anything else they thought stood in the way of their liberated utopia. This effect is most pronounced in Germany, which was radically reshaped by Allied efforts to prevent any German Nazi movement from ever reoccurring and the subsequent conquering of universities, journalism, and the arts by the Frankfurt School to turn them into vessels for pushing the agenda of Adorno and his peers. The neo-Marxists are not interested in intellectually honest research or academic work, they act primarily from a moral stance that has little to do with Marx and more to do with fighting anything seen as right-wing or authoritarianism. In more modern times, this has resulted in a reorientation from fighting totalitarianism to fighting perceived right-wing extremism.**\n\nNext time, we\u2019ll go over Chapter 4 \u2013 Fascism as a Movement of the Left.\n\nI hope you enjoyed!", "author_fullname": "t2_crpze", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Let\u2019s Interview Fascism with Paul Gottfried, pt. 3 \u2013 Fascism as the Unconquered Past", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theschism", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_vrc0pq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1656954102.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.theschism", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/theschism/comments/vlalpk/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt1/\"&gt;Part 1 \u2013 Defining Fascism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/theschism/comments/vnn0yx/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_2/\"&gt;Part 2 \u2013 Fascism and Totalitarianism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Can\u2019t Avoid The Frankfurt Folk&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the boys of the Institute for Social Research get a lengthy section of this book dedicated to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those who don\u2019t know, the Institute of Social Research is the home of the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School\"&gt;Frankfurt School&lt;/a&gt; (FS), the collection of works and authors who pioneered the idea of Critical Theory and are integral to any discussion of Cultural Marxism, whether you believe it\u2019s all a right-wing conspiracy or you think these people are proof Joseph McCarthy should have started with academics at the top of his lists. In any case, the legacy of the Frankfurt School is why Gottfried speaks more directly about them now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The story of the Frankfurt School and their relationship with fascism\u2019s changing meaning in the 20th century starts in the 1930s once the Nazis shut down the German institution and forced its mostly Jewish intellectuals to other countries. They eventually settled in New York and began investigating the \u201cpsychic origins of fascism\u201d in the hopes of finding a cure for the madness that infected their fellow Germans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result of their efforts was a seminal work titled &lt;em&gt;The Authoritarian Society&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1950. This was actually a collection of recycled essays that dealt with anti-Semitism\u2019s social/psychic causes. Theodore Adorno\u2019s famous work &lt;em&gt;The Authoritarian Personality&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;TAP&lt;/em&gt;) was a part of this, Max Horkheimer (a prominent FS theorist) assigned that part to Adorno.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The argument was simple; just because Germany had been beaten did not mean the fascist threat was over. No, the real danger was in the victorious Western nations which were slowly moving away from socialism. The American population, in decrying modernist art and being anticommunist, was entranced by \u201cfolk ideas that are even more distant from the life of the people than the most esoteric products of expressionism and surrealism,\u201d Adorno argued at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Herbert Marcuse, another famous FS intellectual, proclaimed in 1947 that the two powers of America and the USSR were both unacceptable to any revolutionary. One was, well, Soviet, and the other in danger of becoming fascist as a byproduct of failing to move from capitalism to socialism. The solution was to resist both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why all this proclaiming about the inevitable fascism in the West? Gottfried describes the motivations of the FS school as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u2026some members of the Frankfurt School, most famously Theodor Adorno (1903\u20131969), Herbert Marcuse (1898\u20131979), and Erich Fromm (1900\u20131980), imagined that there could be a future in which sexual fantasies and social needs were both satisfied. This erotically and materially satisfying world could only be achieved, however, by putting an end to advanced capitalism. According to the Frankfurt School, this \u201cirrational\u201d economy perpetuated unfair human inequalities and forced its victims to repress and pervert their natural desires in order to survive in a system of domination over which they had no control.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of &lt;em&gt;TAP&lt;/em&gt; was used to explain a lot, in many cases using interviews and surveys to hide the ideological agenda. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bourgeois society made men feel a crisis, which was expressed as anger towards the lower classes, causing social and mental deterioration resulting in patriarchal families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who felt hysteria and/or men with antisocial traits were exhibiting \u201cfascist predispositions,\u201d according to Maria Herz Levinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apolitical-seeming students in Germany were actually showing a right-wing mindset, according to Jurgen Habermas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adorno accused a parole officer of being a pseudoconservative on the basis that they didn\u2019t support the New Deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Test was used to place test takers on the F-scale (F meaning fascism). Adorno, one of the creators, claimed it could scientifically determine susceptibility to right-wing authoritarian ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s worse, Gottfried argues, is that American elites did not have these ideas forced upon them. By and large, these theories were adopted with little resistance and had more support than one imagines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, I think it\u2019s somewhat notable that several members worked with the OSS (the CIA\u2019s predecessor) to work on the aforementioned cure for Germany\u2019s aggressive and fascist political culture. &lt;em&gt;The Authoritarian Society&lt;/em&gt; was financed and published by the American Jewish Committee. The AJC was no friend of Stalin, being populated by Truman Democrats, according to Gottfried, but they lavished praise upon &lt;em&gt;TAP&lt;/em&gt;. Historian Christopher Lasch has argued that the people who supported it were too well-educated in research techniques to miss the forced argumentation within.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Most Anti-fascist Country And Proud Of It&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The place most impacted by the Frankfurt School\u2019s ideas is, unsurprisingly, Germany. Germany post-WW2 was a divided state that was owned by the Western Allies, meaning it could not really resist the attempts at changing its culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Western Allies were, naturally, not going to let Nazism rise again. Identifying the Nazis and collaborators was only the first step, the next was to ensure no media ever spread if it was suspected the creators had anti-communist or nationalist sympathies. In Gottfried\u2019s own words, the Nuremberg Trials are \u201cpublic lessons about the evils of the recent German past...staged to advance public reeducation inside and outside of Germany.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As time went on, the exiled intellectuals came back to Germany once more. Their base of operations was the university system, in particular sociology departments that the occupation\u2019s government favored in re-education efforts, but also in journalism and the arts. These intellectuals and their disciples were hard at work creating a new consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result? By the 1960s, the critical theorists had anti-fascist followers in the public administration, and even the provincial government of Hessen (ruled by the right-leaning Christian Democrats) allowed these intellectuals to rewrite their primary and secondary school curricula. By the 1970s, the university sociology departments were \u201csaturated with exponents of critical theory\u201d to the point where there was a major tension between orthodox Marxists and Adorno\u2019s disciples. If they agreed on anything, it was in hating \u201cAmerican capitalist imperialism\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: The above is definitive proof that &lt;a href=\"/r/stupidpol\"&gt;r/stupidpol&lt;/a&gt; existed long before the Internet\u2019s creation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn\u2019t the only intra-Marxist difference, of course. Gottfried differentiates between first-generation theorists and second-generation:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite their radicalism, members of the first generation could write knowledgeably and often appreciatively about Goethe, Beethoven, Hegel, and other German luminaries. Their attitude toward the German past was rarely as negative as that of their disciples\u2026Unlike many of their apostles who were preoccupied with proving or asserting collective German culpability, the first generation of critical theorists were mostly willing to let this hobbyhorse drop once they came back to Germany. Their antifascism was more systematically grounded and in some ways less personal than the antifascism of those who came after them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried describes Habermas as a partisan first and foremost. History, for Habermas, was a tool to reshape Germany, its accuracy is a secondary concern at best. This went as far as lambasting Nolte for placing the Nazis in any broader European context. Habermas also arranged discussion that was \u201cnonhegemonic\u201d in nature, claiming that all would be allowed to speak equally, and the best argument should win. It turned out the exact opposite, with one commentator saying that you could only get into those discussions if you already had the right opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Neofascism vs. Neo-Marxism, A Sick Idea For A Matrix Fanfic&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the 1960s, orthodox fascism was dead, and orthodox Marxism had a large competitor in the newer theories of the FS and whatnot. It is the latter group that Gottfried takes time to describe in further detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried\u2019s neo-Marxists are entirely without positive traits. He cites Michael Kelpanides, a Greek sociologist, who proclaimed that \u201c[German] neo-Marxists have distinguished themselves mostly by academic snobbery and their resistance to empirical research.\u201d These people defended the East German government even as it was collapsing. These people self-describe as Marxist, but this is code for \u201canti-fascist\u201d, with their stance being moral rather than based on research or some kind of economic world view. They care more about resisting authoritarian social patterns than promoting Marx.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t create academic papers, but Gottfried describes it as a labyrinth for only the initiated to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the neo-Marxists expend considerable\u2026grinding out convoluted studies, usually for each other, about the contradictions of capitalism, the immiseration of the working class, and the false consciousness of their opponents. The capitalist foe is often linked to a frozen picture of the market system, one that may have existed when Marx wrote Das Kapital in the 1850s but that now looks outdated. Sometimes the neo-Marxist critics address a global economy, but this complication is described in terms of corporate capitalists who are laboring to hold off an international workers\u2019 revolution. The studies criticized by Kelpanides do not typically draw on a wide data base, and the factual proofs offered come from those who reside in the same academic hothouse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gottfried goes further than Kelpanides in tracing the origins of this ideology. The latter tracks it to the 1960s, but the former says this is the effect of post-WW2 reeducation efforts. Well-funded sociology departments, as mentioned earlier, were part of a serious Allied effort to prevent Nazism, and this outcome was recommended by advisors to the Allies. Unique, then, to the German neo-Marxists, is a strong focus on fighting authoritarianism or some omni-present fascist threat. Other movements don\u2019t lack these ideas, rather the focus is elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Antinationalism was a prominent feature as well, and this was based on a broader desire to condemn the entirety of German history. That history, the argument went, culminated in fascism and neofascism, so it had to be discredited entirely if the threats were to be defeated. In more modern times, this has become, Gottfried explains, a rejection of any idea of Western or European identity politics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that extreme nationalist parties didn\u2019t exist in Europe. Gottfried points to the Hungarian Jobbik party which scolded Jews for their disproportionate membership in the Communist Party, as well as the Greater Romania Party which \u201cdoes not shun comparisons with the Iron Guard.\u201d But, he argues, these parties are much tamer and of much smaller power than the Nazis or fascists ever were. Other parties in Europe, like the German NDP or French National Front, are much further from the Nazis or fascists than the Hungarians or Romanians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Totalitarianism? What\u2019s That?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The effect of all this ideological work by the leftists in question, Gottfried argues, has led to the struggle changing from fighting totalitarianism to fighting right-wing extremism. The reasons are three-fold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, the large communist movements in France and Italy were absorbed into left-wing democratic parties, and their demonologies were adopted as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, what he calls an \u201cinevitable identification [of totalitarianism] with American power during the Cold War.\u201d Anti-Americanism has a long history in Europe, appealing to the traditional right long before it was a staple for the far left. For example, Carl Schmitt spoke strongly about the imperialist nature of America\u2019s desire to spread democracy throughout the world. The effect was to create skepticism around the concept of totalitarianism, which was seen as justifying America\u2019s military presence in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, German intellectuals like Habermas didn\u2019t want anything to interfere with the goal of isolating German history as a unique fountain of evil and repression. In 1967, for instance, a work by German psychologists Alexander and Margarete Mitscherlich declared a collective German mental disorder (a running theme with the Frankfurt School was apparently declaring opposition to their ideas as equivalent to a mental disorder). They were determined to see Germans confront their wrongdoing and atone for a uniquely German sin, to the point that Alexander would apparently get very angry if anyone mentioned that millions of ethnic Germans were forced to leave eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One smaller reason also has to do with the post-1960s declaration that Nazi anti-Semitism had its roots in Christianity, going so far as to claim that Christianity was responsible for the Holocaust.\nIn any case, the effect this has all had in the modern day is obvious, with accusations flying that those who oppose immigration from the Third World or those who ask about the race-IQ connection or those who complain about crime are all fascist. The term is stretched wider and wider until it might as well be a hot-air balloon in size.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To summarize Gottfried\u2019s arguments further:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Frankfurt School has had profound influence over how people see fascism and its connections to various ideas and histories. The intellectuals in the Frankfurt School were politically motivated to pathologize fascism and anything else they thought stood in the way of their liberated utopia. This effect is most pronounced in Germany, which was radically reshaped by Allied efforts to prevent any German Nazi movement from ever reoccurring and the subsequent conquering of universities, journalism, and the arts by the Frankfurt School to turn them into vessels for pushing the agenda of Adorno and his peers. The neo-Marxists are not interested in intellectually honest research or academic work, they act primarily from a moral stance that has little to do with Marx and more to do with fighting anything seen as right-wing or authoritarianism. In more modern times, this has resulted in a reorientation from fighting totalitarianism to fighting perceived right-wing extremism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time, we\u2019ll go over Chapter 4 \u2013 Fascism as a Movement of the Left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_3e75p", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "vrc0pq", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DrManhattan16", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/theschism/comments/vrc0pq/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_3/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/theschism/comments/vrc0pq/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_3/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2507, "created_utc": 1656954102.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}], "created": 1656954131.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.theschism", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/theschism/comments/vrc0pq/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_3/", "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "vrc134", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DrManhattan16", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "crosspost_parent": "t3_vrc0pq", "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/vrc134/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_3/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "/r/theschism/comments/vrc0pq/lets_interview_fascism_with_paul_gottfried_pt_3/", "subreddit_subscribers": 18413, "created_utc": 1656954131.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "selftext": "This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts.

There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!'

When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can.

Extremists with opposing positions can &lt;a href=\"http://archive.is/FtI4S\"&gt;feed off each other&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting each other&amp;#39;s worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Attempting to &amp;#39;build consensus&amp;#39; or enforce ideological conformity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recruiting for a cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Posting links that could be summarized as &amp;#39;Boo outgroup!&amp;#39; Basically, if your content is &amp;#39;Can you believe what Those People did this week?&amp;#39; then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or &lt;a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man\"&gt;steel-man&lt;/a&gt; the relevant viewpoint.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don&amp;#39;t paraphrase unflatteringly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at &lt;a href=\"/r/TheThread\"&gt;r/TheThread&lt;/a&gt;. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on &amp;#39;report&amp;#39; at the bottom of the post, selecting &amp;#39;this breaks &lt;a href=\"/r/themotte\"&gt;r/themotte&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s rules, or is of interest to the mods&amp;#39; from the pop-up menu and then selecting &amp;#39;Actually a quality contribution&amp;#39; from the sub-menu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locking Your Own Posts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We&amp;#39;ve got a solution for you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they&amp;#39;re long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For each post &lt;em&gt;except the last one&lt;/em&gt;, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase &lt;code&gt;automod_multipart_lockme&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can then edit it to remove that phrase and it&amp;#39;ll stay locked. This means that &lt;em&gt;you cannot unlock your post on your own&lt;/em&gt;, so make sure you do this &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;ve posted your entire series. Also, don&amp;#39;t lock the last one or people can&amp;#39;t respond to you. &lt;em&gt;Also&lt;/em&gt;, this gets reported to the mods, so don&amp;#39;t abuse it or we&amp;#39;ll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\"&gt;https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://redditsearch.io/\"&gt;RedditSearch.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://camas.unddit.com/\"&gt;Camas Reddit Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Append &lt;code&gt;?sort=old&amp;amp;depth=1&lt;/code&gt; to the end of this page&amp;#39;s URL&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": "moderator", "subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "vr0t4v", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2864, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/", "subreddit_subscribers": 18413, "created_utc": 1656915310.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "selftext": "Do you have a dumb question that you're kind of embarrassed to ask in the main thread?
