It&#39;s something that occurred to me during a long evening walk and I can&#39;t decide whether this is a somewhat accurate map of the territory or a complete fabrication of some baser part of my mind.

Collectivism as a different mode of being. I had always assumed that people who lean toward it do so through a conscious choice, that they think through some sort of mini social contract, judge the benefits, and accept/reject it on merit before joining a group. Also, they&#39;re conscious and watchful while part of some group so that if the group breaks the contract, they would leave it.

But what if it&#39;s not a conscious choice? What if, whoever dips their head under the collectivist waterline, surrenders their &#34;self&#34; and their brain becomes a substrate for running the collective&#39;s distributed OS?

Perhaps it will help if I describe what lead me to this train of thought. I imagined a person deeply enmeshed in some collective identity. If you&#39;re in the US, imagine a woman with short blue hair, her face full of piercings, a t-shirt that says &#34;long live Che&#34;, a pair of Doc Marten&#39;s, and NPR blaring on her headphones. Or, to balance things out, imagine an obese man driving a leased pickup truck with one American and one Gadsden flag, listening to a radio version of One America Network&#39;s report about election fraud.

What these two stereotype images have in common is that it seems both of these people have surrendered their minds to a collective. In other words, they outsource their opinion-formation and worldview out to a group of people. Do they still reason? Are they critical of new information? Do they introspect? Or do they merely think what their chosen collective tells them to think?

I&#39;ve met many people that fall somewhere farther or closer to these stereotypes. And one characteristic that always strikes me is that they communicate in the same way: repeating slogans or headlines from their preferred media source (or social media milieu), ie. they&#39;re outputting canned rhetoric someone cooked up for them. Because of that, they can&#39;t actually engage in a discussion because they can&#39;t respond to arguments. They can only shoot back these prepackaged messages.

Going down this slippery slope, talking with people like this doesn&#39;t mean engaging with a reasoning individual, but with a tentacle of a much larger organism. Basically, an alien.

Eh, I know that to some this must sound like an edgy 16 yo&#39;s, &#34;2deep4you&#34; line of thinking. I think I bring it up because it&#39;s dawning on me just how differently different people think and it&#39;s freaking me out. I think one of my core beliefs was that people reason more or less in the same way, but observing people is shaking things up in my mind.

So, is there any merit to this? Any threads in the form of reading I could pull to understand this side of humanity better? Any gross mistakes in this view?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifqfwcp/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifp0lwd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">According to [this graph ](https://nitter.net/QuarantinedCoof/status/15461851456</title><updated>2022-07-11T07:01:36Z</updated><author><name>RadicalizeMeCaptain</name></author><content type="text">According to [this graph ](https://nitter.net/QuarantinedCoof/status/1546185145698353154#m), Biden&#39;s approval rating took a big dip after the Afghanistan pullout.

The (imo) stupid adage that science advances one funeral at a time is so old that I think it has finally [overstayed its welcome](https://rootsofprogress.org/how-curing-aging-could-help-progress) and, with any luck, we&#39;ll bid it final goodbyes soon enough. 

Yes sometimes, often even, it is right on the money. There are walking scholarly zombies all around: people who&#39;ve bet it all on a hypothesis, have been publicly and convincingly proven wrong (or had the ground move under them to the point their entire map became obsolete) and have not recanted. Indeed, some double down or just begin to ignore all criticism. 

What do we know about such cases and such people? Are they just cognitively rigid and emotionally invested? Bound like slaves to a cottage factory that has been built around their assumptions, perhaps? Does the stress of debunking alter their reasoning somehow, degrade it maybe? How does it feel from the inside? I&#39;ve seen some curious patterns, but don&#39;t want to bias you. 

The easy recent example: Hofstadter and GPT-3, see [Scott&#39;s 53rd point](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-june-1e7) and [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vp23id/quality_contributions_report_for_june_2022/iej8xel/).  

What are your examples? And if you know any more systematic sources: I&#39;d be much obliged.

I was reading about that [Russian fox experiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox). Domesticated traits started to occur only after the second generation. After six generations you had a few hyper-domesticated foxes and by the 20th generation 30% of foxes constituted this hyper-domesticated status. 

The Christian social system appears especially conducive to domestication.  Only those with especially prosocial tendencies will get the most out of services; those with especially “domesticated” qualities will be graded best by peers according to the Christian rubric of grading another’s behavior; greater voluntary activity within the church would draw in the especially prosocial, creating prosocial pairings similar to in the Fox experiment. Those who best internalized the behavioral proscriptions of the Church had the highest status, and this obedience is a kind of domestication. Traits like intelligence, humor, and athleticism have no real value in the historically Christian social system, although a minimum amount of intelligence was probably necessary to secure a mate.

Compare to what (little) we know about Paganism. Paganism had no such fixation on domesticated qualities.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/iflb2gs/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifkwy7m/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Are some smart people just naturally gullible?

My boyfriend is extremely gullible. Sometimes he&#39;ll send me instagram posts of literal fake news (not really partisan, more like tabloid-esque &#39;the Queen has cancer and 30 days to live&#39; headlines, or &#39;PROOF Rishi Sunak responsible for taking Partygate photos&#39;, ie., things that are plausible but also functionally made-up by the post); he sometimes struggles to tell whether some mockumentaries are fictional until 10-15 minutes in. Objectively he&#39;s very intelligent according to widely held IQ proxies, test scores, grades, his job and so on. But I&#39;m sometimes stunned at his lack of scepticism, I&#39;m actually very worried that one day someone could trick him into a stupid investment or into being mugged by leading him into an alleyway under false pretences or something. 

Do you know people like this (maybe you&#39;re together with one)? Is there a solution or do I just have to live with this concern?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifkwy7m/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
