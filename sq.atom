It seems like whenever someone says it does, the response is to point to studies looking at whether it can change who the person in power. These studies point to the answer being no.

My question, then, is whether anyone has looked at this from the perspective of a politician?

1. Politicians want to have more votes and more money to run their campaigns. Having someone drop out of supporting you is something they should be sensitive to. Politicians may weigh their incentives and goals if two or more contradict, but I don&#39;t think any politician declares a level of support beyond which they will not allow any donations/support to change their policy goals.

2. Politicians may believe that campaign spending **does** affect the outcome of an election, so they act as if it does and strive to not lose large donators.

Now, these are just hypothesis, so I&#39;m looking to see if there are any studies testing them for validity.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/iltkd69/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilcwl5b/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">I took apart the drain for reasons.

The tall white pipe goes to the grey pipe. The U-pipe connects the tall white pipe to the one leading into the wall.

The pieces do assemble in something resembling a pipe, and water gets through them, but the connection is way too loose and water leaks all over the place.

There is this rubber washer where the U-pipe means the straight white pipe and it does not feel like it is seated right.

Is there a trick or a correct order to do these things?

One topic that has captured my attention recently is the structure of bureaucracies and mechanisms for accountability and efficiency leading to the question below:

**Are accountability and efficiency for a government organization mutually exclusive? Is there an agency/department (U.S. or non-U.S.) that is regarded as possessing both?**

It strikes me from work in the U.S. public sector that the old observation that the government moves slowly to be true. 

Anecdotally, it seems the slowness stems from countless procedures of reviews to ensure legal and policy compliance. Multiple offices all cover similar portfolios with numerous redundancies and these offices will collaborate to draft policy and regulations. Policy drafts will then undergo legal review by multiple lawyers (with the severity of the policy determining just how high up the bureaucratic lawyer-chain it must go). Further compounding the wait time is after the legal review, you typically have to add on the wait time for a government executive to review the policy, receive a briefing on it (if they desire), and then approve it.

Colleagues and managers claim all of this is to ensure the organizations involved did their due diligence in the name of public interest. To them, fewer layers of review may speed things along, but that arrangement would open said policy/regulation to greater risk, whether in the form of a legal challenge or unintended consequence. I however wonder if there is an example of a government organization with processes that disprove this assertion. Must a government organization move slow to be accountable?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilcqjvm/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilc7l68/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Got my first reddit cares notice.

Isn’t consumerism and inequity better to focus on, as it wastes more resources more flagrantly? For instance, Jeff Bezos wasting resources on yachts and so on, while squeezing the lowest workers dry; financial sector employees wasting resources on fancy things, while taking over companies to fire the slightly inefficient employees. Our system seems hyperfocused on inefficiencies of the lower class, while almost completely ignoring the inefficiencies of the upper class re: resource utilization. Consider how the upper echelon of Walmart waste exorbitant resources on multiple mansions, needless cars, needless trips, etc. It makes me wonder whether unionization and labor bargaining wouldn’t ultimately be more resource-efficient, as a way to prevent Bezosian wastefulness. 

Like sure, we could fire warehouse Bob because we can force warehouse Joe to do his job, if we cut Joe’s breaks down to 15 minutes and prevent him from talking at the water cooler. And if this existence is unlivable we can replace him with Juan when he dies from a fentanyl overdose. Or Bob and Joe can band together and fire Office Edward, who takes home extra resources akin to 40 Bobs a year, and wastes them buying vodka with gold flakes in it. Which one is really immoral and deserving of efficiency-finding? I refuse to believe Office Edward is actually that valuable in terms of what he brings to the company, having known Office Edward, and MBA programs are a meme. Maybe it’s better for society for Bob and Joe to get some slack versus Edward getting 1000x the slack.

This question is kind of reinventing the wheel, but this is the angle I’m trying to look at.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilc7b6h/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilc7269/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Is there actually any evidence that sexual activity before a certain age is harm</title><updated>2022-08-22T16:20:44Z</updated><author><name>MacaqueOfTheNorth</name></author><content type="text">Is there actually any evidence that sexual activity before a certain age is harmful and if so, is it actually less harmful if the other person is close in age?

As you can guess by the demographics of this sub, preferably fantasy/scifi or nonfiction history.

If anyone else is looking for something, I&#39;ve really enjoyed the bobbiverse series (4th book is out, if anyone read/heard the first 3 and liked them), it&#39;s exactly at the perfect line of engaging enough to stay interesting but also not too complicated and not too action-laden so that I love to hear it in the evening/night to calm down. Basic premise is that the main character is an AI replicant of a human that existed at some point, trying to cope with his new existence as a von Neumann probe. He ultimately builds up an interstellar empire, the bobbiverse, entirely consisting of clones of himself. It&#39;s not super deep but handles many different topics, most of them reasonably well, without devolving into an author tract. For the most part refreshingly positive in attitude, which is unusual in scifi in my experience.

The First Law Trilogy, which I think was recommended here before, is okay. It&#39;s reasonably recent but is heavily reminiscent of 90s dark gritty fantasy, in both bad and good ways. A bit slow start though, and I saw the ending coming from a mile, both of which diminished my fun significantly. But the author does avoid all the most common pitfalls, like getting too overly grimdark , obvious self inserts/mary sue etc. .

&#34;The Murderbot Diaries&#34; is something I&#39;ve recently heard as well, but can&#39;t really recommend. Also with a sentient AI as the MC, it starts out as a decent if a bit repetitious contender in the &#34;dark gritty scifi comedy&#34;, but after some time the politics of the author become increasingly clear and it devolves into extremely simple black (corporations) vs white (nonbinary environmentally friendly slavery abolishing scientist communist utopia). If you like the premise, read/hear the first few stories, but don&#39;t expect it to hold up long.

All three however have decent speakers and are enjoyable to listen to.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilb4fkt/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilab9wd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">So, this is going to be a case of &#34;sheltered religious conservative doesn&#39;t unde</title><updated>2022-08-22T05:16:44Z</updated><author><name>urquan5200</name></author><content type="text">So, this is going to be a case of &#34;sheltered religious conservative doesn&#39;t understand slang&#34; but... what is a fuckboy?

Is that it? I dunno, I guess it just seems like that&#39;s a very imprecise definition for a word like that.

I went out with a hot girl and described myself as sort of autistic.  Assume a decent amount of people here are in that group.  And nowadays that’s databale.

So I guess my question is what’s like an autistic versus I’m a normie who can do math.  I guess musks claimed it but is he really that or just smart?

I&#39;ve written some books, nothing amazing and nothing I&#39;m going to tell you about here.

I had this thought though and a question follows from it - AI is writing an awful lot of stuff. 

My question is - 

What measures have the creators of AI made to make sure they either don&#39;t violate my copyright or where they do but under fair use they attribute correctly to myself/another author?

Similar questions related to artwork spring to mind - are the AI blocked from creating already existing and protected images?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/il8e07e/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/il85eue/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">So, what are you reading?

I&#39;m picking up Kamachi&#39;s *A Certain Magical Index*, book 1. The anime was...fascinating in strange ways. Every time the topic was science, it was incredibly compelling. On the other hand, every time the topic was magic, it was horribly dull. This had the unfortunate effect of making the show boring whenever Touma was on-screen, and the very fortunate effect of making the spin-off anime *A Certain Scientific Railgun* excellent. My theory is that the writer has a respectable IQ and excellent writing talent, so whenever there&#39;s some real-world basis (however distant) for his thoughts like the science parts, it&#39;s hard not to be sucked in. But whenever the topic is based on non-empirical things, all we get is a jumble of complex thoughts that can&#39;t be understood unless you&#39;re the author.

On reflection, Academy City is a very dark dream, a place where every citizen is an experiment, everyone is complicit, and criminality is institutionalized. Nevertheless the peace of the everyday lives of the characters is the true focus, together with a desire to hold on to gratitude at having met the people they call friends, despite the nature of the place that they met them in. Hopefully the book will bring out more of the compelling side of this author by giving more breathing room to his thoughts.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/il85eue/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/il7repi/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Where are all the East Asian CEOs?

As background, I took an AP Comp Sci class in highschool, and then mostly didn&#39;t do programming in undergrad except occasionally messing around on my calculator as I majored in Math.  In grad school, I ended up drifting more in the direction of game theory, and started doing mathematical modeling, which gradually become more and more of my emphasis until now as a postdoc that&#39;s pretty much all that I do.  I create a mathematical model that models some scenario, program it, explore the results of the model and tweak stuff, and then write and publish results about it.

Also, I program almost exclusively in Java because that&#39;s what I learned in highschool, though I have dabbled in a couple other languages.

So I do a lot of programming, but it&#39;s all self-contained stuff meant for my own use, and mostly self-taught via googling things whenever I need to know how to do something.  I&#39;m pretty good at taking a thing I need to do and hacking together the right steps and loops in the right order to make it work, but I suspect a more well-studied programmer would look at my spaghetti code in horror.  In particular, I suspect that my main flaws are

1. Lack of comments.  I sometimes write them, but often don&#39;t because I know what I&#39;m doing in the moment and also keep changing things on the fly

2. Lack of optimization.  I&#39;m aware that this is a thing, and the general idea.  I can make sure I don&#39;t use like a O(n^3 ) structure if a O(n^2 ) will do or something, but I haven&#39;t learned like common techniques for recognizing shortcuts that save processing time, or like this function nobody ever uses because it&#39;s ten times less efficient than this equivalent function.

3. General project organization?  Like, I separate stuff into classes and methods, and try to keep them organized nicely, but often it ends up as spaghetti code and when I want to do multiple algorithms that are similar but with slightly different steps, I&#39;m never sure whether to copy/paste a new method and change stuff there, or try to make one method more robust with booleans to toggle different steps on and off.  And like, planning ahead to make stuff more robust ahead of time and save time in the future.


Stuff like that.  And just general practices.  As I&#39;m looking towards possibly moving out of academia and into industry, I&#39;m worried my code will look very amateur and be hard for other people to use if I end up collaborating with people and/or designing something used by someone other than myself.  I&#39;m hoping to find some sort of resource that I can use to learn techniques for code design/structure/planning/efficiency, without wasting my time on basics of how to code in the first place that I already know.

I&#39;m talking obscure but reasonable.

I feel like everybody in Forums/subreddits like these, talks with an undercurrent of belonging to the shadow government looking down on society discussing how to rearrange it.

That may sound elitist and maybe even an insult but it is way better than being in a comment section where people are insulting each other over grammatical errors.
