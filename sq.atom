He was the culmination of a revolution between a far right and a far left. He took control undemocratically, became Emperor, and both sides were just… okay with it. Widespread support, yet dictatorial; attempted to balance the Left and Right, but motivated by personal ambition.

There’s something illustrative in this whole thing, but I’m too lazy to read Thomas Carlyle. It’s almost like both sides simply wanted practical improvements and a good story, and Napoleon more than sufficed.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igq8pkg/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igq05ea/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">This comment&#39;s just a notice to anyone who might be recreating my personality so</title><updated>2022-07-19T01:41:30Z</updated><author><name>TJ11240</name></author><content type="text">This comment&#39;s just a notice to anyone who might be recreating my personality some time in the future through all these years&#39; worth of comments, I&#39;d like to remind you I&#39;m usually working on a buzz in the evenings so that probably should be accounted for.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igq05ea/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igo3c52/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[deleted]</title><updated>2022-07-18T17:45:28Z</updated><author><name>[deleted]</name></author><content type="text">[deleted]</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igo3c52/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/ignl1wi/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Not sure if it&#39;s the correct thread to post this.

I remembered [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vlopk0/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_june_27_2022/idwelna/) by /u/ZorbaTHut about trying to generalize the problem of (supposedly existing) people who can&#39;t understand conditionals. And I wonder if there&#39;s any connection with inability to understand pointers and recursion by some people described [here](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/). Indirection?

&amp;gt; I’ve come to realize that **understanding pointers in C is not a skill, it’s an aptitude**. In first year computer science classes, there are always about 200 kids at the beginning of the semester, all of whom wrote complex adventure games in BASIC for their PCs when they were 4 years old. They are having a good ol’ time learning C or Pascal in college, until one day the professor introduces pointers, and suddenly, they don’t get it.

&amp;gt; They just don’t understand anything any more. 90% of the class goes off and becomes Political Science majors, then they tell their friends that there weren’t enough good looking members of the appropriate sex in their CompSci classes, that’s why they switched. **For some reason most people seem to be born without the part of the brain that understands pointers. Pointers require a complex form of doubly-indirected thinking that some people just can’t do**, and it’s pretty crucial to good programming. A lot of the “script jocks” who started programming by copying JavaScript snippets into their web pages and went on to learn Perl never learned about pointers, and they can never quite produce code of the quality you need.

&amp;gt; That’s the source of all these famous interview questions you hear about, like “reversing a linked list” or “detect loops in a tree structure.”


Through now that I checked, recursion was already covered in that 4chan post Scott referenced

&amp;gt; Other interesting phenomenon around IQ involves recursion. For example: &#34;Write a story with two named characters, each of whom have at least one line of dialogue.&#34; Most literate people can manage this, especially once you give them an example. &#34;Write a story with two named characters, each of whom have at least one line of dialogue. In this story, one of the characters must be describing a story with at least two named characters, each of whom have at least one line of dialogue.&#34; If you have less than 90 IQ, this second exercise is basically completely impossible. Add a third level (&#39;frame&#39;) to the story, and even IQ 100&#39;s start to get mixed up with the names and who&#39;s talking. Turns out Scheherazade was an IQ test!
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Time is practically impossible to understand for sub 80s. They exist only in the present, can barely reflect on the past and can&#39;t plan for the future at all. Sub 90s struggle with anachronism too. For example, I remember the 80-85s stumbling on logic problems that involved common sense anachronism stuff. For instance: &#34;Why do you think that military strategists in WWII didn&#39;t use laptop computers to help develop their strategies?&#34; &#34;I guess they didn&#39;t want to get hacked by Nazis&#34;. Admittedly you could argue that this is a history knowledge question, not quite a logic sequencing question, but you get the idea. Sequencing is super hard for them to track, but most 100+ have no problem with it, although I imagine that a movie like Memento strains them a little. Recursion was definitely the killer though. Recursive thinking and recursive knowledge seems genuinely hard for people of even average intelligence.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/ignl1wi/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igmj9y6/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">I&#39;m looking for a study that shows that teaching quality is more important for g</title><updated>2022-07-18T10:20:46Z</updated><author><name>Greenei</name></author><content type="text">I&#39;m looking for a study that shows that teaching quality is more important for good students than bad students, i.e. the learning achievements of good students increase more quickly with teacher quality.

For me personally, compulsive snooping. I can&#39;t not snoop. When I start a job, I tell people, look I&#39;m a snoop, don&#39;t leave files open a file on my computer and expect me not to read it, don&#39;t leave a confidential letter open on the conference table when we&#39;re meeting there, don&#39;t have a &#34;private&#34; conversation in the car with me, I will read/listen/etc. Can&#39;t help myself. My wife and I are the same way, and as a result we&#39;ve always kept phone passwords because we just can&#39;t help ourselves and it&#39;s too much information to share.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igjsk8b/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igjglwo/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">So, what are you reading?

I&#39;m reading Nystrom&#39;s *Project of a New System of Arithmetic*, which makes the case for switching to a hexadecimal system for things like clocks (seems like a 16-hour day with 90 decimal minutes per hour?). Skimming it shows that he somehow applies hexadecimal to other things like music.

F</title><updated>2022-07-17T13:27:30Z</updated><author><name>Difficult_Ad_3879</name></author><content type="text">Why is it so uncommon to factor for the malleability of value in our beliefs?

For instance, if I am a feminist, it’s important to factor in the fact that people can be reared to value *either* feminist values *or* traditional values. Humans are this malleable, that they can be raised to value particular things according to what they consume and how they model rewards. Men, for instance, can be raised to value the Spartan way of life, the Athenian way of life, or the Puritan way of life. By simply changing some variables we can have people value different things.

This is important, because it means we can just think dispassionately “what is best for the whole of society”, without much care for what people happen to value at this particular point, ourselves included. I have little doubt that if I were born a Spartan I would love war and that if I were born a Puritan I would love prayer. People did not historically deviate from their culture’s values except in times of strong propaganda against the values, eg counterculture 60’s with their strong and vivid media.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igikeu1/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igifq3r/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">How many people here actually own a firearm, and if you don&#39;t mind saying, is it</title><updated>2022-07-17T12:43:00Z</updated><author><name>ChrisPrattAlphaRaptr</name></author><content type="text">How many people here actually own a firearm, and if you don&#39;t mind saying, is it a hunting rifle/handgun/AR style whatever?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igifq3r/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
