    "body": "Does the opposite of the Gambler's Fallacy have merit?\n\nThe tldr on the Gambler's Fallacy is this \"We're flipping a coin. It hit heads the last 4 times, so we're due a tails this next time.\" But, the law of independent variables tells us that's BS. Each flip is independent, and so the odds of hitting tails doesn't go up each time you hit heads.\n\nBut, does the odds of a heads *increase* for each heads previously flipped?\n\nI want to argue yes, and yeah, I'm aware of the Hot Hand Fallacy. But here's my idea...\n\nAfter some improbable number of consecutive heads flipping (and this is important) *the same coin*, the odds that the coin isn't fair increases. Cheating starts to become a better explanation than just chance.\n\nAnd this becomes apparent at the extreme. Imagine a coin has been flipped 1 million times, heads all 1 million of them. Then we flip a million and oneth time. What are the odds of heads? It's not 50/50, because the 1 million previous flips are basically proof positive that the coin is rigged.\n\nIf that last million-flip example makes sense, I'd wonder where is the number of flips where we start to think there's a meaningful deviation from the 50/50 prediction.",

It's a  perhaps overly literate space opera series from early 1990s, and while some of it has aged gracefully (e.g. in the future, everyone has a smartphone and/or comm implants and people get withdrawals if they're deprived) .. there are some parts that really didn't.\n\n(set cca 2600 or so)\n\n&gt;I was thinking about how free of mobs recent centuries had been: **to create a mob there must be public meetings,** and public meetings in our time consisted of individuals communing via the All Thing or other datasphere channels; it is hard to create mob passion when people are separated by kilometers and light-years, connected only by comm lines and fatline threads.\n\nIndeed, it seems  that networking supercharges mobs, and the networked ones are even worse than the physical  ones.

    "body": "I don’t know if observing other niche communities is frowned upon here, but I recently ran across an external forum that is totally fascinating. It’s a fairly large and active community of Christian polygamists. They’re not associated with a denomination (definitely not Mormon) and seems to be legitimate biblical scholars. They have reasoned their way into polygamy with carful reading of scripture. If you liked watching Big Love and want to really see how modern polygamists live. Here’s your shot. \n\nSome observations:\n\n* They seems to be quite persecuted within mainstream Christiandom. As you would expect.\n* They also seem to be quite intelligent and know the Bible inside and out. They can support their position quite well and it seems difficult find a flaw in their logic. As a Catholic, I can’t say that I’m an expert on scripture and the only argument I have against their logic is that The Church has taken a very diffierent view on sex and marriage. Without having The Church as an authority, I don’t know how evangelicals who stick to the Bible as ultimate authority can pin these people down. \n* There does seem to be some motivated reasoning going on here. Some posters are clearly looking to justify their lust and build a harem, but most seem to be quite sincere. \n* The community is surprisingly healthy with lots of activity and very collegial users. Reminds me of themotte in some ways. \n\nI find the whole thing fascinating. Besides the whole intellectual discussion of polygamy and the Bible there are quite of few gems in here. Ever want to see a bunch of Christian men painstakingly discuss whether or not lesbiansism between sister wives is a sin (spoiler: it’s not)? Ever want to see full throated defense and encorgament of patriarchy? I’ve always loved to observe these types of communities that I would otherwise not know about. Reminds me of early internet days. \n\nI won’t link to the the forum, but you can google christian polygamy forum and find it quite easily. \n\nEnjoy.",
