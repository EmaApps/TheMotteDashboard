    "body": "Lex Fridman [interviewed](https://youtu.be/0ZO28NtkwwQ) Magnus Carlsen today. He may have used one of my requested questions, but I can’t tell as they were vague. Magnus is the most interesting case study of performance psychology because he’s so beyond his competition, in what amounts to the most competitive cognitive game in the world. \n\nSome interesting bits from the interview:\n\n* Magnus does not like practicing with puzzles. Neither does he consider himself good at stand-alone puzzles. \n\n* Magnus hates strict, organized practice. He refused to do this as a child and instead enjoyed exploring interesting parts from books he takes a liking to. When he was younger he “fired” Kasparov as a coach (one of the best players of all time) because Kasparov wanted Magnus to analyze his past mistakes, which he found annoying.\n\n* The above two bits are shocking as it flies in the face of our understanding of deliberate practice. But actually, maybe not! While it’s true that puzzles can be construed as very specific deliberate practice, you come across the scenarios in games anyway, in their “natural habitat” surrounded by other information; so playing difficult games is probably better than specialized puzzles. \n\n* While focusing on past major mistakes could be seen as optimal deliberate practice, it’s also highly demotivating. Magnus’ practice is odd in that he appears to choose the most motivating path. He reads from books guided by pleasure, and he ignores strict puzzle-based practices. He favors playing games, and if you notice, he very often plays these games with variable strategy in mind. Instead of focusing on one opening, when he plays online he frequently changes openings, tests out things he doesn’t know will work, etc. This is excellent deliberate, variable practice while maintaining motivation.\n\n* While Magnus was the poster child of athletic chess players, in recent years he has fallen out of shape. I find it interesting that he favors sports games over weightlifting or cardio. This has a motivational component, because when he’s playing tennis for an hour or two he’s in a state of competition. I think this extra “competitiveness practice” aids him in chess. \n\nSo I find it interesting that Magnus’ approach to chess prioritizes competition and motivation. I also find it interesting to think that if Magnus were placed in chess school with dry exercises and exams, he probably wouldn’t even make it in the top 200 students. He has a strong aversion to boring practice and is chiefly motivated by real competitive wins, and he’s not good at chess “practice puzzles”. This says a lot about modern schooling: what other talents are we missing out on because we focus on dry, boring practice problems that do not directly translate to real life? Have we missed out on Henry Fords and Da Vinci’s?",

    "body": "I'm making a stupid parody game that I'm planning to have devolve into a horror scenario with humor elements, before circling the entire thing around to be a jab at a certain politician in another country with whom I have no beef. Anyway, via the game [Space Funeral](https://thecatamites.itch.io/space-funeral), which is a free and excellent two to three hour experience that feels like you're traversing a slightly humorous nightmare, I've become more interested in older experimental music as a means of communicating an atmosphere of horror so that I can bundle it up with my already growing pile of copyright infringement. This has led me down the rabbit hole of early synthesizer music, starting with [Delia Derbyshire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsqxNy8kkg) with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Most recently, I've been delving into Japanese Synthesizer stuff, which is frequently very pretty...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRZch8wSeII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRZch8wSeII)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj9CARDiBj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj9CARDiBj8)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIqrqqKt12Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIqrqqKt12Q)\n\nAnd then, there's 70s-80s French experimental music, which is good at stoking a sense of terror and sometimes downright miserable to listen to (as also is Derbyshire)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQL8GHzkcwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQL8GHzkcwM)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHudu1Am6oQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHudu1Am6oQ)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay2yxt08Ed0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay2yxt08Ed0)\n\nNot all the music I've posted is good. A lot of it is discordant. But Space Funeral is pretty fun and if you know any other cool early synthesizer stuff that's good at creating an ambience, please shoot it over. Anyways, I am complete newb to this stuff and am not sure of how much interest it would be to anyone else. At very least, it you need to terrorize trick or treaters or your significant other during Halloween, some of these tracks will do a good job.",

    "body": "So I'm still greatly enjoying Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but I had to take a week off to travel.\n\nThe job system hasn't really opened up as much as I'd hoped.  I'm like, 40 hours into the game, and all my jobs are still capped at level 10.  I can clearly see they go up to level 20, I just have no idea when/how I uncap them.  Will it be story related, or a sidequest?  I guess I'll find out.  But that obnoxious cap turns the job system from something fun, to a chore where I'm constantly rejiggering my party's jobs because someone hit their cap, and I don't want XP to goto waste.  I can't fucking wait for the cap to go away.\n\nThe story is **very** Xenoblade.  If you've played one, you know what I mean.\n\nThe geography and world design at first seemed very bog standard.  It's gotten much more creative and alien as I've gone along.  It's funny though, because Xenoblade 1 and 2 both started off with monologs about \"This game takes place on the back of a giant titan(s)\".  Xenoblade 3 just throws you in, with no explanation about the construction or orientation of the world.  I think it's still taking place on a titan?  Maybe the corpses of the titans from the first two games?  I don't know.  It'll be interesting if they just never fucking tell you, but I think I'd like at least a few more hints.",
