    "body": "After not listening to it for several years, I've recently revisited \"Vessels\" by the Australian melodic death metal band Be'lakor. It is a brilliant record; I think it's one of the crowning jewels of the genre both musically and in lyrical poetry.\n\nIt's a concept album, tracing the journey of the energy of a photon of light. Each song is its own self-contained story, starting with the entrance of this bit of energy into a life and ending with the extinguishing of that life's light and the energy's departure. It starts in the fusion forges of the sun, in [An Ember's Arc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyuDOVm8TG4):\n\n&gt; This cascade of embers,\n\n&gt; Fused into a star's ignition\n\n&gt; A crucible for their collapse,\n\n&gt; Seething crux of its ambition\n\n&gt; ---\n\n&gt; The axiom of this expanse,\n\n&gt; Unrelenting pressure\n\n&gt; Every moment, in each place,\n\n&gt; Collisions beyond measure\n\n&gt; ---\n\n&gt; An ordinary pair that met,\n\n&gt; Whilst merging into one,\n\n&gt; Heaved and spat a mote of light,\n\n&gt; Adrift within the Sun\n\nand it ends in the funeral pyre of a man in [The Smoke of Many Fires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARI0XyTiips):\n\n&gt; Like billions before him regardless of form\n\n&gt; It ended as chance had decided\n\n&gt; So briefly contained an inferno's refrain\n\n&gt; Having powered and angered and guided\n\n&gt; ---\n\n&gt; At the heart of the blaze awareness dissolved\n\n&gt; Light ascended devoid of desire\n\n&gt; From a trail intertwined life and death strewn behind\n\n&gt; To the stars it returned from the fire",

A number of the sites are extremely high quality and clearly received considerable investment from the US government. I almost skipped it, but I’m glad I stopped at the [cemetery at Omaha beach ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_American_Cemetery_and_Memorial). The grounds are beautiful, and I found the experience of seeing the graves of so many young men surprisingly moving.",
