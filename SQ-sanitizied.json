    "body": "What makes someone autistic?  I went out with a hot girl and described myself as sort of autistic.  Assume a decent amount of people here are in that group.  And nowadays that’s databale.  Like I have text receipts where I got in an argument with someone and they made fun of me for being autistic.  Sort of work in HFT.  I went to math tournaments as a kid.  So I guess my question is what’s like an autistic versus I’m a normie who can do math.  I guess musks claimed it but is he really that or just smart?  Nowadays it’s beneficial to just let people put you in that group.",

    "body": "So, what are you reading?\n\nI'm picking up Kamachi's *A Certain Magical Index*, book 1. The anime was...fascinating in strange ways. Every time the topic was science, it was incredibly compelling. On the other hand, every time the topic was magic, it was horribly dull. This had the unfortunate effect of making the show boring whenever Touma was on-screen, and the very fortunate effect of making the spin-off anime *A Certain Scientific Railgun* excellent. My theory is that the writer has a respectable IQ and excellent writing talent, so whenever there's some real-world basis (however distant) for his thoughts like the science parts, it's hard not to be sucked in. But whenever the topic is based on non-empirical things, all we get is a jumble of complex thoughts that can't be understood unless you're the author.\n\nOn reflection, Academy City is a very dark dream, a place where every citizen is an experiment, everyone is complicit, and criminality is institutionalized. Nevertheless the peace of the everyday lives of the characters is the true focus, together with a desire to hold on to gratitude at having met the people they call friends, despite the nature of the place that they met them in. Hopefully the book will bring out more of the compelling side of this author by giving more breathing room to his thoughts.",

    "body": "How do I learn better techniques and standard practices for coding, given a amateurish knowledge do-it-yourself background, without wasting my time on basic stuff I already know?\n\n\nAs background, I took an AP Comp Sci class in highschool, and then mostly didn't do programming in undergrad except occasionally messing around on my calculator as I majored in Math.  In grad school, I ended up drifting more in the direction of game theory, and started doing mathematical modeling, which gradually become more and more of my emphasis until now as a postdoc that's pretty much all that I do.  I create a mathematical model that models some scenario, program it, explore the results of the model and tweak stuff, and then write and publish results about it.\n\nAlso, I program almost exclusively in Java because that's what I learned in highschool, though I have dabbled in a couple other languages.\n\nSo I do a lot of programming, but it's all self-contained stuff meant for my own use, and mostly self-taught via googling things whenever I need to know how to do something.  I'm pretty good at taking a thing I need to do and hacking together the right steps and loops in the right order to make it work, but I suspect a more well-studied programmer would look at my spaghetti code in horror.  In particular, I suspect that my main flaws are\n\n1. Lack of comments.  I sometimes write them, but often don't because I know what I'm doing in the moment and also keep changing things on the fly\n\n2. Lack of optimization.  I'm aware that this is a thing, and the general idea.  I can make sure I don't use like a O(n^3 ) structure if a O(n^2 ) will do or something, but I haven't learned like common techniques for recognizing shortcuts that save processing time, or like this function nobody ever uses because it's ten times less efficient than this equivalent function.\n\n3. General project organization?  Like, I separate stuff into classes and methods, and try to keep them organized nicely, but often it ends up as spaghetti code and when I want to do multiple algorithms that are similar but with slightly different steps, I'm never sure whether to copy/paste a new method and change stuff there, or try to make one method more robust with booleans to toggle different steps on and off.  And like, planning ahead to make stuff more robust ahead of time and save time in the future.\n\n\nStuff like that.  And just general practices.  As I'm looking towards possibly moving out of academia and into industry, I'm worried my code will look very amateur and be hard for other people to use if I end up collaborating with people and/or designing something used by someone other than myself.  I'm hoping to find some sort of resource that I can use to learn techniques for code design/structure/planning/efficiency, without wasting my time on basics of how to code in the first place that I already know.\n\nAny suggestions or comments are welcome.",
