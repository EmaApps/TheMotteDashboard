    "body": "\"Cop faces\": to what extent are facial features actually predictive of personality? Do meaningful population substructures among, say, white Anglos exist that would correlate with something like authoritarian personality?\n\nI keep circling back to a certain pattern I seem to see, where a person famous for authoritarian or \"meddlesome violent pro-social\" behaviour turns out to have a facial features that register as similar in some relevant way according to my visual system. The behaviour they exhibit is always a certain palpable glee in public criticism, punishment and humiliation of perceived rule-breakers, especially as such rules are widely agreed upon by society. The cleanest example is the proprietor of [krebsonsecurity](https://krebsonsecurity.com/about/), who is a security blogger who moonlights in investigating random Eastern European credit card flippers and botnet operators and publishes their flailing as they get caught and apologetic letters they seem to send to him personally from jail. Next exhibit is [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY1kMZp36IQSyNx_9h4mpCg), a Youtuber who started out in generic DIY tinkering but then pivoted to overengineered revenge plots against package thieves and online scammers. [Matthew Green](https://isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/) is a cryptographer recently in the news for attacking another cryptographer for suing the NIST for not releasing details on NSA meddling in the post-quantum cryptography standardisation process (so basically carrying water for the NSA), but he seems to be at the outer edges of the (visual) category to me. [John McCain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain) was a famous person whose face is closer to a central example, but I don't know enough about the man beyond him having being a seemingly very principled and rule-bound Republican. On top of that, I seem to see the average of these faces in an endless array of movie FBI agents and real-life US border control. \n\nDoes anyone else see the commonalities there, or is it just me? How plausible is it for a pattern like this to exist, and how specific would it be? Am I just seeing something quite general like Moldbug's Optimates or the distinguishing features one of the tribes of Albion's Seed, whose ethos and appearance both are stark to me by virtue of being culturally foreign? Could it be a narrower (hitherto unidentified, but perhaps actually sufficiently endogamous to maintain itself) genetically identifiable subgroup (of Anglo-Americans) with distinct temperament, or could there perhaps even be an almost inextricable facial correlate of certain personality traits every time selection pops them out, in the same way in which canids get [domestication syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_syndrome)?",

Not sure if I'm interested enough, but he was a pioneer in cognitive therapies. So far he seems to have added a layer on top of behavioural conditioning, where the words that people use to \"self-indoctrinate\" themselves function as a reward/punishment mechanism. So even if you use Freudian analysis to reveal the roots of someone's problems, you still have to deal with the mechanism by which those problems are reinforced. He argues that these self-indoctrinating words often hide irrational premises, which, when noticed and challenged, leads to improvement.\n\nTo be honest, the simplicity of the model (I suppose it will get more complex) raises an eyebrow, but perhaps I'll learn something useful. It is true enough that kneading one's resentments like dough is a questionable use of time that often goes unchecked.",

    "body": "To engage in a not-serious thought experiment (please don't take this too seriously, it's only for fun, not an actual proposal):\n\n**What if we just banned advertising?**\n\nWith obvious certain exemptions for public service announcements and the like, but no advertising generally for commercial products was allowed. People would be able to seek out information on products and services (via catalogues, websites etc), but this cannot be integrated into media not explicitly meant for that purpose.\n\nThe US advertising industry alone is worth almost US$300 billion. That $300 billion has an opportunity cost - that is theoretically $300 billion of labor, resources etc that could be spent something else to benefit society as a whole. While advertising may generate economic value to an individual or a company competing against others, it doesn't generate *wealth* for the economy as a whole. Advertising isn't producing a good or service that materially benefits society. It may be the case that the advertising industry is a leech on the economy as a whole, sucking away productivity that could be better spent elsewhere.\n\n\nAdvertising has often been described as a Prisoner's Dilemma. Companies constantly spend more and more on marketing and advertising to keep ahead of their competition, and there maybe be a tipping point where the money spent on advertising exceeds gains and all parties would have been better off if no one spend money on advertising in the first place. Of course, one of the ways to solve the Prisoner's Dilemma is to have an external agent force compliance and avoid defection. In this case, the government. \n\nOf course, there are some counter arguments:\n\n1. While advertising doesn't generate wealth itself, it can assist in generating wealth by making people want things (consumerism). When people want things, they will engage in economic activity to acquire said things. This extra economic activity is a net good, and (arguably) leads to innovation and invention. There is a quote I can't quite remember that exactly - \"Advertising is the lifeblood of the economy\". The counter-counter argument to this is a consumerist economy is not a good thing in the first place, and people should be driven by their 'organic' needs and wants rather than what advertising has told them they should want or need. i.e. standard anti-consumerism argument. Additionally, advertising might cause people to engaging in behavior that causes actual harm, with the most poignant example that pharmaceutical advertising may play significant role in the opioid crisis, overmedication of kids etc. The obesity epidemic being fueled by junk/fast food advertising might be another example.\n\n2. Advertising provides a source of funding for industries and institutions that couldn't otherwise exist without it. Journalism, entertainment media, some forms of art, sports might be some examples of this, where a significant part of there revenue is generated from advertising that they couldn't exist without, and we think these things are a net good. The counter-counter argument is that many of those things can exist via alternative (or original!) revenue models (e.g. charging more for a newspaper, ticket sales), and in fact advertising has resulted in perverse incentives that have corrupted those industries and institutions, e.g. advertising in journalism has incentivized clickbait and outrage rather than investigative, 'real' journalism, which causes harm to society, which is a net negative.\n\n3. The advertising industry does provide a benefit by providing insights into human psychology and communication that has benefits for society elsewhere (the same way NASA/the space race provided inventions and innovations that could be adapted to benefit the public, but on a psychological level). The counter-counter argument is that this is hard to quantify, doesn't fully address the issue of opportunity cost, only lessens its impact, and it might actually be a net moral negative as it allows the powers that be to engage in social manipulation and engineering we don't like.",

Randomly pop up and ruin my mood. Now the part worth noting here is that its not disturbing in the traditional sense; gore, etc.. But in a more metaphysical/psychological sense. To put it shortly similar to how the main character in Crime and Punishment felt. \n\nFor example. Lets say I didn't treat a person the most kindly. Or lost my temper, or acted along those lines. The following weeks. I will get imagery of that person mutilated in a car accident. Or withering away in a hospital bed, or something of the sort. \n\nNow as far as the average person is concerned.
