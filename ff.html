One day I heard that one of their leaders had died.  They laid him forthwith in a grave which they covered up for ten days till they had finished cutting-out and sewing his costume.  If the dead man is poor they make a little ship, put him in it, and burn it.  If he is wealthy, however, they divide his property and goods into three parts: one for his family, one to pay for his costume, and one to make nabid [probably a Scandinavian type of beer] which t...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/ShouldHaveVotedGore">u/ShouldHaveVotedGore</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/igg1gya/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-16 21:49:02 UTC">Jul 16, 21:49 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/igg1gya/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Got an old network attached storage device, HDD-based, that I&#39;d like to securely</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/igg1gya/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500"> erase.

The ascribed reasons vary, from differences in design to superstimuli alternatives like Tik Tok. But there’s an important element that has been missed: the fun of video games is in some sense *charged* from the boredom of everyday life. The more boredom you have habituated to in daily life, the more fun video games will be.

When childhood life around the 00’s and before consisted of boring schoolwork and activities, and you did not have the ability to find anything on YouTube and message your friends 24/7, the fun factor of video games stands out.

Marx’s “religion is the opium of the masses” is actually  &quot;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.&quot; Also opium was much more widely accepted in Europe at the time.
