* The stimulus that signals the end of a punishment, or is even *more toward the end* of a punishment, takes on positive valence in flies, mice, and (debated) humans. Not just *within the context of punishment*, but outside the context too. If you zap a mouse for a couple minutes and toward the end of the zap you play a certain sound, the mouse will “like” this sound and approach it outside the context. This is a kind of relief learning, where we begin to desire things that are associated with relief.

Refresher:

*Q: What is the point?*

Lower inhibition, lower effort conversations. While civility and order is maintained,  most of TheMotte rules do not apply. Why? Well, we do already have a place where they apply. Motte rules produce good discussions, but also constrain, so I thought there is value in  experimenting with something a little different. Chat format is a good fit for that - it has different architecture and features compared to a forum like this one.
