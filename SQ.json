As you can guess by the demographics of this sub, preferably fantasy/scifi or nonfiction history.\n\nIf anyone else is looking for something, I've really enjoyed the bobbiverse series (4th book is out, if anyone read/heard the first 3 and liked them), it's exactly at the perfect line of engaging enough to stay interesting but also not too complicated and not too action-laden so that I love to hear it in the evening/night to calm down. Basic premise is that the main character is an AI replicant of a human that existed at some point, trying to cope with his new existence as a von Neumann probe. He ultimately builds up an interstellar empire, the bobbiverse, entirely consisting of clones of himself. It's not super deep but handles many different topics, most of them reasonably well, without devolving into an author tract. For the most part refreshingly positive in attitude, which is unusual in scifi in my experience.\n\nThe First Law Trilogy, which I think was recommended here before, is okay. It's reasonably recent but is heavily reminiscent of 90s dark gritty fantasy, in both bad and good ways. A bit slow start though, and I saw the ending coming from a mile, both of which diminished my fun significantly. But the author does avoid all the most common pitfalls, like getting too overly grimdark , obvious self inserts/mary sue etc. .\n\n\"The Murderbot Diaries\" is something I've recently heard as well, but can't really recommend. Also with a sentient AI as the MC, it starts out as a decent if a bit repetitious contender in the \"dark gritty scifi comedy\", but after some time the politics of the author become increasingly clear and it devolves into extremely simple black (corporations) vs white (nonbinary environmentally friendly slavery abolishing scientist communist utopia).

Basic premise is that the main character is an AI replicant of a human that existed at some point, trying to cope with his new existence as a von Neumann probe. He ultimately builds up an interstellar empire, the bobbiverse, entirely consisting of clones of himself. It&amp;#39;s not super deep but handles many different topics, most of them reasonably well, without devolving into an author tract. For the most part refreshingly positive in attitude, which is unusual in scifi in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The First Law Trilogy, which I think was recommended here before, is okay. It&amp;#39;s reasonably recent but is heavily reminiscent of 90s dark gritty fantasy, in both bad and good ways.

In grad school, I ended up drifting more in the direction of game theory, and started doing mathematical modeling, which gradually become more and more of my emphasis until now as a postdoc that's pretty much all that I do.  I create a mathematical model that models some scenario, program it, explore the results of the model and tweak stuff, and then write and publish results about it.\n\nAlso, I program almost exclusively in Java because that's what I learned in highschool, though I have dabbled in a couple other languages.\n\nSo I do a lot of programming, but it's all self-contained stuff meant for my own use, and mostly self-taught via googling things whenever I need to know how to do something.  I'm pretty good at taking a thing I need to do and hacking together the right steps and loops in the right order to make it work, but I suspect a more well-studied programmer would look at my spaghetti code in horror.  In particular, I suspect that my main flaws are\n\n1. Lack of comments.  I sometimes write them, but often don't because I know what I'm doing in the moment and also keep changing things on the fly\n\n2. Lack of optimization.  I'm aware that this is a thing, and the general idea.  I can make sure I don't use like a O(n^3 ) structure if a O(n^2 ) will do or something, but I haven't learned like common techniques for recognizing shortcuts that save processing time, or like this function nobody ever uses because it's ten times less efficient than this equivalent function.\n\n3. General project organization?  Like, I separate stuff into classes and methods, and try to keep them organized nicely, but often it ends up as spaghetti code and when I want to do multiple algorithms that are similar but with slightly different steps, I'm never sure whether to copy/paste a new method and change stuff there, or try to make one method more robust with booleans to toggle different steps on and off.  And like, planning ahead to make stuff more robust ahead of time and save time in the future.\n\n\nStuff like that.  And just general practices.  As I'm looking towards possibly moving out of academia and into industry, I'm worried my code will look very amateur and be hard for other people to use if I end up collaborating with people and/or designing something used by someone other than myself.
