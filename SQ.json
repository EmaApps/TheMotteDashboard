I realise I'm treading philosophical old ground here but it is something I've been thinking about recently.\n\nIn the Prisoner's Dilemma, and the Tragedy of the Commons etc, we have the general case of rational individual actions leading to negative outcomes for everyone.\n\nWhat this really reminds me of egoist, classical realist, amoral (individualist, even) philosophy, perhaps best exemplified by Machiavelli's *The Prince*. That is generally a purely self interested individual with no concern for the common good. But there is a glaring issue with Machiavellian philosophy. No one would ever want to work under the Prince, over him or with him, because he would betray you in a heartbeat, and would be constantly looking for opportunities to undermine you for his own benefit. If everyone took Machiavelli's advice and acted like the perfect Prince, there could be no society. Everyone would just be continuously trying to screw each other over, there can be no true cooperation or common good.\n\nThis has kind of given me the idea of a kind of 'social parasitism' (yes I am aware of the association of the term with Soviet political prisoners - I using it in an different sense. It's an apt label here). Machiavelli's Prince is basically a 'social parasite', in the sense benefiting himself while harming society and others generally. Just like an actual biological parasite, the social parasite needs the host ('society') to thrive, yet if there are too many social parasite, it will leech too much off the host and kill society and itself (metaphorically), causing society to devolve into chaos and bloody anarchy. The Prince can only exist by exploiting the system he is ultimately undermining by his actions.\n\nIf I can think of any benefit that the Prince might provide to society, it might be if there is only one who gains supreme power and thus could theoretically rule competently (after all, this was the original intent for the Prince. But that requires there to only ever be one and only one Prince or would-be Prince. (Maybe you could use this as justification for some kind of elitism)\n\nSociopaths are essentially naturally this, amoral and a callous disregard for others, only concerned with their own benefit, abusing others trust. But too many sociopaths would cause everyone to become distrustful and thus collapsing the whole system that sociopaths love to exploit.\n\nIn some sense, I think this also applies to the constantly debated mistake vs conflict theory around here, with conflict theory obviously representing social parasitism. Conflict theorists can make easy gains by exploiting unassuming mistake theorists, but too much conflict results in dysfunction and collapse of social institutions which the conflict theorists are trying to overtake in the first place. The mistake theorists are the ones actually trying to solve issues, after all. I also wonder if there's a conflict theorist Schelling point, where the number of conflict theorists reaches critical mass, they create more problems than mistake theorists can solve, so mistake theorists are left with a choice, to either: become a conflict theorists and try to grab whatever resources are around before the collapse, or \"die\" a mistake theorist. (e.g. a previously principled scientist becoming politicized to secure his job even if it undermines the integrity and value of said job).\n\nThis is obviously not a new observation, but then moral systems (historically religions) primarily exist as enforcement mechanism, as a means to dissuade people from becoming social parasites. It's the Mafia don in the Prison's Dilemma who threatens the prisoners to keep their mouths shut.\n\nI guess another question is, does social parasitism exist in mostly stable or unstable equilibrium? Does the system tend towards a sustainable number of social parasites, only forced out of balance by extreme external events? Or is there a natural, cyclical boom-bust pattern, where increasing social parasitism will ultimately destroy institutions, and mistake theorists will have to build new institutions from scratch before the cycle repeats.\n\nMaybe I'm looking at it backwards. Maybe the conflict theorists surge *after* the collapse of an institution, rushing to pick at the scraps like a vulture collecting carrion. Attempting to carve out a little niche for themselves, while stunting the ability for mistake theorists to rebuild. Maybe this is what we are seeing with the death of God, decaying social cohesion, and the attempt to establish some new common morality again.\n\nYeah I don't really know where I'm going with this. I would like to hear everyone else's thoughts on this.", "edited": 1659290238.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iido1sq", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I want to ramble out some thoughts about behaviour game theory as it applies to society or morality, or at least that&amp;#39;s the best way I can think to describe it.

Everyone would just be continuously trying to screw each other over, there can be no true cooperation or common good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has kind of given me the idea of a kind of &amp;#39;social parasitism&amp;#39; (yes I am aware of the association of the term with Soviet political prisoners - I using it in an different sense. It&amp;#39;s an apt label here). Machiavelli&amp;#39;s Prince is basically a &amp;#39;social parasite&amp;#39;, in the sense benefiting himself while harming society and others generally. Just like an actual biological parasite, the social parasite needs the host (&amp;#39;society&amp;#39;) to thrive, yet if there are too many social parasite, it will leech too much off the host and kill society and itself (metaphorically), causing society to devolve into chaos and bloody anarchy. The Prince can only exist by exploiting the system he is ultimately undermining by his actions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I can think of any benefit that the Prince might provide to society, it might be if there is only one who gains supreme power and thus could theoretically rule competently (after all, this was the original intent for the Prince. But that requires there to only ever be one and only one Prince or would-be Prince. (Maybe you could use this as justification for some kind of elitism)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sociopaths are essentially naturally this, amoral and a callous disregard for others, only concerned with their own benefit, abusing others trust. But too many sociopaths would cause everyone to become distrustful and thus collapsing the whole system that sociopaths love to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some sense, I think this also applies to the constantly debated mistake vs conflict theory around here, with conflict theory obviously representing social parasitism. Conflict theorists can make easy gains by exploiting unassuming mistake theorists, but too much conflict results in dysfunction and collapse of social institutions which the conflict theorists are trying to overtake in the first place. The mistake theorists are the ones actually trying to solve issues, after all. I also wonder if there&amp;#39;s a conflict theorist Schelling point, where the number of conflict theorists reaches critical mass, they create more problems than mistake theorists can solve, so mistake theorists are left with a choice, to either: become a conflict theorists and try to grab whatever resources are around before the collapse, or &amp;quot;die&amp;quot; a mistake theorist. (e.g. a previously principled scientist becoming politicized to secure his job even if it undermines the integrity and value of said job).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is obviously not a new observation, but then moral systems (historically religions) primarily exist as enforcement mechanism, as a means to dissuade people from becoming social parasites. It&amp;#39;s the Mafia don in the Prison&amp;#39;s Dilemma who threatens the prisoners to keep their mouths shut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess another question is, does social parasitism exist in mostly stable or unstable equilibrium? Does the system tend towards a sustainable number of social parasites, only forced out of balance by extreme external events? Or is there a natural, cyclical boom-bust pattern, where increasing social parasitism will ultimately destroy institutions, and mistake theorists will have to build new institutions from scratch before the cycle repeats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;m looking at it backwards. Maybe the conflict theorists surge &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the collapse of an institution, rushing to pick at the scraps like a vulture collecting carrion. Attempting to carve out a little niche for themselves, while stunting the ability for mistake theorists to rebuild. Maybe this is what we are seeing with the death of God, decaying social cohesion, and the attempt to establish some new common morality again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah I don&amp;#39;t really know where I&amp;#39;m going with this. I would like to hear everyone else&amp;#39;s thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wchwo3/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_31_2022/iido1sq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1659274030.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wchwo3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_iiczkhv", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iiczkhv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Blacknsilver1", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1659256529.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wchwo3", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_2yhx9fjl", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "When looking at an url for a potentially sketchy website, which end should I be looking at- the front or the back?   \nIn other words, the     \n\n&gt;www.microsoft...    \n\nor the     \n\n&gt;...microsoft.com/    \n\n?    \n\nI'm assuming at least one end can show legitimacy at a glance.
