This has recently changed. I've grown increasingly interested about the idea of falling in love and marrying someone. There are a number of reasons for this. Lately, more and more frequently I've been feeling unhappy about being alone and lacking connections, and I like the idea of someone genuinely feeling attracted to me. I sometimes feel like my current life is pointless overall; creating a family and fathering children feels like a good way of making myself feel that I've amounted to something. And, to be honest, I want to actually share my sexuality with another living person. \n\nOn the other hand... I'm pretty introverted. Social interaction exhausts me quickly. There are days where, after having to endure others' company for many hours, I just want to spend an entire evening without hearing another person's voice. Now, I'm not *bad* at social interaction: When I need to, I'm good at talking with people, acting smooth, suave, and confident. But it tires me out fast. And, to me, it always feels like I'm putting on an act, pretending to be someone I'm not. \n\nThis makes me worry if marriage is really a good idea for me. Social interactions wears me out, but if I got married, I suppose I'd need to socially interact with my wife (and later children) all the time. Getting to be alone would become the exception rather than a daily occurrence. It might make me miserable rather than happy. \nAlso, while I'm confident that I can get a woman interested in me by charming and intelligent conversation, I'm scared of accidentally deceiving her.
