This doesn&#39;t seem quite *unbelievably* stupid, since, there is a lot of very stupid things that have already happened, so I can believe it, but...man this just seems like a really dumb thing to do.

There&#39;s no way this isn&#39;t a major step on an escalatory spiral.

&amp;gt;“Which generals?” Kelly asked.

&amp;gt;“The German generals in World War II,” Trump responded.

&amp;gt;“You do know that they tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off?” Kelly said.

Ukraine continues to do really well with HIMARS shoot and scoot, but they are feeling that 227mm, and we (the US) are laggin with the 610mm ATACMS, apparently because it can reach pretty deep into Russia and we don&#39;t want to hear about Ukraine doing a little whoopsy and atomizing a square block of Kursk or something.

The pocket from before is getting worse and more secure at the same time, with lots and lots of dudes there now (unconfirmed reports of 25000 with one unchallenged route out and in); this is scary if you are  a troop and need to eat, but also means that Ukraine can&#39;t just muscle their way in, so ???

As a woman from a south american country who migrated to a Nordic country, I had expectations about what it would be like to live in a more progressive society when it comes to gender roles. Nordic countries are well known for their advances in gender equality, with men and women playing very similar roles in parenting, the work environment, politics, and so on.

And I was not disappointed. To my experience, this is true.
