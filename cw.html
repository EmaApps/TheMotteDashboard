That said:

Igor Girkin get&#39;s arrested trying to enter the donbas illegally to fight on the front lines. While I, personally, think he is a huge piece of shit it is admirable that he will put his money where his mouth is. 

Russia reportedly  transferring some of their equivalent to training battalions to the conflict areas. This should add some spine to their infantry, and add some offensive teeth to their forces.

For those who aren&#39;t familiar, here&#39;s a rundown: Prior to WWII, most urban poor (minorities in particular) lived in overcrowded tenement housing. This was privately-owned, market-rate housing, but conditions were considered substandard at the time and are unthinkable now. A lot of the apartments lacked windows or any kind of ventilation, most units had shared bathrooms, and some still relied on outhouses (in the city) into the 1950s. A lot of the stuff that would easily fail a code inspection now was par for the course.
