How many extremists are consciously exaggerating their case to move the needle of public opinion?  
How many could be persuaded to stop if they were exposed to the actual distribution of opinions?

Lived experience is the idea that for example a black person’s experience trumps any data a white person collects because living as a black person provides more info compared to any data a white person could analyze. 

But a person “born” a male who appears a male and lives life as a male cannot have any experience as a woman; that is, just like the white person can’t really know what it’s like to be a black person a male cant really know what it is like or means to be a female. 

So how can the male know he is a female if he can’t understand what a female is due to a lack of lived experience?...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/Lizzardspawn">u/Lizzardspawn</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igd5kzu/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-16 06:33:10 UTC">Jul 16, 06:33 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igd5kzu/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">In abortion debate I see that number of elective abortions that a woman could ha</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igd5kzu/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">ve during her lifetime is somehow left out of the discourse.

- Distinguish between *sex* and *gender*. 
  - Sex is a biological fact. Gender is primarily a feeling and is more malleable.

&amp;gt;Part of the issue here is that Democrats have consistently chosen to interpret the fact that Trump is a scumbag as indicating that Trump is an ideological extremist, when these are just different questions. But I think in some ways the bigger and more unconsidered issues have to do with how the 2016 primaries played out. In particular, Clinton got spooked by Bernie Sanders’ stronger-than-expected early showing and decided to respond by outflanking him to the left on social issues. I believe that this backfired and caused Sanders to do better with moderate Democrats than he otherwise would have done and also bolstered his popularity with the ...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/SaxifragetheGreen">u/SaxifragetheGreen</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1ycv6/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-13 22:45:46 UTC">Jul 13, 22:45 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1ycv6/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">[The Case Against Judicial Review](https://prospect.org/justice/the-case-against</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1ycv6/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">-judicial-review)

Judicial review, first implemented in Marbury v Madison, is the basis of the powers traditionally held by the Supreme Court. This article goes over the history of it, but I can&#39;t get over the slant. It reads like nothing more nor less than sour grapes. Judicial review is bad because it is leading to bad outcomes today, right now. Starting from the end of the article:

&amp;gt;Under any government, there is always a danger of its power being abused. Democratically elected legislatures are not immune from this problem.

I think people inherently don&#39;t like being told what to do. When someone compels you to do something, chances are it benefits them more than it benefits you, so we have an automatic reflex to assume that we&#39;re being shortchanged.

The weird thing is, when you look around at modern society, there&#39;s no one entity that really tells you what to do. If you don&#39;t like your job, you can quit at any time and no one will make you keep working.
