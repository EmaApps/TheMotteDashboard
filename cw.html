I&#39;m gonna try and figure out where we are with WikiLeaks.

Wikileaks has come from the perspective that information wants to be free, that leaks hold people accountable, and that releasing all available data is the best way to do so.

I think that this came from the same place of Aaron Schwartz, Jimbo Whales techno-utopian anti-state idealism that was in the air around the mid to late aughts. Compare the [Declaration Of Independence Of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence).

We now live in that world, where it&#39;s easy to disseminate vast dumps of data. It&#39;s available to anyone.
