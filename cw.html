&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;In fact, if we compare America and Britain, as we do below, then we see that despite the two countries having entirely different histories of racism and discrimination, the trends now closely track one another.

The great thing about San Antonio is it is essentially a foreign city in America. You will probably hear more Spanish than English there. It&#39;s basically a Mexican city in America.
