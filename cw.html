So minor spoilers for Stranger Things, on the character side.  Not the plot side.  They made Will unambiguously gay in season 4.  I hate it.  I hate everything about it.

I remember when Stranger Things came out, a lot of us 80&#39;s kids loved it.  It felt relatively authentic to our childhoods, especially being a nerd back then.  A group of us loved it so much, we got together for a retro AD&amp;amp;D 2E campaign.

The biking around everywhere.  The relatively undeveloped spread out suburban/rural town.  The total lack of adult supervision.  And of course, being a nerd super into something that utterly consumes your every waking thought.

This essay will be largely familiar to all who read my thoughts on student loans in the culture war thread [two years ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/jv161w/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_november_16/gckh5ca/?context=999). Given the current salience of the issue, I thought I should revisit and expand the essay to account for the actual loan cancellation announcement. Partially excerpted below, with a focus on sections not included in my original post:

I maintained, as I was taught at the time, that just because someone acts that way, it has no bearing on their sexual orientation. They could be effeminate, but still like women.

When the war began, I was afraid American support would soon disappear, come any newsworthy crisis. But it&#39;s been 6 months and support seems as strong as ever, at least judging by the recent 3bn military transfer along with the number of blue-and-yellow emojis on twitter. For many reasons, I think this war is not only a great chance to beat back Russian expansionism, but also to bring Ukraine closer to the west, hence why this question is important for me.

So--why do Americans seem so eager to help Ukraine?

My take is that it&#39;s mainly because they&#39;re acting out values that we admire.

And yet that’s been almost entirely forgotten in the years since. Trump’s presidency was a resounding failure on the anti-immigration front, so maybe that’s why. 

But for whatever reason, today immigration has fallen almost completely by the wayside compared to 2016. On both sides.

&amp;gt;At least 9 million borrowers could have their balances entirely cleared by Biden’s plan, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

&amp;gt;Biden’s decision to move ahead with $10,000 in student debt cancellation for borrowers who earn under $125,000 will cost the federal government around $244 billion, Kantrowitz estimated. The $20,000 in relief for Pell Grant recipients may add around another $1...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/DevonAndChris">u/DevonAndChris</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilm1fkk/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-24 16:23:19 UTC">Aug 24, 16:23 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilm1fkk/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">

The whole thing is good but I want to highlight this paragraph and footnote:

&amp;gt; To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the features of a religion. In particular it must have **strict and arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their purity by obeying**, and its adherents must believe that **anyone who obeys these rules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn&#39;t**. 

&amp;gt; The superficial demands of orthodoxy make it an inexpensive substitute for virtue. And that in turn is **one of the reasons orthodoxy is so attractive to bad people.

A primer for the case is [here](https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/2022/08/litigation-highlight-antonyuk-v-bruen/).

What are non-Trumpists supposed to do about the fact that the former President continues to push The Lie? Given that the idea that the election was stolen is both false and obviously false - which, let us be clear, both of those claims are clearly the case - what are those of us who can observe and accept reality supposed to do about the large portion of the population who can or will not? The ones who either have actually been fooled and genuinely believe The Lie, or else who are simply lying to themselves when they say they think that Trump genuinely won the election?

[This article](https://www.aier.org/article/goodbye-anthony-fauci/) captured a bit of what I dislike about him. A career bureaucrat most of his life. His handling of the AIDS crisis was unimpressive, and his handling of covid felt downright criminal.

I do hope there is some kind of come-uppance for this whole thing. Even if the only consequence he suffers is a public shaming, I&#39;d rather have that than just have him quietly get ignored. I doubt any of that will happen.

I think abortion is a similar issue because, like &quot;equality,&quot; people on &quot;both sides of the issue&quot; today share much more common ground than they think, and are thoroughly blinkered as a result. 

The “anti-abortion” side is pretty straightforward, at least ostensibly. “Human life is sacred, fetus is human life, therefore no kill.” 

The “pro-abortion” side cannot dispute the idea that human life qua human life, that is, individual members of the biological species *homo sapiens*, is sacred and inherently worthy protecting.

Yet the interests of the wealthy have bought the ears of our elected officials. The cost seems very very minimal too, maybe just a couple million a year of campaign contributions to a handful of pivotal senators to save tens of billions in taxes over time.
