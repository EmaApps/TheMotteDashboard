This story has always held my attention, and I must admit to a certain amount of wistful fascination with the entire episode. The story of a nobody who does something extraordinary, even though it meant his death. There&#39;s something glorious about it.

As a woman from a south american country who migrated to a Nordic country, I had expectations about what it would be like to live in a more progressive society when it comes to gender roles. Nordic countries are well known for their advances in gender equality, with men and women playing very similar roles in parenting, the work environment, politics, and so on.

And I was not disappointed. To my experience, this is true.
