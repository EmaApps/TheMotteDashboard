This is flawed reasoning. There is one respect in which we know with certainty that fathers are generally ~~worse~~ better than their children: the quality of their genes. The average person has more deleterious genetic variants than his parents.

TL;DR: We need to stop using extremist language and start defining our terms.

From u/buttfaceszn:

The first is the [Women&#39;s Health Protection Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3755/text). This bill basically sets out a list of reasons why abortions may not be restricted and creates a test for what future reasons will be prohibited by the law. It targets pretty directly laws various Republican states passed when *Roe* was still in effect to limit abortion. It empowers both the US Attorney General and private parties (including those seeking abortions and those providing them) to sue to enforce the law.

[Betting markets](https://electionbettingodds.com/NextUKConservativeLeader2022.html) give Liz Truss a 47% chance of winning and Penny Mordaunt an 12% chance.

Dominic Cummings (rationalist, Brexit Mastermind, and former top adviser to Boris Johnson) [writes](https://dominiccummings.substack.com/p/snippets-6-the-leadership-race-sw1?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email):

&amp;gt; PennyM is a true idiot. She would be total fiasco as PM

&amp;gt; LizzT is a bit less stupid but much more crackers and would also be a total fiasco.

&amp;gt; Either of them would not just fail, they could destroy the party. Which means that many will be cheering for one of them.

I don’t really like when people use the term incel as an insult to people who bring up redpill/PUA/manosphere-type things, since I suspect there’s a lot of non-incels who find these things interesting and I personally think some of it has value. But from the perspective of someone who is trying to insult a redpill/MRA type in a heated Reddit argument, it at least makes sense to call them an incel. Incels afaik do really tend to be into these ideas, and people who excessively harp on them can come across as resentful about their own personal struggles with women.

I think finally we may be seeing our fist notable, multinational woke undoing. It&#39;s too early to blame wokness for sure, but Disney stock has been doing horribly lately, way worse than the S&amp;amp;P 500. 

Disney is at $95, a 53% decline from its peak just 16 months ago, versus a 20% decline for the S&amp;amp;P 500. Moreover, Disney stock is unchanged since early 2015, lagging the S&amp;amp;P 500 considerably there too. 

This difference is huge:  over the past 5 years the S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 56% (excluding dividends) but Disney is down 11%
