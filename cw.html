When the war began, I was afraid American support would soon disappear, come any newsworthy crisis. But it&#39;s been 6 months and support seems as strong as ever, at least judging by the recent 3bn military transfer along with the number of blue-and-yellow emojis on twitter. For many reasons, I think this war is not only a great chance to beat back Russian expansionism, but also to bring Ukraine closer to the west, hence why this question is important for me.

So--why do Americans seem so eager to help Ukraine?

My take is that it&#39;s mainly because they&#39;re acting out values that we admire.

And yet that’s been almost entirely forgotten in the years since. Trump’s presidency was a resounding failure on the anti-immigration front, so maybe that’s why. 

But for whatever reason, today immigration has fallen almost completely by the wayside compared to 2016. On both sides.

Given that the idea that the election was stolen is both false and obviously false - which, let us be clear, both of those claims are clearly the case - what are those of us who can observe and accept reality supposed to do about the large portion of the population who can or will not? The ones who either have actually been fooled and genuinely believe The Lie, or else who are simply lying to themselves when they say they think that Trump genuinely won the election?

The “anti-abortion” side is pretty straightforward, at least ostensibly. “Human life is sacred, fetus is human life, therefore no kill.” 

The “pro-abortion” side cannot dispute the idea that human life qua human life, that is, individual members of the biological species *homo sapiens*, is sacred and inherently worthy protecting.

Not sure this is totally culture war, except for the fact that nuclear power itself has been such a wretched target of environmentalist culture warriors that we haven&#39;t bothered to build any nuke plants in the USA in decades.

The article does the math to figure out how much power is generated by uranium and coal, and calculates an equivalent amount of pollutant for honest comparisons. Really pretty simple. Conclusion is that two nuclear fuel assemblies of uranium, each of which are about a half a meter long and ten centimeters wide, produce the same amount of energy as enough coal to fill up (with CO2) every hot...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/jspsfx">u/jspsfx</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilbllbf/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-22 13:57:32 UTC">Aug 22, 13:57 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilbllbf/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Anyone else here trawl through chaotic, conspiracy/politically incorrect forums </a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilbllbf/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">looking for interesting nuggets of information?
