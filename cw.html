- Reinhart was working for the justice department
- 10/07 Reinhart registers a llc registered in Epstein’s defense lawyers name(not sure if it was registered like this from the beginning or switched later)
- during the middle of the case Reinhart switches sides, quits the DOJ and immediately starts represents Epstein’s employees. The llc is used for his defense firm
- 2011 Reinhart denies he was involved in the case while at the DOJ during a lawsuit 
- 2013 supervisors of reinhart contradict him and say he was privy to private info about the case.

At least one tip to the police was from a redditor in the Albuquerque subreddit who methodically searched Google Streetview for the suspect’s Jetta, which had small but significant damage in one place.

The killer targeted local Muslim men, mostly Shia but one Sunni. He lay in wait for his victims, hinting that he knew them personally. The community was devastated by the deaths and was also devastated by the killer’s identity: a Sunni gentleman who was known to be a bit off his rocker, and seems to have been motivated by his son marrying a Shiite girl.

It&#39;s hard to get psyched up about GOP governors going after CRT or cracking down on left-wing corporations, and it&#39;s hard to see it as anything more than a rear-guard action. As long as the left controls the narrative, which they will continue to do since they control media, movies, social media, etc. Hard power can&#39;t prevail against soft-power in the long-term. Seems like the only way the right could get anything like a lasting victory would be to somehow seize control of cultural institutions, but that is a far more difficult thing to do than to seize control of stage legislatures or governors&#39; mansions....</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/grendel-khan">u/grendel-khan</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijmqb7h/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-09 20:54:46 UTC">Aug 09, 20:54 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijmqb7h/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Jordan Weissmann for *Slate*, [&quot;Why Internet Leftists Are So Pissed About Democr</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijmqb7h/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">ats’ Historic Climate Bill&quot;](https://slate.com/business/2022/08/inflation-reduction-act-climate-change-criticism-adam-mckay-david-sirota.html).
