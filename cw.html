Why, you ask, in light of all the talk about sorting meritocracy and the like elsewhere in the thread? Because it makes elections and government possible. Obviously that has its ups and downs, but as we&#39;ve seen so far, governmental transitions aren&#39;t usually punctuated by revolutions.

I posit that this is only possible when you take &quot;all men are created equal&quot; (before the law) as an axiom.

When you examine how much is needed to create a truly sympathetic account of something today — the domination of a social environment to trap an audience, writers and designers, publications, media, attractive spokesmen, storytellers — it reads like a veritable army. All of these “soldiers” work together to create a sympathetic portrayal of an event in the hopes of influencing opinion. If you can raise an influencer army, are you really weak?
