Judicial review, first implemented in Marbury v Madison, is the basis of the powers traditionally held by the Supreme Court. This article goes over the history of it, but I can&#39;t get over the slant. It reads like nothing more nor less than sour grapes. Judicial review is bad because it is leading to bad outcomes today, right now. Starting from the end of the article:

&amp;gt;Under any government, there is always a danger of its power being abused. Democratically elected legislatures are not immune from this problem.

I think people inherently don&#39;t like being told what to do. When someone compels you to do something, chances are it benefits them more than it benefits you, so we have an automatic reflex to assume that we&#39;re being shortchanged.

The weird thing is, when you look around at modern society, there&#39;s no one entity that really tells you what to do. If you don&#39;t like your job, you can quit at any time and no one will make you keep working.

**Economic Policy**

&amp;gt;But most important of all was the shift in the economic role of women. Before Abe, Japan had persistently lagged in terms of women’s labor force participation, especially among mothers. The country’s sexism was legendary and entrenched. When Abe came to power at the end of 2012, I definitely did not expect him to change this — during his brief, abortive first tenure as PM, his health minister caused a national scandal by referring to women as “birth-giving machines”. Abe’s reputation as a staunch cultural conservative seemed to presage more business-as-usual.  
But it was not business-as-usual.

Objectives

&amp;gt; 1. In the aspect of attitude to the truth: the acquisition of reliable knowledge of the most important cultural, political, social and economic changes in Poland and the world after 1945 up to the present - and in this context obtaining an understanding of the main issues of social life, politics and law, as well as knowledge of the immediate origins and nature of the great problems of the modern world.

The left and the right have both recently used this slogan,</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifqh42h/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500"> and interestingly enough, have argued their points in almost exactly the same way down four levels of argument.

**Abortion**

- Left: When it comes to abortion, my body my choice. The government must respect my bodily autonomy and my right to make choices about my own body.
- Right: But it’s not just about your body. There is a child developing inside of you who also has rights, and the government must respect their bodily autonomy too.
- Left: It&#39;s not a real child, it doesn’t substantially have the ability to experience or think. Even ignoring my right to privacy, I have the right to avoid a life-changing nine month pregnancy which could see me dead or disabled because of it, and I would...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/Walterodim79">u/Walterodim79</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifpphsh/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-11 12:20:02 UTC">Jul 11, 12:20 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifpphsh/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">We talked quite a bit about the quality of information in the media ecosystem an</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifpphsh/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">d how that has intersected with science of questionable quality in the Covid universe, but today I want to highlight an example that&#39;s generally a bit further from the culture war. Over the weekend, my NYT digest pinged me with the now one year old wellness article *[Do We Really Need to Take 10,000 Steps a Day for Our Health?](https://archive.ph/Xq0Fv#selection-319.0-322.0)*. As someone that&#39;s immediately triggered by people looking for excuses to justify their sedentary lifestyles, I naturally clicked through for a quick rage-read (put aside for a moment how unhealthy *that* behavior is). So, what&#39;s the origin of the claim that fewer steps is actually fine?
