I came across a [news story](https://www.khou.com/article/news/crime/tomball-is</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v0trau/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_may_30_2022/ib5guzz/" class="text-gray-500">d-family-killed-in-centerville-texas/285-ad1274ed-db15-4c2e-b2d0-54948156479c) that made me more upset than usual. An escaped convict, a cartel member, murdered five members of a family in Texas. Reasoning why this story hit me hard, I concluded that the crime I find significant is not the crime that is measured in graphs and figures. I think we’re measuring crime incorrectly and should be fighting crime differently. 

In terms of the betterment of society, a criminal killing a well-adjusted citizen is worse than a criminal killing another criminal. Much crime in America is criminal-on-criminal. This should be modified a bit, because criminality is a spectrum, not a matter of violating the l...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/Doglatine">u/Doglatine</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v0trau/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_may_30_2022/ib3mvbv/"><span title="2022-06-04 00:59:45 UTC">Jun 04, 00:59 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v0trau/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_may_30_2022/ib3mvbv/" class="extlink">**Some quick thoughts on value change**

This evening I sent out invites to my birthday party to a bunch of friends. One of my friends (the wife of a barrister pal) asked me if we were enjoying the jubilee. I commented that my wife (from the Philippines) had eaten a bunch of scones already, to which my friend&#39;s wife replied &quot;oh, she&#39;s gone native!&quot;

At this point, my cheeks flushed a little. Why? After all, this was a wholly innocuous comment, and was in no way indicative of any colonialist feelings on the part of my friend&#39;s wife. It was entirely a matter of using a figure of speech in its appropriate context.

Thus, much research regarding nature vs nurture mistakenly concludes environmental factors (or even specific types of factors) as the cause of whatever correlations are observed, without considering the alternative hypothesis (inheritance).

To me, that such an elementary mistake is so common is sufficient to render the entire field suspect. Still, I think the issues studied are incredibly important, and I&#39;m curious about how much of the &#39;commonly accepted wisdom&#39; regarding nurture can actually be trusted.

After gay marriage was legalized in the States, in the mid 2010s, all the progressive machinery needed a new cause to champion or the money, and purpose, dried up and they found a replacement for gays with transgenders and moved all the cultural infrastructure accordingly.

A young christian woman was lynched by muslim students at the college she went to, supposedly right before she was about to be taken into police protection. There are conflicting reports on what she was killed for, but it seems to be a social media post of some kind. In response, the Nigerian government has declared that the college she attended will be closed.

According to this article there are dozens of lawyers rushing to defend the men accused of murdering her.

This was then confirmed as a Swedish (and, to some degree, a general Nordic) custom by other posters. Much bewilderment and condemnation of the Swedish culture as a child-starving horror show has followed, by other Europeans as well as non-Europeans.

At the center of the shooting, like others before it, was a false conviction that an international Jewish conspiracy intends to supplant white voters with immigrants who will gradually take over political power in America.

The conspiracy, known as the “great replacement theory,” has roots reaching back at least to the czarist Russian antisemitic hoax called “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” which purported to be a Jewish plot to overtake Christianity in Europe.

I have some unique insight, as I’ve spent the last four years traveling full-time with my family of six, essentially as a family of digital nomads. I&#39;ve had the chance to experience everything from giant cities to tiny rural towns, and just about everything in between. I’ve lived in both the United States and Europe, and  I’ve spent a decent amount of time in each place we’ve experienced - meaning a month or more, beyond just living as a tourist for a week. We’ve had to buy groceries, do laundry, and get around using either a car or public transportation, just like we would if we lived there permanently.

I&#39;m wondering if the implication is that trans people have feelings of disassociation, and getting hormone injections help them feel better about that, simply because hormones help anyone have less feelings of disassociation.

First, about monkeypox. Monkeypox is a poxvirus (same family as smallpox, chickenpox) which is known to be transmissible by contact with bodily fluids and by contact with contaminated fabrics. The memorandum sent by my institution says that it is *suspected* to be transmissible by droplets. In this context, droplets are airborne particles larger than aerosols.

But there&#39;s an absent actor in the definition, who was the one who cheated them, who took advantage of their gullibility?
