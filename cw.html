Russia is hauling out the museum piece 152&#39;s from the 1920&#39;s for second line units; the tempo of their advance and quantity/quality of artillery fire has dropped off way quicker (Like, an order of magnitude quicker) than I thought it would.

Apparently, the HIMARS shoot and scoot has been working. Ukraine can&#39;t push Russia where they are strong; but Russia can&#39;t advance along an entire front anymore without taking unsafe risks.

Per the details on my YouTube page, in Part 1 we touch on the deracinated dating pov of the isolated, profilicity (ala philosopher Hans-Georg Moeller), AWALT (&quot;All Women Are Like That&quot;), MGTOW, the all-that-matters-are-looks blackpilled MRAs, and hilarious old school pickup artist &quot;Mystery.&quot;

In Part 2 we discuss the racial composition of incels; &quot;Just Be White&quot;; the relationship between income, job type and infidelity; and the impact of remote work and pandemic on singles vs. marrieds.

To something more like:

&amp;gt;The genderqueer community is comprised of people who have gender identities, which may involve wearing clothing of their preferred gender... A small minority of them express a desire to become, or already see themselves as, their gender

However, these are two that were already very unpopular, and remain very unpopular, just slightly less, so it may represent changes only within the segment of the population that is very pro trans rights becoming even more pro.
