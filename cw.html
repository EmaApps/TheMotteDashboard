I recently read a post that was about one subject, mentioned something else as a point of comparison, and resulted in a conversation that was dominated by the metaphorical comparison rather than the subject level issue.

The entire point of metaphors is comparison of two very different things that have certain similarities. In the case of contention, what those similarities are is also likely to come under contention. Many of the metaphors on here turn into argument over the technicalities of the metaphor rather than the object-level issue. 

That has a lot to do with the type of audience you get here, but it still illustrates that metaphors themselves can conceal as much as they reve...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/Lurking_Chronicler_2">u/Lurking_Chronicler_2</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imo2yki/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-09-01 15:09:54 UTC">Sep 01, 15:09 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imo2yki/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">/u/Ilforte any thoughts on Ravil Maganov‘s death?

An airplane&#39;s wings are for flying - the intentions of engineers ensure that. But birds had no creator, no agent involved in their existence. We might be able to metaphorically talk about a bird being &quot;designed&quot; or &quot;built&quot; for flight, but it is only that: a metaphor.

The game was overshadowed by allegations of ugly racism when Duke&#39;s black starter, Rachel Richardson (I think there are several black women on the team, but only she is a starter) said that she heard someone racially abuse her throughout the match.  The player&#39;s ~~grandmother~~ godmother also took to twitter to say that the player was called the n-word &quot;every time she served&quot;.

This story hit the national papers with the predictable headlines - strong denunciation against racism, praise for Rachel as a strong person standing up to adversity, denunciation of coaches and officials, athleticndepartments, the crowd at the game, and all Mormons.

I&#39;m gonna try and figure out where we are with WikiLeaks.

Wikileaks has come from the perspective that information wants to be free, that leaks hold people accountable, and that releasing all available data is the best way to do so.

I think that this came from the same place of Aaron Schwartz, Jimbo Whales techno-utopian anti-state idealism that was in the air around the mid to late aughts. Compare the [Declaration Of Independence Of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence).

We now live in that world, where it&#39;s easy to disseminate vast dumps of data. It&#39;s available to anyone.

&quot;Christianity is a cringe cuck Asiatic soy religion&quot; 

&quot;Actually Christianity is heckin based and redpilled and built western civilization.&quot; 

I disagree with the proposition, or at least, I am pretty sure I do.
