The entire point of metaphors is comparison of two very different things that have certain similarities. In the case of contention, what those similarities are is also likely to come under contention. Many of the metaphors on here turn into argument over the technicalities of the metaphor rather than the object-level issue.

Finland is getting hit less than Central Europe, but getting hit nevertheless. We haven&#39;t been \*quite\* as dependent on Russian power than many other countries - Russian gas was only 5 % of the energy supply, Russians cut the flow already back in May, and in general Russian electricity imports have formed 10 % of the Finnish electricity use. However, prices are still expected to rise very high in the winter, naturally the season when the society most needs electricity and has to import it.

The crisis is particularly - as everywhere else - hitting those living in detached housing.

But in effect, it looks like they&#39;re taking out their frustrations on random nobodies. One of those guys was Hervis Rogers, who went viral during the 2020 election for waiting in line at a polling place for six hours and being the last person to vote. He eagerly spoke to and gave his name to a TV news crew that was on site, presumably proud to showcase to the public how committed he was to voting.

The game was overshadowed by allegations of ugly racism when Duke&#39;s black starter, Rachel Richardson (I think there are several black women on the team, but only she is a starter) said that she heard someone racially abuse her throughout the match.  The player&#39;s ~~grandmother~~ godmother also took to twitter to say that the player was called the n-word &quot;every time she served&quot;.

This story hit the national papers with the predictable headlines - strong denunciation against racism, praise for Rachel as a strong person standing up to adversity, denunciation of coaches and officials, athleticndepartments, the crowd at the game, and all Mormons.

I&#39;m gonna try and figure out where we are with WikiLeaks.

Wikileaks has come from the perspective that information wants to be free, that leaks hold people accountable, and that releasing all available data is the best way to do so.

I think that this came from the same place of Aaron Schwartz, Jimbo Whales techno-utopian anti-state idealism that was in the air around the mid to late aughts. Compare the [Declaration Of Independence Of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence).

We now live in that world, where it&#39;s easy to disseminate vast dumps of data. It&#39;s available to anyone.
