I feel like there&#39;s a lot to unpack here.  Fetterman is going to fight Washington?  Where his party has the White House, the House and the Senate???

In that vein, I ran across an [interesting article](https://mattgoodwin.substack.com/p/the-great-awokening-of-british-media) about the correlation of US and UK journalists in this process.

&amp;gt;it becomes clear that Britain’s media —once known for being much less moralistic and divisive than its American counterpart— is now undergoing the same Great Awokening.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;In fact, if we compare America and Britain, as we do below, then we see that despite the two countries having entirely different histories of racism and discrimination, the trends now closely track one another.

[Part 1](https://youtu.be/frw7mi-reRA). [Part 2](https://youtu.be/JcDBxBaEPEQ).

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Per the details on my YouTube page, in Part 1 we touch on the deracinated dating pov of the isolated, profilicity (ala philosopher Hans-Georg Moeller), AWALT (&quot;All Women Are Like That&quot;), MGTOW, the all-that-matters-are-looks blackpilled MRAs, and hilarious old school pickup artist &quot;Mystery.&quot;

&amp;amp;#x200B;

In Part 2 we discuss the racial composition of incels; &quot;Just Be White&quot;; the relationship between income, job type and infidelity; and the impact of remote work and pandemic on singles vs. marrieds.

&amp;gt;Everyone has a gender identity, but most people are [cis by default](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/01/28/cis-by-default/)

To something more like:

&amp;gt;The genderqueer community is comprised of people who have gender identities, which may involve wearing clothing of their preferred gender... A small minority of them express a desire to become, or already see themselves as, their gender

Since I&#39;ve just committed analogy in the first degree, I expect the low-decouplers to be out in full force, so here are a few objections I foresee:
