Everyone has to form a couple, and the producers add and subtract people as they go, with new people having to find a partner and the odd-men-out getting booted (or sometimes getting booted by contestant/public votes). The last couple left wins the cash prize. So everyone is always trying to either strengthen the relationship they have, or seek out a new one if they don't think the current one is going anywhere.\n\nFor whatever reason, on this particular season of Love Island, there was very little love. Connections were not made by the majority of contestants, and by halfway through it was obvious who would win because there were only like two couples and the girls had formed this weird culture of rejecting every new guy that came in. But what was still interesting was the way the process impacted the contestants. One after another, you had these jacked and tan Aussie gigachads coming into the Villa full of piss and vinegar and confidence, dead certain they would get any girl they wanted, probably because that's their experience in the real world. You had [tall jacked techno DJs](https://loveisland.fandom.com/wiki/John_James_Parton), [literal Harley riding male strippers](https://loveisland.fandom.com/wiki/Jaxon_Human), and [mutiple](https://loveisland.fandom.com/wiki/Elias_Chigros) [Male Models](https://loveisland.fandom.com/wiki/Justin_Lacko).

You could watch as their approaches went from \"Hey babe, want to oil my muscles\" to fawning and overeager, and listen to the girls talk about how the desperation was a turnoff.\n\nI feel like there's a valuable lesson for single men trying to figure out dating somewhere in there. Something like, confidence is situational, and nothing will provide you with objective confidence in all situations, you just need to maintain your self-worth and play your part. Josh, who ultimately finished third despite not getting any romantic connections until late in the season, stayed within himself and adapted to his part, so when a new girl came in he didn't fuck it up.
