If one times one equals one that means that two is of no value because one times itself has no effect. One times one equals two because the square root of four is two, so what's the square root of two? Should be one, but we're told it's two, and that cannot be.\n\nApparently he had such a problem with the regular math being taught there that he dropped out of college. I don't know how much work into Terryology he's done, but he's talked about spending time constructing (physical plastic) models to prove his new \"math\" and once [Tweeted a \"proof\" of why one times one cannot equal one](https://twitter.com/terrencehoward/status/925754491881877507) in an apparent bid to appease his critics.
