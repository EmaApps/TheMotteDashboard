The game is wildly influential, often considered one of the best games of all time\u2026and has aged like moderately fine vinegar. If you weren\u2019t active in gaming at the time it\u2019s hard to overstate the influence of the game. It was fantastic, for many people it changed what they thought games were capable of, and one of the spoilers was for decades afterwards (although less so now) was often uttered along with \u201cVader, father\u201d as one of the top spoilers of all time.\n\nA big part of the game was the music. Nobuo Uematsu and the rest of the sound team had been doing fantastic work with severe technical limitations for ten years at that point, and some of the music from this era transcends videogaming to become some of the best music period (I\u2019d argue Chrono Trigger for this one). Uematsu loved progressive rock, and while he was excellent at classical compositions he loved to inject a flavor that was rare at the time into his music. Compare Dragon Quest with the average Final Fantasy battle theme. \n\nThe music of FF 7 was fantastic. \u201cOne Winged Angel\u201d (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce7gVYs7Em0) is still considered one of if not the best compositions in gaming. \u201cBombing Mission\u201d (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCcSmvGrGx8) can be unironically (and has been) performed by a massive orchestra. \n\nExcellent battle tracks have always been a tradition in JRPGs, since you\u2019ll be hearing a lot of them, and in the old days you had to stretch one track for almost all the fights in the game.\n\nThe battle track for FF 7 is \u201cTatakau Monotachi\u201d (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DotavimguEU). Limitations in fan translation resources and official releases resulted in this being generally translated (literally) as \u201cThose Who Fight\u201d if you wanted to pirate a MIDI and listen to it on a Walkman or something like that. Sometimes it would be translated as \u201cFighting\u201d and later, official releases would land on \u201cLet the Battles Begin!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fine. Not the best FF has done, but it wouldn\u2019t get that stale for most people. Most encounters are short anyway.\n\nNot so for boss battles. The boss battle theme needs to be a banger, especially in a game that mostly uses one theme for all the bosses.\n\nAND IT FUCKING IS.  \n\n\u201cSara ni Tatakau Monotachi\u201d (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_GUWdkJQgw) is still excellent, if limited by the technology of the time. Translated literally as \u201cThose Who Fight Further\u201d and occasionally as \u201cStill More Fighting\u201d the song often appears in top FF battle music lists. Later official translations would label it \u201cFight On!\u201d which I think is a shame since it loses the character of the initial battle/boss battle names. Listening to it now you can tell that something great is hidden in this track limited by technology.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll get there.\n\nIn the years since the initial release FF 7 has remained influential. The music has been remixed thousands of times, it\u2019s been a fixture in orchestral video game concerts, and Nobuo even made a metal band that plays some of these songs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzFh9GuE0rA). Gamers have been clamoring for a remake of the game. In 2020 they got it.\n\nThe game is controversial for reasons we won\u2019t get into, but the music is not. With a massive team including the original composer they made a truly next gen sound track for a next gen game. Fans had some trepidation, these songs had been remixed by the community, professional composers, and the man himself tons of times. What were they going to do?\n\nWell the answer was use everything learned about these songs and game composition over the last 20+ years. The soundtrack is absurdly good. From modern takes like an atmospheric exploration theme that turns into a battle theme when a fight starts (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5S49M40hv4) , to taking a one note joke enemy and turning it into an absurd and energetic boss battle (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgXZ2HDiCQ). The game has everything.\n\nThe original battle theme still lives all over the game (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu-dHQxxv4w), with variations to fit the mood and location of interest. But they hold back on the boss battle music. Yeah it shows up at the end of the first chapter (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdGOnPsE-Xs). And it\u2019s good. But is this it? Is this the epic remix?\n\nNo.\n\nAt the end of chapter 7 you fight a boss that was pretty much a joke in the original game. The fight is epic. And this fucking plays (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDLBKpbXQU). It has everything. I challenge you to drive the speed limit with this on. They held back, made you think they pretty whiffed on the remix for the boss theme, but they fucking stuck the landing. \n\nThe rest of the soundtrack has some damn good tracks, but nothing injected nostalgia directly into my veins like The Airbuster. \n\nNever forget how powerful music can be.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk.\n\nDW out. \n\nAnyone who has anything they want to add or correct is welcome!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ii5i4vr", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready for a deep dive into something completely random?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay: Those Who Fight Further&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1997 a little game came out called \u201cFinal Fantasy 7.\u201d You may have heard of it.
