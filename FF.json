He may have used one of my requested questions, but I can\u2019t tell as they were vague. Magnus is the most interesting case study of performance psychology because he\u2019s so beyond his competition, in what amounts to the most competitive cognitive game in the world. \n\nSome interesting bits from the interview:\n\n* Magnus does not like practicing with puzzles. Neither does he consider himself good at stand-alone puzzles. \n\n* Magnus hates strict, organized practice. He refused to do this as a child and instead enjoyed exploring interesting parts from books he takes a liking to. When he was younger he \u201cfired\u201d Kasparov as a coach (one of the best players of all time) because Kasparov wanted Magnus to analyze his past mistakes, which he found annoying.\n\n* The above two bits are shocking as it flies in the face of our understanding of deliberate practice. But actually, maybe not! While it\u2019s true that puzzles can be construed as very specific deliberate practice, you come across the scenarios in games anyway, in their \u201cnatural habitat\u201d surrounded by other information; so playing difficult games is probably better than specialized puzzles. \n\n* While focusing on past major mistakes could be seen as optimal deliberate practice, it\u2019s also highly demotivating. Magnus\u2019 practice is odd in that he appears to choose the most motivating path. He reads from books guided by pleasure, and he ignores strict puzzle-based practices. He favors playing games, and if you notice, he very often plays these games with variable strategy in mind. Instead of focusing on one opening, when he plays online he frequently changes openings, tests out things he doesn\u2019t know will work, etc. This is excellent deliberate, variable practice while maintaining motivation.\n\n* While Magnus was the poster child of athletic chess players, in recent years he has fallen out of shape. I find it interesting that he favors sports games over weightlifting or cardio. This has a motivational component, because when he\u2019s playing tennis for an hour or two he\u2019s in a state of competition. I think this extra \u201ccompetitiveness practice\u201d aids him in chess. \n\nSo I find it interesting that Magnus\u2019 approach to chess prioritizes competition and motivation. I also find it interesting to think that if Magnus were placed in chess school with dry exercises and exams, he probably wouldn\u2019t even make it in the top 200 students. He has a strong aversion to boring practice and is chiefly motivated by real competitive wins, and he\u2019s not good at chess \u201cpractice puzzles\u201d.

One daughter has muscular dystrophy, her sister is a judge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking of other examples in my life. Twins on my little league team, one batted third and one batted ninth.
