Another year of living in the boonies, then I get to move to a better spot for clinicals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im trying to minimize my exposure to video games, as I get sucked in and lose days of my life. Thanks Stellaris. I\u2019m training for a cycling race, trying to read a book a week, and have a part-time research gig to keep me busy. Dating is the one big complaint, and while the local scene sucks, I\u2019m going to try and get out to social settings more often this summer, more for the practice than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/v2a9l4/wellness_wednesday_for_june_01_2022/iasz8wc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1654101848.0, "author_flair_text": "Emotional Infinities", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_v2a9l4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_iaspmn8", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iaspmn8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "diatribe_lives", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1654097799.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_v2a9l4", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_kq4cdm23", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Looking into buying a townhouse built by DR Horton.
