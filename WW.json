Luckily my girlfriend is pretty open-minded, but (at least among the friends I&amp;#39;ve made, mostly professionals in the Bay Area) it seems hard to find social spaces that are open to discussion to contentious topics without them devolving into insults or attribution of bad motives to someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or am I just being overly neurotic here? Maybe I should have just stated something actually controversial instead of hoping someone else would, since I brought it up in the first place?
