I&amp;#39;m still kind of doing some work, but mostly just keeping up with absolutely critical stuff, and taking it easy otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid and would get to stay home sick from school, I&amp;#39;d always play video games. My mom wouldn&amp;#39;t let me stay home unless I was actually pretty sick, but if I did, then I&amp;#39;d usually get to play for a while. Now I have this association with being sick and playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m finding myself at home, sick, trying to find a game to play. But, I can&amp;#39;t really even manufacture an interest for games anymore. Even after looking through a bunch of reviews, reddit threads, etc. I want to want to play something, but I can&amp;#39;t conjure it at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idk, has anyone else noticed a similar decline in interest in gaming over the years? I never thought I&amp;#39;d get old and stop playing games. But, here we are, and I&amp;#39;m only 30. Nowadays I mostly just want to read a book, browse Hacker News, or work on some side programming projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilme9gr/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1661362977.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wwbr8k", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ilmasea", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ilmasea", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "LoreSnacks", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1661361684.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wwbr8k", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_6nphjyn3", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "What's the best source for looking up nutritional information (mostly calories) on non-prepared food ingredients?
