['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 29, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_x0hc17", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 36, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661753708.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

I laid out a lot of math below. *Part of the reason I wrote this was that someone could tell me where I messed up.* \n\n**Current regime**\n\nThe [current IBR rules](https://www.financialrounds.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-income-based-repayment-ibr/) are that you pay at most 10% of your discretionary income (which I abbreviate DI here). DI is your income past 150% of the [Federal Poverty Rate (FPR)](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/).\n\nIf I am a single guy, 150% of FPR is $20,385. If I earn $100K, my DI is about 80K, meaning I never have to pay more than 8K a year. If this is not enough to cover interest, that interest goes away. Even if it were getting capitalized into the balance, [any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 years](https://www.financialrounds.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-income-based-repayment-ibr/) so who cares.\n\n([It used to be 25 years under \"old IBR\" but now we are in \"new IBR\"](https://fcaa.org/student-loan-repayment-plans/income-based-repayment/) and I guess we are about to get \"new new IBR\".\n\n$8000 is a lot of post-tax spending, but what incentives does it make?\n\n(I am going to make up a 5% interest rate for loans; this should be checked and numbers below reviewed on it changing).\n\nIf I take out **$93,000 in loans**, standard amortization means I will spend $8000 a year over 20 years to pay it down to zero. That **is the break-even point**. Each aditional dollar I borrow means $1.08 that disappears at the end.\n\n$93,000 is a lot of debt. [Only 4% get over 56K](https://www.aplu.org/our-work/5-archived-projects/college-costs-tuition-and-financial-aid/publicuvalues/student-debt.html) and only 0.5% hit 100K. Average medical debt is $200,000 but my numbers were based on a salary of $100,000 which doctors will eclipse.\n\nWhat if I run a family of 4? At $100,000 my DI is $58,375. That drops all the above loan numbers by about 30%. **$68,000 is still a lot of loans** to take out.\n\nBut let us change the salary. Average salary for a college graduate is around $55,000. For the single guy, that is a DI of $35,000, meaning annual payments of $3500. This is a DI of 44% of the original value, meaning **the break-even is now $40,700**. About 20% of graduates hit this level, eyeballing the earlier aplu.org link. This is starting to become a serious moral hazard.\n\nFor a family of 4 the DI at $55,000 is only $13375. That **requires only $15,600 in debt**. I am not so much worried about financially supporting a family of 4 making $55,000 as I am in giving them a direct incentive to go as expensive as possible once loans hit $15,600.\n\n\n\n**Proposed Regime**\n\nThe [new program](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2022/08/26/the-new-income-driven-repayment-system-could-cause-some-big-problems/) has these relevant changes:\n\n* Increase the amount of income not subject to IDR from 150 percent of the federal poverty line to 225 percent of the federal poverty line.\n\n* Eliminate any accrual of interest on IDR-enrolled loans.\n\n* For undergraduate debt, reduce the IDR rate from 10 percent of income beyond the threshold in (1) to 5 percent of income beyond the threshold in (1).\n\nItems 1 and 3 directly change my math. I will get back to item 2 later.\n\nSo now our fresh-college-graduate-single-guy-making-$100,000 has a DI of (100000 - 13590 * 2.2) or $70,000 and annual payments of $3500. This means **the break-even point is now $40,700.** If he has (or will soon have) a family of 4 his DI is now just $38,950 and will pay no more than $1,950 per year. **Just $22,600 in loans is the break-even**, meaning there is no difference to him between borrowing $22,600 and $93,000. Might as well go into luxury student housing, move the family in.\n\nThat average college grad making $55,000 with a family of 4? Your DI is *less than zero*. In fact, **any income up to $61,050 means you do not have to pay a single cent towards your loans**, as the balance stays flat and the 20-year timer ticks away.\n\nItem 2 is missing from my analysis. If I read it right, as long as your income is below the IBR threshold, no money gets added, but in a lot of my above analysis that did not matter because uncapitalized interest vanished.\n\nI guess it matters if you think you will have many years of salad days and then suddenly earn a lot of money. If you could get an extra dollar in financial aid and put it in a crummy retail bank savings account, that would still be a good idea. Either 20 years hits and you get to keep all the money, or your income goes up and you withdraw the money from the savings account to pay it back.\n\nI want to make up a web calculator that shows the break-even point for given circumstances, but first I need to figure out how many mistakes I made above.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_imu8nvt", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Income Based Repayment is totally insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People had pointed out that it was a reasonable part of the loan forgiveness.

Each aditional dollar I borrow means $1.08 that disappears at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$93,000 is a lot of debt. &lt;a href=\"https://www.aplu.org/our-work/5-archived-projects/college-costs-tuition-and-financial-aid/publicuvalues/student-debt.html\"&gt;Only 4% get over 56K&lt;/a&gt; and only 0.5% hit 100K. Average medical debt is $200,000 but my numbers were based on a salary of $100,000 which doctors will eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if I run a family of 4? At $100,000 my DI is $58,375. That drops all the above loan numbers by about 30%. &lt;strong&gt;$68,000 is still a lot of loans&lt;/strong&gt; to take out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let us change the salary. Average salary for a college graduate is around $55,000. For the single guy, that is a DI of $35,000, meaning annual payments of $3500. This is a DI of 44% of the original value, meaning &lt;strong&gt;the break-even is now $40,700&lt;/strong&gt;. About 20% of graduates hit this level, eyeballing the earlier aplu.org link. This is starting to become a serious moral hazard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a family of 4 the DI at $55,000 is only $13375. That &lt;strong&gt;requires only $15,600 in debt&lt;/strong&gt;. I am not so much worried about financially supporting a family of 4 making $55,000 as I am in giving them a direct incentive to go as expensive as possible once loans hit $15,600.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposed Regime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2022/08/26/the-new-income-driven-repayment-system-could-cause-some-big-problems/\"&gt;new program&lt;/a&gt; has these relevant changes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase the amount of income not subject to IDR from 150 percent of the federal poverty line to 225 percent of the federal poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminate any accrual of interest on IDR-enrolled loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For undergraduate debt, reduce the IDR rate from 10 percent of income beyond the threshold in (1) to 5 percent of income beyond the threshold in (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Items 1 and 3 directly change my math. I will get back to item 2 later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now our fresh-college-graduate-single-guy-making-$100,000 has a DI of (100000 - 13590 * 2.2) or $70,000 and annual payments of $3500. This means &lt;strong&gt;the break-even point is now $40,700.&lt;/strong&gt; If he has (or will soon have) a family of 4 his DI is now just $38,950 and will pay no more than $1,950 per year. &lt;strong&gt;Just $22,600 in loans is the break-even&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning there is no difference to him between borrowing $22,600 and $93,000. Might as well go into luxury student housing, move the family in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That average college grad making $55,000 with a family of 4? Your DI is &lt;em&gt;less than zero&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;any income up to $61,050 means you do not have to pay a single cent towards your loans&lt;/strong&gt;, as the balance stays flat and the 20-year timer ticks away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Item 2 is missing from my analysis. If I read it right, as long as your income is below the IBR threshold, no money gets added, but in a lot of my above analysis that did not matter because uncapitalized interest vanished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it matters if you think you will have many years of salad days and then suddenly earn a lot of money. If you could get an extra dollar in financial aid and put it in a crummy retail bank savings account, that would still be a good idea. Either 20 years hits and you get to keep all the money, or your income goes up and you withdraw the money from the savings account to pay it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to make up a web calculator that shows the break-even point for given circumstances, but first I need to figure out how many mistakes I made above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imu8nvt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1662148804.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_x0hc17", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 45}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_imu7i4x", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "imu7i4x", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "ymeskhout", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1662148336.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_x0hc17", "score": 38, "author_fullname": "t2_3whc1m0w", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "After Roe v.

But birds had no creator, no agent involved in their existence. We might be able to metaphorically talk about a bird being \"designed\" or \"built\" for flight, but it is only that: a metaphor.\n\nIf we want to limit our description to what can be described based on an physico-empirical view of reality, then a bird's wing's **make flight possible** or **allow them to fly**, but we can't speak about a bird's wings being \"for\" anything at all.\n\nSo too with the word \"need.\"\n\nDoes a seed \"need\" water and sunlight and nutrient rich soil? A metaphysical naturalist would say no. \"Need\" implies that there's some sort of goal, or right way for a seed to be, but the universe doesn't care if a seed dies or grows into a giant tree over many eons.\n\nHumans trying to grow seeds might \"need\" water, and fertilizer and a location with the right amount of sun in order to fulfill that goal, but regarding the seed itself we can only make predictions about the outcomes of different conditions on the seed.\n\nIf the seed experiences Scenario A (X units of water delivered at intervals Y, Z units of soil of composition W, V hours of average daily sun exposure, etc.) then it will grow into a big tree, but if the seed experiences Scenario B (no water, no sun, no soil) it will stay a seed and die, with a thousand possible predictions branching off from these two.\n\nSo what do we make of \"sex\" from this standpoint?\n\nI think the radical thing that this line of thinking implies is to stop thinking about \"man\" and \"woman\" as some sort of natural pairing.\n\nJust as there are seeds, and we can make predictions about what effects particular conditions will have on the seed, so too there are animals and we can make predictions about what effects particular conditions will have on those animals.\n\nIf the gamete of animal A finds its way to the gamete of animal B, we might get a zygote, or we might get nothing at all depending on the particular animals involved and the particular gametes.\n\nThings start to come down to categoricity and disciplined pattern formation.\n\nIs a penis \"for\" a vagina? Is an ovum \"for\" a sperm? Do men and women have some sort of complimentary relationship?\n\nIt is almost certain that humans come pre-installed with social hardware that predisposes them to think of human males and human females as belonging to one type or category in some sense - the human. But if we pull back the curtains, we can see an equally valid way of slicing up reality: men and women are different but \"related\" things.\n\nMen and women rely on each other to reproduce their own kind. Men can't make more of themselves without women, and women can't make more of themselves without men. But why think of them as part of one \"species\" or \"type\"? Sure, they share a lot of similarities, and can be contrasted against things like \"rabbits\" as a whole, even as one can draw parallels between \"human males\" and \"rabbit males.\"\n\nI believe it was Bret Weinstein who said that if alien biologists came down to Earth, they would rediscover the concept of sex every day. I don't exactly take issue with this claim, but I do wonder if the aliens would have the encyclopedia entry \"Humans\", or if there would be two encyclopedia entries \"[Human-Male]\" and \"[Human-Female].\"\n\nThere's one layer deeper to go here, though. Would the alien biologists even stop there? How would they deal with intersex individuals?\n\nI think a certain form of so-called \"binary\" thinking is to talk about there being men and women, with intersex individuals being deviations from the norm that can still be forced into one of those two boxes, or filed away into a \"freak of nature\" box (though we would never call it that with modern social mores.)\n\nBut I think this \"binary\" thinking has exactly the same problem that \"needs\"- or \"for\"-based thinking produces: it engages in teleological thinking.\n\nWe could imagine that instead of having abstractions at the level of \"man\" and woman\" that the alien biologists have a unique compound word for everything that basically contains every bit of information about that thing known to the aliens.\n\nAt this level, maybe the alien biologists could notice patterns between two things, which for us would become categories, but for them remain unabstracted, ungeneralized observations about the entirety of existing things. Maybe these aliens don't even have the concept of \"distinct things\" but instead build up observations from correlations of raw sensory data that doesn't get processed by modules in their brain into \"objects\" and \"animals\" and \"things\", but instead is dealt with as a Unity with sub-patterns within patterns that can be interacted with and about which predictions can be made.\n\nI think our brain modules do a lot of work in making certain \"categories\" seem more plausible than others, that is the source of the shadow of teleology projected back out into the world.

But birds had no creator, no agent involved in their existence.

A metaphysical naturalist would say no. &amp;quot;Need&amp;quot; implies that there&amp;#39;s some sort of goal, or right way for a seed to be, but the universe doesn&amp;#39;t care if a seed dies or grows into a giant tree over many eons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humans trying to grow seeds might &amp;quot;need&amp;quot; water, and fertilizer and a location with the right amount of sun in order to fulfill that goal, but regarding the seed itself we can only make predictions about the outcomes of different conditions on the seed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the seed experiences Scenario A (X units of water delivered at intervals Y, Z units of soil of composition W, V hours of average daily sun exposure, etc.) then it will grow into a big tree, but if the seed experiences Scenario B (no water, no sun, no soil) it will stay a seed and die, with a thousand possible predictions branching off from these two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what do we make of &amp;quot;sex&amp;quot; from this standpoint?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the radical thing that this line of thinking implies is to stop thinking about &amp;quot;man&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;woman&amp;quot; as some sort of natural pairing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as there are seeds, and we can make predictions about what effects particular conditions will have on the seed, so too there are animals and we can make predictions about what effects particular conditions will have on those animals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the gamete of animal A finds its way to the gamete of animal B, we might get a zygote, or we might get nothing at all depending on the particular animals involved and the particular gametes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things start to come down to categoricity and disciplined pattern formation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is a penis &amp;quot;for&amp;quot; a vagina? Is an ovum &amp;quot;for&amp;quot; a sperm? Do men and women have some sort of complimentary relationship?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is almost certain that humans come pre-installed with social hardware that predisposes them to think of human males and human females as belonging to one type or category in some sense - the human. But if we pull back the curtains, we can see an equally valid way of slicing up reality: men and women are different but &amp;quot;related&amp;quot; things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men and women rely on each other to reproduce their own kind.

That might mean models like guaranteeing a certain fixed price for electricity use under some ceiling and leaving market prices in force above that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imk54ww/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1661972700.0, "author_flair_text": "Chief Suomiposter", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_x0hc17", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 43}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1245, "name": "t1_im8j6bl", "id": "im8j6bl", "parent_id": "t3_x0hc17", "depth": 0, "children": ["im8j6bl", "imjh3kz", "im9xi04", "im8a4cm", "imfp7ja", "imcpyav", "im9l2aw", "im85d0q", "ime085j", "imhhqa5", "im9bicb", "imk3g7h", "imgofrm", "imalmyd", "imj4q5z", "imgejsp", "ime3y6y", "im9smmz", "im9lflo", "im90px1"]}}], "before": null}}]
