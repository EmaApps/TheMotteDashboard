The court hasn't ruled on a similar suit against OAN yet but, given that it is, in my opinion, the strongest of the three, I'd be willing to bet that this one moves forward as well. Dominion is suing these media companies for defamation, claiming that statements concerning their Venezuelan ties, role in rigging the 2020 election, etc. have damaged their business to the tune of billions of dollars. \n\nThe reason I'm seriously wondering if these two networks are finished is because, with these rulings, Dominion has cleared the biggest hurdle of the lawsuit. When defamation involves public figures and matters of public interest (as this defamation undoubtedly does), plaintiffs must show that the defendant acted with \"actual malice\"; that is, they must prove that the defamatory statements were made either with the express knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. This is a tough standard to meet and is why celebrities haven't put supermarket tabloids out of business. Media companies in the United States are given pretty wide latitude to report on rumors, allegations, and other items where certainty isn't exactly bulletproof. But if they have actual knowledge that something is untrue, and publish it anyway, they can be held liable. \"Reckless disregard\" is much slipperier, but the general idea is that if you have piles of evidence that strongly suggest that something isn't true you can't just publish it without cautionary language indicating the uncertainty surrounding it. As a caution, I'm only explaining all this to provide context for how this case may play out. I'm not interested in debating whether it's fair that something some liberal network said should be considered defamatory, because first, these cases are very fact dependent and I don't know all the facts about hypothetical MSNBC cockups, and, second, it's irrelevant unless there's actually a lawsuit. \n\nAnyway, this standard is notoriously difficult to meet, mainly because most entities worth suing are sufficiently sophisticated to avoid making false statements of fact. It should also be noted that the decisions don't conclusively say that the networks acted with actual malice, simply that Dominion has alleged enough facts that a reasonable jury could conclude that they acted with actual malice. I'd also note that I left Fox out of the headline because the case against them appears to be significantly weaker than the cases against Newsmax and OAN, and in any event they are more likely to be able to pay a settlement or verdict. Having failed to get a motion to dismiss, the networks can assert a number of defenses:\n\n**Truth:** I doubt they'll actually assert this, as it would essentially involve proving that Dominion has ties to Hugo Chavez and created software designed to rig the election. If the networks had any evidence of this they wouldn't have held onto it to be used in a future lawsuit.\n\n**Statement of Opinion:** Opinions are protected under the First Amendment. However, merely couching a defamatory statement as an opinion isn't enough to overcome a defamation claim; the courts aren't going to make it so you can get away with anything as long as you preface it with \"I think.\" This is one defense the networks are likely to assert, but proving it is going to be difficult. Given the sheer amount of coverage OAN and Newsmax gave to the Dominion allegations (with OAN seemingly airing Mike Lindell documentaries as fast as he could produce them), claiming that they were merely expressing an opinion with no intention of presenting the reporting as factual is going to be a hard sell.\n\n**Privilege:** Occasionally, there are certain situations where one is privileged to make defamatory statements without consequence. These usually relate to official proceedings\u2014court testimony, legislative sessions, etc. The one privilege that Newsmax, in particular, is claiming is a \"neutral reportage\" privilege that says in essence that when public figures make statements about matters of public concern, news organizations are privileged to report those allegations without fear of defamation. There are two obvious problems with this defense. The first is that it is derived from certain Circuit Court decisions that imply it's a First Amendment issue. This means that it's not a recognized common-law defense and isn't necessarily a protected constitutional right. So Newsmax is arguing that a state court should apply precedent from a Federal court that isn't even controlling over the entire Federal Court system; in effect, they want a Delaware court to give non-controlling law the force of a constitutional imperative, which isn't exactly firm footing. The second problem is that even if the court takes them up on their offer, it's highly unlikely that Newsmax meets the criteria required for protection. Without listing all the elements, it's clear that the privilege, to the extent that it exists, is intended to protect media agencies who neutrally and dispassionately report the contents of defamatory allegations without taking sides. Newsmax and OAN became All Fraud All the Time for months following the election, and repeatedly had guests like Sidney Powell repeating the allegations to sympathetic interviewers who offered little to no pushback, and in many cases parroted the allegations themselves. It's unlikely that any reasonable person could have watched either network's coverage of the election challenges for any period of time and come to the conclusion that they weren't putting forth any particular point of view. \n\n**Retraction:** If a defendant retracts the defamatory statements in a timely manner it will usually serve as an effective defense. This is a nonstarter her, however, since Dominion repeatedly asked the networks to issue retractions and not only did the networks refuse, but continued airing defamatory material in spite of these requests.\n\nGiven that the Actual Malice hurdle has been cleared and the available defenses aren't good, I'd say that the chances of a jury verdict are pretty high. The only real question is damages, but given that they're confident in asking for over a billion dollars, even a significant reduction would still be disastrous for Newsmax and OAN. These aren't large networks with a ton of cash lying around, and this probably wouldn't be their only debt. If a jury awards a tenth of what Dominion is asking they're probably looking at bankruptcy.\n\nThe most obvious counterargument to this is \"If the networks' cases are so bad, they'll just settle.\" The problem with this is that the networks couldn't offer any amount of money to make it worth it for Dominion to settle (the exception is Fox, but the case against Fox is much weaker and Fox has more money). Dominion isn't suing second-tier networks because it expects to get a lot of money. It's suing them to get vindication and rehabilitate their public image. The biggest issue for Dominion moving forward is that the taint of these allegations makes it difficult for them to get contracts. If a county is looking to replace its voting machines or renew an existing contract with Dominion, there is going to be a certain amount of public pressure to go with another vendor \"just to stay on the safe side\". I don't know the ins and outs of every state's bidding  procedures to know if a county can be forced into accepting a Dominion contract, but if there's any room for discretion a county may opt to ignore Dominion entirely just to avoid any possible controversy. The potential damages are unknowable, and Dominion is obviously erring on the high side, and Dominion knows that it can't possibly hope to recover for all the damage the allegations did. What they can hope for, however, is that a jury verdict stating not only are the allegations unproven or lacking in evidence (as some of the Powell lawsuit dismissals implied), but are demonstrably and indisputable false. False to the point that we're making those who repeated them publicly pay large sums of money. It's not perfect, but it's probably the best Dominion can hope for.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_if7s8d3", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is This the End of Newsmax and OAN?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is coming a bit late, but over the past month or so, a court in Delaware has denied motions to dismiss in Dominion&amp;#39;s lawsuits against Newsmax and Fox News. The court hasn&amp;#39;t ruled on a similar suit against OAN yet but, given that it is, in my opinion, the strongest of the three, I&amp;#39;d be willing to bet that this one moves forward as well. Dominion is suing these media companies for defamation, claiming that statements concerning their Venezuelan ties, role in rigging the 2020 election, etc. have damaged their business to the tune of billions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I&amp;#39;m seriously wondering if these two networks are finished is because, with these rulings, Dominion has cleared the biggest hurdle of the lawsuit. When defamation involves public figures and matters of public interest (as this defamation undoubtedly does), plaintiffs must show that the defendant acted with &amp;quot;actual malice&amp;quot;; that is, they must prove that the defamatory statements were made either with the express knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. This is a tough standard to meet and is why celebrities haven&amp;#39;t put supermarket tabloids out of business. Media companies in the United States are given pretty wide latitude to report on rumors, allegations, and other items where certainty isn&amp;#39;t exactly bulletproof. But if they have actual knowledge that something is untrue, and publish it anyway, they can be held liable. &amp;quot;Reckless disregard&amp;quot; is much slipperier, but the general idea is that if you have piles of evidence that strongly suggest that something isn&amp;#39;t true you can&amp;#39;t just publish it without cautionary language indicating the uncertainty surrounding it. As a caution, I&amp;#39;m only explaining all this to provide context for how this case may play out. I&amp;#39;m not interested in debating whether it&amp;#39;s fair that something some liberal network said should be considered defamatory, because first, these cases are very fact dependent and I don&amp;#39;t know all the facts about hypothetical MSNBC cockups, and, second, it&amp;#39;s irrelevant unless there&amp;#39;s actually a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this standard is notoriously difficult to meet, mainly because most entities worth suing are sufficiently sophisticated to avoid making false statements of fact. It should also be noted that the decisions don&amp;#39;t conclusively say that the networks acted with actual malice, simply that Dominion has alleged enough facts that a reasonable jury could conclude that they acted with actual malice. I&amp;#39;d also note that I left Fox out of the headline because the case against them appears to be significantly weaker than the cases against Newsmax and OAN, and in any event they are more likely to be able to pay a settlement or verdict. Having failed to get a motion to dismiss, the networks can assert a number of defenses:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth:&lt;/strong&gt; I doubt they&amp;#39;ll actually assert this, as it would essentially involve proving that Dominion has ties to Hugo Chavez and created software designed to rig the election. If the networks had any evidence of this they wouldn&amp;#39;t have held onto it to be used in a future lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statement of Opinion:&lt;/strong&gt; Opinions are protected under the First Amendment. However, merely couching a defamatory statement as an opinion isn&amp;#39;t enough to overcome a defamation claim; the courts aren&amp;#39;t going to make it so you can get away with anything as long as you preface it with &amp;quot;I think.&amp;quot; This is one defense the networks are likely to assert, but proving it is going to be difficult. Given the sheer amount of coverage OAN and Newsmax gave to the Dominion allegations (with OAN seemingly airing Mike Lindell documentaries as fast as he could produce them), claiming that they were merely expressing an opinion with no intention of presenting the reporting as factual is going to be a hard sell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privilege:&lt;/strong&gt; Occasionally, there are certain situations where one is privileged to make defamatory statements without consequence. These usually relate to official proceedings\u2014court testimony, legislative sessions, etc. The one privilege that Newsmax, in particular, is claiming is a &amp;quot;neutral reportage&amp;quot; privilege that says in essence that when public figures make statements about matters of public concern, news organizations are privileged to report those allegations without fear of defamation. There are two obvious problems with this defense. The first is that it is derived from certain Circuit Court decisions that imply it&amp;#39;s a First Amendment issue. This means that it&amp;#39;s not a recognized common-law defense and isn&amp;#39;t necessarily a protected constitutional right. So Newsmax is arguing that a state court should apply precedent from a Federal court that isn&amp;#39;t even controlling over the entire Federal Court system; in effect, they want a Delaware court to give non-controlling law the force of a constitutional imperative, which isn&amp;#39;t exactly firm footing. The second problem is that even if the court takes them up on their offer, it&amp;#39;s highly unlikely that Newsmax meets the criteria required for protection. Without listing all the elements, it&amp;#39;s clear that the privilege, to the extent that it exists, is intended to protect media agencies who neutrally and dispassionately report the contents of defamatory allegations without taking sides. Newsmax and OAN became All Fraud All the Time for months following the election, and repeatedly had guests like Sidney Powell repeating the allegations to sympathetic interviewers who offered little to no pushback, and in many cases parroted the allegations themselves. It&amp;#39;s unlikely that any reasonable person could have watched either network&amp;#39;s coverage of the election challenges for any period of time and come to the conclusion that they weren&amp;#39;t putting forth any particular point of view. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retraction:&lt;/strong&gt; If a defendant retracts the defamatory statements in a timely manner it will usually serve as an effective defense. This is a nonstarter her, however, since Dominion repeatedly asked the networks to issue retractions and not only did the networks refuse, but continued airing defamatory material in spite of these requests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given that the Actual Malice hurdle has been cleared and the available defenses aren&amp;#39;t good, I&amp;#39;d say that the chances of a jury verdict are pretty high. The only real question is damages, but given that they&amp;#39;re confident in asking for over a billion dollars, even a significant reduction would still be disastrous for Newsmax and OAN. These aren&amp;#39;t large networks with a ton of cash lying around, and this probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be their only debt. If a jury awards a tenth of what Dominion is asking they&amp;#39;re probably looking at bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most obvious counterargument to this is &amp;quot;If the networks&amp;#39; cases are so bad, they&amp;#39;ll just settle.&amp;quot; The problem with this is that the networks couldn&amp;#39;t offer any amount of money to make it worth it for Dominion to settle (the exception is Fox, but the case against Fox is much weaker and Fox has more money). Dominion isn&amp;#39;t suing second-tier networks because it expects to get a lot of money. It&amp;#39;s suing them to get vindication and rehabilitate their public image. The biggest issue for Dominion moving forward is that the taint of these allegations makes it difficult for them to get contracts. If a county is looking to replace its voting machines or renew an existing contract with Dominion, there is going to be a certain amount of public pressure to go with another vendor &amp;quot;just to stay on the safe side&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t know the ins and outs of every state&amp;#39;s bidding  procedures to know if a county can be forced into accepting a Dominion contract, but if there&amp;#39;s any room for discretion a county may opt to ignore Dominion entirely just to avoid any possible controversy. The potential damages are unknowable, and Dominion is obviously erring on the high side, and Dominion knows that it can&amp;#39;t possibly hope to recover for all the damage the allegations did. What they can hope for, however, is that a jury verdict stating not only are the allegations unproven or lacking in evidence (as some of the Powell lawsuit dismissals implied), but are demonstrably and indisputable false. False to the point that we&amp;#39;re making those who repeated them publicly pay large sums of money. It&amp;#39;s not perfect, but it&amp;#39;s probably the best Dominion can hope for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/if7s8d3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1657206773.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_vr0t4v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_if66ryn", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "if66ryn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": "LOW_SCORE", "no_follow": true, "author": "SebJenSeb", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1657171002.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_vr0t4v", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_kdzw2y90", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": true, "body": "short post, but are there any legitimate arguments against the genetic race/iq stuff anymore?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_if66ryn", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;short post, but are there any legitimate arguments against the genetic race/iq stuff anymore?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": "comment score below threshold", "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/if66ryn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1657171002.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_vr0t4v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": "991bceb0-301f-11e9-a749-0ed81f530880", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_if4jc0o", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "if4jc0o", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "MelodicBerries", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1657142757.0, "send_replies": false, "parent_id": "t3_vr0t4v", "score": 27, "author_fullname": "t2_40utrd39", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "**The death of the American Middle-Class**.\n\nMuch has been written about this topic in terms of outsourcing or trade, but the NYT has a decent [data-rich article](https://archive.ph/m93RC) showing how US cities are increasingly bifurcated onto \"poor\" or \"rich\" areas with a disappearing middle. \n\nA few excerpts:\n\n&gt; And in Orlando, nearly 70 percent of area residents lived in \u201caverage\u201d neighborhoods back in 1990, according to census data.

My intention in this post is not to defend the desire theory though - it's just to critique the entitlement theory.\n\nActually, I'm skeptical that the idea of \"acting out of a sense of entitlement\" is even coherent.  Entitlement seems to me, first and foremost, to be an objective relation that obtains between you and something else, not a psychological attitude that you take towards something else.  To be entitled to X is to be in a legal or social relation with X that grants you control over or access to X.  Your attitudes and motivations don't enter into the picture.  \n\nIndeed, when I try to imagine thought experiments where I or someone else is primarily motivated to act by a \"sense of entitlement\", I'm not sure if I can do it.  It always seems more appropriate to use other concepts to explain the motivations instead - raw desire, or protecting one's wounded pride, or maintaining the coherence of one's self-image, or any number of things.  But it's hard to think of a scenario where \"entitlement\" seems like an appropriate psychological concept to explain someone's motivations.  Ultimately, it seems that it's just a sneer-like word, too pre-loaded with moral judgment to be explanatorily useful.\n\nIt seems more plausible to defend the idea that someone could act out of a *mistaken belief* that they are entitled to something, rather than acting out of raw entitlement itself.  These sorts of scenarios are much easier to imagine.  But is this what men actually do?  I think not.  What man actually believes that he's entitled to sexual access to women in today's Western society?  I've seen no evidence that any sizable number of men actually believe this, but I've seen plenty of evidence to the contrary.\n\nConsider the discourse that circulates in \"manosphere\", \"The Red Pill\", and \"pick-up artist\" forums.  I don't know how you can walk away with any belief other than that these men are *acutely* aware that they are *not* entitled to sexual access to women in any way.  They become completely obsessed with the idea of self-improvement, because the only alternative in their view is dying bitter and alone.  Every day is a constant Darwinian struggle against other men for access to extremely scarce reproductive resources.  Even if they are able to secure a long-term relationship or even marriage with a woman, they are never allowed a moment's rest.  They constantly have to be on top of their game, always striving to assert dominance, otherwise their woman will leave them for Chad Thundercock at the drop of a hat.

If men do what they do because of biological drives, then that means we just have to live with it, which is horrifying.  But if men do what they do because they've been instilled with a false sense of entitlement, then we can just educate them on the appropriate way to have relations with women and everything will be fine.  So the thinking goes.  I make no judgments here - I'm just outlining my thinking on why feminism is structurally predisposed to adopt certain theories over others.\n\nOf course, I don't think that male sexual behavior *entirely* reduces to basic biological desires.

Early on in the game, there is [a cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXeHwhLPKz8) of the Christian hymn [*Are You Washed in the Blood?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Washed_in_the_Blood) that plays as part of a dramatic setpiece battle. I found the cover really quite catchy, and went to listen to it outside the game and find the original hymn (I hadn't heard it before). Apparently I wasn't the only one who enjoyed the song and many other Wasteland 3 players did the same. However, I found their comments on the 'genuine' renditions by actual Christian artists to be very strange to me. They frequently describing the tone and lyrics (and the Youtube comments of Christians) on the song as 'creepy' or 'cultish'.\n\nIt's obvious why people find the Wasteland 3 version creepy. It's a pretty sinister sounding rendition and you hear it when you the player are fighting a post-apocalyptic inbred redneck cult family while destruction and blood surround you. The 'genuine' versions are more tricky. Clearly [many Christians listening to the hymn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJWgpljckbA) don't feel it's creepy, but fulfilling and positive.\n\nMaybe the non-Christians finding it creepy have a point. Lyrics like \"washed in the Blood of the Lamb\" and \"are your garments spotless\" do sound very strange or creepy devoid of any context. But these lyrics *aren't* devoid of context, it's clearly a Christian hymn. Rather, non-Christians (secularized Americans) don't *understand* the context. They don't know what the 'Blood' or 'Lamb' means or represents. They are illiterate of the language of Christianity.

Seemingly the only engagement contemporary secular America has with Christian themes is negative, cynical and superficial portrayals in media. Typically some evil redneck evangelical doomsday cult that serves as than antagonist who is more that happy to use Christian symbols in their evil plans.

Early on in the game, there is &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXeHwhLPKz8\"&gt;a cover&lt;/a&gt; of the Christian hymn &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Washed_in_the_Blood\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are You Washed in the Blood?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that plays as part of a dramatic setpiece battle. I found the cover really quite catchy, and went to listen to it outside the game and find the original hymn (I hadn&amp;#39;t heard it before). Apparently I wasn&amp;#39;t the only one who enjoyed the song and many other Wasteland 3 players did the same. However, I found their comments on the &amp;#39;genuine&amp;#39; renditions by actual Christian artists to be very strange to me. They frequently describing the tone and lyrics (and the Youtube comments of Christians) on the song as &amp;#39;creepy&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;cultish&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s obvious why people find the Wasteland 3 version creepy. It&amp;#39;s a pretty sinister sounding rendition and you hear it when you the player are fighting a post-apocalyptic inbred redneck cult family while destruction and blood surround you. The &amp;#39;genuine&amp;#39; versions are more tricky. Clearly &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJWgpljckbA\"&gt;many Christians listening to the hymn&lt;/a&gt; don&amp;#39;t feel it&amp;#39;s creepy, but fulfilling and positive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the non-Christians finding it creepy have a point. Lyrics like &amp;quot;washed in the Blood of the Lamb&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;are your garments spotless&amp;quot; do sound very strange or creepy devoid of any context. But these lyrics &lt;em&gt;aren&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; devoid of context, it&amp;#39;s clearly a Christian hymn. Rather, non-Christians (secularized Americans) don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the context. They don&amp;#39;t know what the &amp;#39;Blood&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;Lamb&amp;#39; means or represents. They are illiterate of the language of Christianity. As a cultural/lapsed Catholic, I wouldn&amp;#39;t consider myself &lt;em&gt;fluent&lt;/em&gt; in &amp;#39;Christian&amp;#39;, but I&amp;#39;m certainly literate enough that I don&amp;#39;t find the lyrics of the song creepy and can easily understand their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like hearing an idiom literally translated from another language. e.g. the Swedish idiom &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;to shit in a blue cupboard&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;.

I looked it up, and apparently [the core concept](https://moralinjuryproject.syr.edu/about-moral-injury/) is about war:\n\n&gt; Within the context of military service, particularly regarding the experience of war, \"moral injury\" refers to the lasting emotional, psychological, social, behavioral, and spiritual impacts of actions that violate a service member\u2019s core moral values and behavioral expectations of self or others.\n\nIn other words, it's the deep spiritual and psychological damage that happens when soldiers are ordered to do things that conflict with their personal moral codes: killing people, taking actions that lead to civilian casualties, having to abandon friends on the battlefield to accomplish the mission. Serious, earth-shattering things like that. Some of the deepest horrors of war.\n\nBut the poster I saw wasn't about the experiences of veterans or the terror of the battlefield. It was about \"a nurse who feels ashamed of having a medical condition because she's a nurse.\"\n\nTo me, this feels like a substantial deviation from the original definition of \"moral injury.\" An \"injury to pride,\" maybe.

Sometimes earth-shatteringly hard. I know it can sometimes feel like a war-zone, a constant fight against death and injury that can never be won, a perpetual Afghanistan withdrawal. I also know it can be especially hard on nurses, who do so much to keep our hospitals and clinics going and are often under-appreciated (is that too much of a clich\u00e9?).

If you're one of those people who hasn't read it since Middle School or haven't read it at all the Declaration is a short document, and today is as good a day as any and better than most. \n\n&gt;#IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776 THE UNANIMOUS DECLARATION OF THE THIRTEEN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA#\n`\n&gt;When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature\u2019s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  \n\n&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. - That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, - That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. \u2014 Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  \n\n&gt;He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  \n\n&gt;He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  \n\n&gt;He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  \n\n&gt;He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  \n\n&gt;He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  \n\n&gt;He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  \n\n&gt;He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.  \n\n&gt;He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.  \n\n&gt;He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  \n\n&gt;He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.  \n\n&gt;He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.  \n\n&gt;He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.  \n\n&gt;He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation.  \n\n&gt;Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States.\n\n&gt;For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world.\n\n&gt;For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent.\n\n&gt;For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury.\n\n&gt;For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences.\n\n&gt;For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies.\n\n&gt;For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments.\n\n&gt;For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\n&gt;He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\n&gt;He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\n&gt;He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\n&gt;He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\n&gt;He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\n&gt;In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  \n\n&gt;Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.  \n\n&gt;We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. \u2014 And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.  \n\n- Signing for Massachusetts:  \nJohn Hancock, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Robert Treat Paine, Elbridge Gerry\n\n- Signing for New Hampshire:  \nJosiah Bartlett, William Whipple, Matthew Thornton\n\n- Signing for Rhode Island:  \nStephen Hopkins, William Ellery\n\n- Signing for Connecticut:  \nRoger Sherman, Samuel Huntington, William Williams, Oliver Wolcott\n\n- Signing for New York:  \nWilliam Floyd, Philip Livingston, Francis Lewis, Lewis Morris\n\n- Signing for New Jersey:  \nRichard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, Abraham Clark\n\n- Signing for Pennsylvania:  \nRobert Morris, Benjamin Rush, Benjamin Franklin, John Morton, George Clymer, James Smith, George Taylor, James Wilson, George Ross\n\n- Signing for Delaware:  \nCaesar Rodney, George Read, Thomas McKean\n\n- Signing for Maryland:  \nSamuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, Charles Carroll of Carrollton\n\n- Signing for Virginia:  \nGeorge Wythe, Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Harrison, Thomas Nelson, Jr., Francis Lightfoot Lee, Carter Braxton\n\n- Signing for North Carolina:  \nWilliam Hooper, Joseph Hewes, John Penn\n\n- Signing for South Carolina:  \nEdward Rutledge, Thomas Heyward, Jr., Thomas Lynch, Jr., Arthur Middleton\n\n- Signing for Georgia:  \nButton Gwinnett, Lyman Hall, George Walton\n\nedit: formatting", "edited": 1656955856.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ieu8z57", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy fourth of July everyone.

A majority of Americans favor *some* restrictions on abortion.  A majority of Americans *oppose* a blanket ban.  Setting the poles of the debate at \"all or nothing\" creates [duelling purity spirals](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vjpec0/dobbs_v_jackson_womens_health_organization/idq2mlt/) that tear apart all the reasoned and nuanced discussion between those positions.  But one of the most famous \"pro-choice\" essays in the philosophical literature, where Judith Jarvis Thompson introduces the violinist case, concludes:\n\n&gt; I do argue that abortion is not impermissible, [but] I do not argue that it is always permissible... [A] sick and desperately frightened fourteen-year-old schoolgirl, pregnant due to rape, may of course choose abortion, and... any law which rules this out is an insane law... It would be indecent in the woman to request an abortion, and indecent in a doctor to perform it, if she is in her seventh month, and wants the abortion just to avoid the nuisance of postponing a trip abroad.\n\nBy contrast, if you check the [Republican Party platform](https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf), it states unequivocally:\n\n&gt; Numerous studies have shown that abortion endangers the health and well-being of women, and we stand firmly against it.\n\nThe [Democratic Party platform](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-Democratic-Party-Platform.pdf) is arguably more equivocal, but \"**every** woman should be able to access...safe and legal abortion\" does strictly include abortion for women who are 40 weeks pregnant, though this is of course not what \"the majority of Americans\" believe:\n\n&gt; We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion.\n\nBack to the Gallup poll--check the chart called \"Trends in Preferred Abortion Label, by Gender.\"  In May of 2022, a historical high of 61% of women identified as \"pro-choice.\"  This is just three years after 2019's poll, in which a quarter-century high of 51% of women identified as pro-life.  This change is substantially underwritten by a rather abrupt explosion of \"legal under any circumstances\" women, and collapse of \"illegal in all circumstances\" women.  Just at a guess, timing wise the polls go \n\n&gt; low support for unconditional abortion --&gt;\n\n&gt; Kavanaugh --&gt;\n\n&gt; rising support for unconditional abortion --&gt; \n\n&gt; Coney Barrett --&gt; \n\n&gt; all-time high support for unconditional abortion\n\nIn other words, people tend to default toward pro-life type positions (or pro-life type positions just get more consistently pushed), but dropping abortion into the news cycle shifts people quickly back toward pro-choice type positions.  And \"all-time high\" may be a little misleading, as the mid-1990s saw similarly high \"legal under any circumstances\" support from women (37% then, 38% today).\n\nI know that many of you did not live through the 1990s, or were too young to be aware of the culture wars, but culturally it was an era of fairly strident feminism.  Hillary Clinton was personally responsible for some small part of that, but so was *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992), to say nothing of Hollywood.  Disney's *Beauty and the Beast* (1991) deliberately appealed to feminist tropes, \"girl power\" was, if not coined, at least popularized in that era (the Spice Girls played some role in this, though more recently they have [disavowed the slogan](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/spice-girls-say-people-power-not-girl-power-should-back-theresa/), for presumably CW-adjacent reasons).  All this is in turn downstream from the feminism of the 1980s and 1970s, or maybe arguably a culmination of those influences.  By the 1990s, though, all the fresh-faced feminists of the Summer of Love had grown up, gotten jobs, had children, and otherwise installed themselves into positions of influence, even if only as reliably Democratic voters.\n\nThere is a lot of debate about \"wave\" feminism and what each \"wave\" entails, but whether these numbers indicate a new \"wave\" of feminism, they seem to indicate *something*.  The salience of \"women's issues\" is particularly great in a nation where women consistently outnumber men at the polls, by fairly wide margins.  So for almost *one woman in five* to go from labeling herself \"pro-life\" to \"pro-choice\" in the space of three years seems like an important shift, even if drilling down into those numbers reveals more nuanced attitudes that are *mostly* within historically-attested ranges. \n\nSince *Dobbs* has moved the issue to the states, where there are fifty wildly-diverse legislative and judicial bodies prepared to fuck things up in a million new and exciting ways, this is likely to go on for several years at least.  I anticipate media amping the feminist signal ([here is a young adult books editor calling for abortion books in a since-deleted tweet](https://bleedingcool.com/comics/scholastic-editor-calls-for-ya-books-graphic-novels-about-abortion/), for example) akin to what we saw in the 1990s, building on the memetic success of the execrable and behindhanded \"Handmaid's Tale.\"  What is unclear to me is the payoff.  \n\nPainting with a broad brush, if we think of first wave feminism as receding once suffrage was secured, and second wave feminism as receding once it eliminated legal barriers to women's social equality, third wave feminism arguably came for the \"systemic\" bits, the left-over oppression that persisted in civilization's social and political habits--like \"gender identity\" and \"gender roles.\"  Each wave of feminism contains seeds of its successor (all are a part of the same ocean) but still there are clustered trends.  So what's left for feminism after that?  More specifically: what *difference between men and women* remains to be erased?  And how does \"legal abortion under any circumstances\" capture it?\n\n(My own hasty guess is something like \"finding ways to eliminate the biological differences between men and women,\" but I see the face of transhumanism on tortillas and burnt toast so possibly I am not a reliable analyst in this regard.)", "edited": 1656938479.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iet735c", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dobbs&lt;/em&gt; megathread is over a week old now, and never did reach 2000 posts, so I think it&amp;#39;s probably safe to let it lapse... that said, I have been thinking &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/245618/abortion-trends-gender.aspx\"&gt;one of these charts&lt;/a&gt; over the past week, and wondered what you all might make of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate the labels &amp;quot;pro-life&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pro-choice,&amp;quot; for what I think are well-trod reasons.

Just at a guess, timing wise the polls go &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;low support for unconditional abortion --&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kavanaugh --&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;rising support for unconditional abortion --&amp;gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coney Barrett --&amp;gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;all-time high support for unconditional abortion&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, people tend to default toward pro-life type positions (or pro-life type positions just get more consistently pushed), but dropping abortion into the news cycle shifts people quickly back toward pro-choice type positions.  And &amp;quot;all-time high&amp;quot; may be a little misleading, as the mid-1990s saw similarly high &amp;quot;legal under any circumstances&amp;quot; support from women (37% then, 38% today).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that many of you did not live through the 1990s, or were too young to be aware of the culture wars, but culturally it was an era of fairly strident feminism.  Hillary Clinton was personally responsible for some small part of that, but so was &lt;em&gt;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&lt;/em&gt; (1992), to say nothing of Hollywood.  Disney&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; (1991) deliberately appealed to feminist tropes, &amp;quot;girl power&amp;quot; was, if not coined, at least popularized in that era (the Spice Girls played some role in this, though more recently they have &lt;a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/spice-girls-say-people-power-not-girl-power-should-back-theresa/\"&gt;disavowed the slogan&lt;/a&gt;, for presumably CW-adjacent reasons).  All this is in turn downstream from the feminism of the 1980s and 1970s, or maybe arguably a culmination of those influences.  By the 1990s, though, all the fresh-faced feminists of the Summer of Love had grown up, gotten jobs, had children, and otherwise installed themselves into positions of influence, even if only as reliably Democratic voters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of debate about &amp;quot;wave&amp;quot; feminism and what each &amp;quot;wave&amp;quot; entails, but whether these numbers indicate a new &amp;quot;wave&amp;quot; of feminism, they seem to indicate &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.  The salience of &amp;quot;women&amp;#39;s issues&amp;quot; is particularly great in a nation where women consistently outnumber men at the polls, by fairly wide margins.  So for almost &lt;em&gt;one woman in five&lt;/em&gt; to go from labeling herself &amp;quot;pro-life&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;pro-choice&amp;quot; in the space of three years seems like an important shift, even if drilling down into those numbers reveals more nuanced attitudes that are &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; within historically-attested ranges. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;Dobbs&lt;/em&gt; has moved the issue to the states, where there are fifty wildly-diverse legislative and judicial bodies prepared to fuck things up in a million new and exciting ways, this is likely to go on for several years at least.  I anticipate media amping the feminist signal (&lt;a href=\"https://bleedingcool.com/comics/scholastic-editor-calls-for-ya-books-graphic-novels-about-abortion/\"&gt;here is a young adult books editor calling for abortion books in a since-deleted tweet&lt;/a&gt;, for example) akin to what we saw in the 1990s, building on the memetic success of the execrable and behindhanded &amp;quot;Handmaid&amp;#39;s Tale.&amp;quot;  What is unclear to me is the payoff.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Painting with a broad brush, if we think of first wave feminism as receding once suffrage was secured, and second wave feminism as receding once it eliminated legal barriers to women&amp;#39;s social equality, third wave feminism arguably came for the &amp;quot;systemic&amp;quot; bits, the left-over oppression that persisted in civilization&amp;#39;s social and political habits--like &amp;quot;gender identity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;gender roles.&amp;quot;  Each wave of feminism contains seeds of its successor (all are a part of the same ocean) but still there are clustered trends.  So what&amp;#39;s left for feminism after that?  More specifically: what &lt;em&gt;difference between men and women&lt;/em&gt; remains to be erased?  And how does &amp;quot;legal abortion under any circumstances&amp;quot; capture it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(My own hasty guess is something like &amp;quot;finding ways to eliminate the biological differences between men and women,&amp;quot; but I see the face of transhumanism on tortillas and burnt toast so possibly I am not a reliable analyst in this regard.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/iet735c/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1656937614.0, "author_flair_text": "nihil supernum", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_vr0t4v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 51}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 140, "name": "t1_iesl0eg", "id": "iesl0eg", "parent_id": "t3_vr0t4v", "depth": 0, "children": ["iesl0eg"]}}], "before": null}}]
