Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!'

When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can.

than usual. An escaped convict, a cartel member, murdered five members of a family in Texas. Reasoning why this story hit me hard, I concluded that the crime I find significant is not the crime that is measured in graphs and figures. I think we\u2019re measuring crime incorrectly and should be fighting crime differently. \n\nIn terms of the betterment of society, a criminal killing a well-adjusted citizen is worse than a criminal killing another criminal. Much crime in America is criminal-on-criminal. This should be modified a bit, because criminality is a spectrum, not a matter of violating the letter of the law. The person who spends his time hanging out with gang members, boosting their posts on social media, and egging on his friends to commit violence is less innocent than the well-adjusted citizen, and is also more *oriented* toward criminality, despite never violating the letter of the law. \n\nThe moral person endures pain and sacrifice to work towards the betterment of society, and the criminal does the opposite. The moral person feels the sting of long hours at work, the pangs of unfulfilled desire, and love for neighbor as he navigates life to make the world better. The criminal chooses violence and hate. A criminal killing an innocent moral person is worse for society than a criminal killing a criminal. And a criminal killing the criminally-inclined is better for society than a criminal killing the morally-inclined. Criminals are not the kinds of people we want in society to begin with.\n\nAnd so a criminal killing five members of a moral family is an egregious crime against society that we\u2019re not able to really quantify and measure. We have no idea how prevalent the phenomena of \u201ccrime against innocents\u201d is, whether this is increasing or decreasing. And we probably have disagreements over exactly how significant the life of an innocent is relative to that of a criminal. For instance, is a criminal killing an innocent *twice* as bad as criminal-on-criminal? Is it ten times as bad? 100? \n\nI want to propose a new value scheme for thinking about crime. The scheme is this:\n\n(1) the only crime worth caring about and deterring is criminal-on-innocent crime. The more innocent the victim, the worse the crime.\n\n(2) The criminally-inclined killing the criminally-inclined is not merely *less bad*, it\u2019s actually *good*. We should be increasing the amount of criminals killing each other in society, other things being equally. \n\nWhile this last point comes off as edgy, I believe it would make the world better with limited drawback. There are ways to encourage criminals to kill each other without negative consequences. \n\nThe first way is an area of a city cordoned off, where criminals can commit violence with no legal repercussion. We already have de facto areas of cities like this, where police don\u2019t patrol and where the solved homicide rate is perhaps 10%. I simply think this should be a legally-recognized expanded practice.\n\nThe second way is a national \u201cbattle royale\u201d event for 16+ men with a prize pool of $40,000, something low enough to deter good and intelligent people, but high enough to encourage would-be criminals. In order to deter any accidental reinforcement of criminality in society, the event would be held without recordings. It can be advertised in high crime areas of the country.\n\nCriminality is a natural variation of human biodiversity. We will always have criminals, no matter the policies we instantiate. In the past, the violent-prone would be enjoying a life of killing in war parties, becoming state-sponsored pirates, dueling each other to the death and killing each other outside taverns.\n\nOur greatest hope should be to remove criminals from society as quickly as possible, with the least harm inflicted on innocents. Putting criminals behind bars is needlessly expensive, when we can simply permit them to kill each other in specified contexts. Who are we to say criminals shouldn\u2019t live out their destiny anyway? [Hundreds of species](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/mammal-adulticide/619512/) kill each other, from bears and lions to primates and walruses. We would not suppose to hold court over nature, or presume that these animals should be barred from inflicting violence. So it is with violent humans. It makes sense to allow them to commit violence against each other, which cancels out the problem in a cost-efficient and self-selecting way. \n\nWhile the above is the most palatable version of my idea, I actually think we should go a step beyond and raise the battle royale prize pool while publicly televising the event. This would have the effect that, over consecutive generations, those who are the most *inherently deterred* from violence will be selected for in society. Those who want to commit violence, and who cannot reason about longterm gain, will be gradually filtered out of society. All of this would occur in a way that respects a person\u2019s freedom and right to self-determination, so I don\u2019t really see anything wrong with it morally.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ib5guzz", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came across a &lt;a href=\"https://www.khou.com/article/news/crime/tomball-isd-family-killed-in-centerville-texas/285-ad1274ed-db15-4c2e-b2d0-54948156479c\"&gt;news story&lt;/a&gt; that made me more upset than usual.

Is it ten times as bad? 100? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to propose a new value scheme for thinking about crime. The scheme is this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(1) the only crime worth caring about and deterring is criminal-on-innocent crime. The more innocent the victim, the worse the crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(2) The criminally-inclined killing the criminally-inclined is not merely &lt;em&gt;less bad&lt;/em&gt;, it\u2019s actually &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. We should be increasing the amount of criminals killing each other in society, other things being equally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While this last point comes off as edgy, I believe it would make the world better with limited drawback. There are ways to encourage criminals to kill each other without negative consequences. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first way is an area of a city cordoned off, where criminals can commit violence with no legal repercussion. We already have de facto areas of cities like this, where police don\u2019t patrol and where the solved homicide rate is perhaps 10%. I simply think this should be a legally-recognized expanded practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second way is a national \u201cbattle royale\u201d event for 16+ men with a prize pool of $40,000, something low enough to deter good and intelligent people, but high enough to encourage would-be criminals. In order to deter any accidental reinforcement of criminality in society, the event would be held without recordings. It can be advertised in high crime areas of the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Criminality is a natural variation of human biodiversity. We will always have criminals, no matter the policies we instantiate. In the past, the violent-prone would be enjoying a life of killing in war parties, becoming state-sponsored pirates, dueling each other to the death and killing each other outside taverns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our greatest hope should be to remove criminals from society as quickly as possible, with the least harm inflicted on innocents. Putting criminals behind bars is needlessly expensive, when we can simply permit them to kill each other in specified contexts. Who are we to say criminals shouldn\u2019t live out their destiny anyway? &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/mammal-adulticide/619512/\"&gt;Hundreds of species&lt;/a&gt; kill each other, from bears and lions to primates and walruses. We would not suppose to hold court over nature, or presume that these animals should be barred from inflicting violence. So it is with violent humans. It makes sense to allow them to commit violence against each other, which cancels out the problem in a cost-efficient and self-selecting way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the above is the most palatable version of my idea, I actually think we should go a step beyond and raise the battle royale prize pool while publicly televising the event. This would have the effect that, over consecutive generations, those who are the most &lt;em&gt;inherently deterred&lt;/em&gt; from violence will be selected for in society. Those who want to commit violence, and who cannot reason about longterm gain, will be gradually filtered out of society. All of this would occur in a way that respects a person\u2019s freedom and right to self-determination, so I don\u2019t really see anything wrong with it morally.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/v0trau/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_may_30_2022/ib5guzz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1654354775.0, "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_v0trau", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": "991bceb0-301f-11e9-a749-0ed81f530880", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ib3mvbv", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ib3mvbv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Doglatine", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1654304385.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_v0trau", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_a8hrp", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "**Some quick thoughts on value change**\n\nHi all, apologies for the absence etc., but just had a quick social observation I wanted to share.

The two that are relevant here are [this one](https://www.aclu.org/bio/alok-vaid-menon) from the ACLU, and [this one](https://podcasts.apple.com/sn/podcast/alok-vaid-menon-does-your-soul-have-a-gender/id1566052074?i=1000545615735&amp;l=fr) from Metaphysical Milkshake.\n\nNow, throughout these interviews Alok makes a number of specific claims about the history of ideas surrounding gender non-conformity, as well as some arm-chair psychologizing of their opponents that I could pick apart or steelman, but I don't think there's as much value in that as tackling what I consider the central point of their advocacy: that the \"Western gender binary\" restricts people's freedom and autonomy, perpetuates unjust hierarchies, squashes people's natural spontaneity and playfulness around gender, and reduces people's self-expression, and that a world without gender (as well as other \"binary\" forms of thinking) would be better.\n\nI think the minimal, steelmanned description of \"the Western gender binary\" is something like: the set of societal expectations and rules that coerce or at least push men and women to act, dress and think in certain ways in places in the cultural sphere of the West.\n\nPut this minimal way, I think even if someone has issues with the whole concept of \"gender\" or thinks this discussion is poisoned by post-modernism and cloudy thinking, they could probably agree that the phrase has a real referrent. Even if the \"Western gender binary\" is far weaker than it was, say, 100 years ago, it's still considered notable and \"strange\" when men wear dresses and put on make up, and there are still particular ways both sexes are expected to act in certain contexts.\n\nI think it is trivially true that people would act in different ways in a society without a \"Western gender binary\", and that the \"Western gender binary\" restricts self-expression. However, are all form of societal coercion that \"restrict self-expression\" bad?\n\nI can think of several examples of arbitrary societal rules that only survive because some minimal level of coercion happens interpersonally that don't seem that bad to me.\n\n**Rules of etiquette**: Many etiquette rules are essentially arbitrary. There's no practical explanation for why walking through the mall flipping off people is bad, but going through the mall showing my pinky to people is just a bit strange and eccentric. Within the lingusitic-symbolic community of the anglophone West we decided that flipping someone off is a sign of anger and disrespect. Does this limit self-expression? Sort of. It limits the particular ways you can convey your ideas, the same way that the arbitrary decision to make the symbols \"dog\" refer to a specific animal limits the particular ways you can refer to things. But within these arbitrary limitations, a world of self-expression is still open to people. You just have to \"learn the language\" or accept that people are going to be confused when you try to use your middle finger to mean \"good day, sir\" and you use \"dog\" to mean \"rainbow.\"\n\n**\"Neutral\" Clothing Rules**: If I wear a robot costume in my day-to-day life, it is considered, at the very least, eccentric. Heck, I would probably have a lot of judgements and opinions of a stranger I met who always wore a robot costume in their everyday life. It is likely that a person who always wore robot costumes would be passed over for certain jobs, and might have trouble getting bank loans and the like. In a certain sense, it seems to me that society coercively punishes robot-costume-guy to a degree similar to many trans or gender non-conforming people, and yet my intuition says that the kind of societal coercion that robot-costume-guy is subjected to isn't \"unjust\", even if it is essentially arbitrary.\n\nOne reason to treat robot-costume-guy differently than GNC people might be some belief that gender non-conformance might be taken to generally be a deep expression of a person's identity, while few people in society consider it reasonable to treat the propensity to wear robot costumes this way. Liberal democracies already carve out a space for certain kinds of religious expression, out of a belief that a person's deep philosophical convictions are easier to \"work around\" than directly confront. The amish want to not be part of social security because of their deeply held religious beliefs? Sure, why not? We can make that compromise and avoid the headache of trying to coerce them to participate.\n\nPerhaps a similar argument could be made about gender non-conformity. It's too much of a headache trying to force everyone to dress and act in certain ways (be they legal or merely social and interpersonal.) So having a legal and social policy of \"tolerance\" and non-violence against non-conformists might represent a compromise for the sake of the experiment of Enlightenment philosophy and liberal society.\n\nI'll stop at those two examples for now.\n\nOverall, my main objections don't come from a specific place of defense of the \"Western gender binary.\" My main objection is more practical and pragmatic.\n\nI don't think it is possible to create a society where there is no arbitrary \"coercion\" of any kind, broadly defined. Humans are tribal animals, and there will always be people making in-group and out-group judgements based on arbitrary distinctions like clothing, behavior, and use of particular linguistic-symbolic signifiers within a culture.\n\nEven if we succesfully removed the \"Western gender binary\", we would still be driven to socially coerce people towards and away from particular lifestyles, hobbies, professions and forms of self-expression. I think that is fine as long as people aren't punished beyond some limit of violence.\n\nAs long as the coercion is in the form of \"softer\" persuassion and not direct violence or harm, I don't think it is bad or undesirable to have essentially arbitrary rules enforced by society.\n\nIf hypothetically corsets were as bad as Hollywood and pop culture said they were, and women were expected to wear them, that would be worth changing. But if women are expected to, say, wear the color pink, then I don't think that's necessarily a norm worth tearing down the gender binary for.

It started with someone posting on Reddit (and this subsequently [screenshotted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SamQari/status/1529868644846641153)) about how, as a child, they were not offered dinner when playing at their Swedish friend's place. This was then confirmed as a Swedish (and, to some degree, a general Nordic) custom by other posters. Much bewilderment and condemnation of the Swedish culture as a child-starving horror show has followed, by other Europeans as well as non-Europeans.\n\nI recognize the no-dinner custom from my own Finnish childhood, I do not recollect ever being offered dinner when at one of my friend's place or vice versa, or ever asking for it. Now, there is some confusion about the specific nature of \"dinner\". Even if there is no dinner, I do not remember like there is no food offered to guests \\*at all\\*, when people visit each other, there is going to be snacks or cake or whatever, even copious amounts of it. Perhaps the Swedes are different? In certain ways the Swedes are the most \u201cNordic\u201d of all Nordics. At least if you consider how many non-Nordics see Nordics as prim, proper and quietly smugly arrogant, well, that\u2019s how other Nordics see the Swedes.\n\nIt is obvious that at other places of the world, if there was a child of some other family playing at your place, they will get invited for dinner as a matter of course. Like with all \u201csocial norms,\u201d it is not like they are uniformly observed by the entire society. Looking at local discussions, I have seen many people claim amazement over idea. It should be noted that within Finland, there seems to be an internal division between Eastern Finland and Western Finland, perhaps the main cultural regions of Finland (this division even shows in [Finnish genetics](https://www.fimm.fi/en/research/projects/finnpopgen)). I\u2019m firmly from Eastern Finland, which is less like Sweden and more like the rest of the world, so maybe Westerners are more firm about not serving food to those outside family?\n\nIn the end, it all goes back to one of the strongest, yet often conscious, norms of Nordic life: it is shameful for an adult individual to be dependent on another individual, and it is shameful to make another adult individual dependent on you.\n\nThis norm leads to the peculiar Nordic idea of individualism meeting collectivism. Of course, the \u201cindividualism\u201d part of this is obvious, one can fundamentally obviously see how this norm creates a society of strong individuals (and families). However, the collectivism aspect is that the same norm is a major building block of the welfare state. It is not OK to depend on another \\*individual\\* or make them dependent on you\u2026 but impersonal institutions are a whole another thing!\n\nEveryone needs a helping hand at times, and it is completely different, in this thinking, if the helping hand is provided by a community that you are a part of and contribute to, not a specific person. In the old times, the community would of course usually be your local village/town, or parish (often the same thing), and later strong societies were created around trade unions, which used to function in a manner not unlike a guild in the pre-welfare-state times, with extensive networks of mutual services, ranging from mutual funds to sports to newspapers and such.\n\nNowadays, the welfare state, usually conceptualized as an entire nation forming a similar community, serves the same role. The expectation is precisely that there is a social contract; when you can work and at your prime, you work hard, and in exchange the state provides the \u201csafety net\u201d for the times when you cannot do this. Debates on where the line goes between something being a legit utilization of this social contract and when it becomes mooching off the society \u2013 a cardinal sin \u2013 are extremely common in local political debates, and grist for the press.\n\nNow, I specifically mentioned \u201cadults\u201d here, and obviously children need adults to sustain them, and there is nothing wrong with it. However, the idea is then that it is specifically a family\u2019s job to sustain their child. This then creates the second-order effects that are noted here; the other family feels uncomfortable giving a dinner to the child, since it might make the child\u2019s parents feel like the other family is making them moochers. Likewise, the child themselves might refuse dinner, if offered \u2013 if they have already internalized the unconscious social norms behind all this.\n\nOnce one realizes that this is the norm, it is easy to see why certain other things separating the Nordic countries from others exist. For instance, when people go to bars, they buy their own drinks; buying rounds is rare, unless there is a special event (or you are drunk enough for norms to not matter). People on dates buy their own dinners. Tipping is almost non-existent. Domestic services are not utilized as much as they could be cleaning companies put up little notices on their home pages that you do not need to clean up before the cleaning person comes in.\n\nAdult children leave their parents\u2019 homes as soon as they can after adulthood, and the adults practically push them out the nest. It\u2019s probably also one of the reasons why feminism made such fast headway in the North \u2013 Nordic feminism has always been very much a movement oriented around getting women to work so they don\u2019t have to be dependent on their husbands and other men. And so on.\n\nOf course, put it this way and it sounds like total moon logic, considering that the easiest thing to do would be just, you know, feeding the child. This all works out on an unconscious level, and that is one of the reasons these habits are on their way out. Other reasons would be the general \u201cEuropeanization\u201d of Nordic cultures, as the EU has a habit of slowly grinding away the edges of all national cultures towards an undefined, bland and gray \u201cEuropean\u201d ideal).

It was Mr. Camus, a socialist turned far-right populist, who popularized the term \u201cle grand remplacement\u201d in a novel by that name in 2011.\n\nMr. Gendron, according to the documents he posted, seemed to have read none of those; instead he attributed the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d notion to the online writings posted by the gunman who murdered 51 Muslims at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019.\n\nAfter that attack, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, spearheaded an international pact, called the Christchurch Call, that saw government and major tech companies commit to eliminate terrorist and extremist content online. Though the agreement carried no legal penalties, the Trump administration refused to sign, citing the principle of free speech.\n\nMr. Gendron\u2019s experience online shows that the writings and video clips associated with the Christchurch shooting remain available to inspire other acts of racially motivated violence. He referred to both repeatedly.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League warned last year that the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d had moved from the fringes of white supremacist beliefs toward the mainstream, pointing to the chants of protesters at the 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Va., that erupted in violence and the commentaries of Tucker Carlson on Fox News.\n\n\u201cMost of us don\u2019t know the original story,\u201d Mr. Ward of the Southern Poverty Law Center said. \u201cWhat we know is the narrative, and the narrative of the great replacement theory has been credentialized by elected officials and personalities to such an extent that the origins of the story no longer need to be told. People are beginning to just understand it as if they might understand conventional wisdom. And that\u2019s what is frightening.\u201d\n\nFor all the efforts some major social media platforms have made to moderate content online, the algorithms they use \u2014 often meant to show users posts that they will read, watch and click \u2014 can accelerate the spread of disinformation and other harmful content.\n\nMedia Matters for America, a liberal-leaning nonprofit, said last month that its researchers found at least 50 ads on Facebook over the last two years promoting aspects of the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d and related themes. Many of the ads came from candidates for political office, even though the company, now known as Meta, announced in 2019 that it would bar white nationalist and white separatist content from Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe organization\u2019s researchers also found that 907 posts on the same themes on right-wing sites drew more 1.5 million engagements, far more than posts intended to debunk them.\n\nAlthough Mr. Gendron\u2019s video of the shooting was removed from Twitch, it resurfaced on 4chan, even while he was still at the scene of the crime. The video has since spread to other fringe platforms like Gab and ultimately mainstream platforms like Twitter, Reddit and Facebook.\n\nThe advent of social media has in a fairly short period of time enabled nefarious ideas and conspiracies that once simmered in relative isolation to proliferate through society, bringing together people animated by hate, said Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not isolated anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been connected.\u201d\n\n***\n\nA couple points of interest:\n\n1. They paint it as a conspiracy theory, and repeatedly refer to it as such, by defining it as being attributed to the jews. This was not, for example, how tarrant (new zealand shooter) framed it, and is otherwise not a neccessary part of such theories. The attribution might be to a variety of things, and might not be a conspiracy theory at all. They track the propagation of adjacent theories to mainstream politicians on facebook. They fail to mention the exact rhetoric used  in facebook ads, but one suspects such ads avoid naming the jew. So the version used by these politicians might not have the part that makes it a conspiracy theory, or even false, at all. So point one is a discussion of the way the media uses dishonesty to reframe issues. And we might also reflect on how this leads to radicalization etc.\n\n2. Such theories are referred to here as being \"white supremacist\" and \"white nationalist\". This is more likely to be true of such theories in general. To what degree does that make them evil? We know, for example, that members of most ethnicities prefer to see the propagation of their ethnicity. We know, furthermore, that when an ethnicity is prevented from propagating itself, this is called genocide, and is one of the worst crimes imaginable. So, clearly we will accept white supremacy adjacent rhetoric in some cases. What specifically about use of such rhetoric by white people makes it evil? Point two thus discusses whether we should allow such rhetoric to exist, or ban it from major platforms.\n\n3. We might go a step farther, and question whether we should *necessarily* agree with such ideas. If, after all, every race (here defined in the old sense, as not being merely skin color) throughout history has been interested in its survival and success, shouldn't we take the hint that this is a good thing to care about? On the other hand, we modernists seem to be hedonists in the nth degree. What does it matter to us if we achieve anything besides pleasure and pain while living? Or perhaps we care about our \"race\", but we define our \"race\" as *american* (or whatever country you happen to be from). If white americans die out, but brown americans live on, this is hardly a concern for us. But how is the latter reasoning any more valid? Caring about people who happen to be citizens in the same territory as us is hardly more worthwhile than caring about people who happen to share our skin color. Thus, the third point concerns whether we ought to be white supremacists too.\n\n4. Perhaps the problem is specifically that without being a conspiracy theory, such theories are quite meaningless. After all, if the blame for the white race dying is... white people, then we can hardly claim that something evil is happening. Some people are choosing not to reproduce. Others are still having children. Killing a bunch of black people does nothing when the problem is white people. Killing white people would be... counter-productive. There are a slim few policy proposals for raising fertility rates, but none that I'm aware of have been shown effective. Mass shooter rarely propose them anyways. So this white supremacy, good or bad, is merely a dying breath, a swan song. The fourth point questions whether this specifically is why white supremacy is evil. \n\n5. To wrap things up, we might question the degree to which the media itself is complicit in the decline of white fertility. If the problem were well known, and furthermore was well established as *a problem*, people might reasonably choose to have more children to make up for the slack. Instead, organizations like the NYT choose to publish articles pretending it isn't happening at all, and arguing that anyone complaining about it is a white supremacist and thus evil. It seems like a major organization like the NYT could choose to turn the issue around, and yet they don't. So the fifth point concerns the role of the media and broader culture in producing this outcome.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iasy9yh", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might as well discuss this NYT article:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/01/technology/fringe-mainstream-social-media.html\"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/01/technology/fringe-mainstream-social-media.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discusses the Buffalo shooter, but the main thesis, and the part we&amp;#39;ll focus on, has to do with the great replacement theory:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the center of the shooting, like others before it, was a false conviction that an international Jewish conspiracy intends to supplant white voters with immigrants who will gradually take over political power in America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy, known as the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d has roots reaching back at least to the czarist Russian antisemitic hoax called \u201cThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\u201d which purported to be a Jewish plot to overtake Christianity in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It resurfaced more recently in the works of two French novelists, Jean Raspail and Renaud Camus, who, four decades apart, imagined waves of immigrants taking power in France.

Monkeypox is a poxvirus (same family as smallpox, chickenpox) which is known to be transmissible by contact with bodily fluids and by contact with contaminated fabrics. The memorandum sent by my institution says that it is *suspected* to be transmissible by droplets. In this context, droplets are airborne particles larger than aerosols. While an N95 mask is generally required to control airborne infections, a paper surgical mask is generally sufficient when handling droplet infections. So, what does our institution recommend? \n\nThe official policy of our institution in the case of a verified case of monkeypox is patients who test positive for monkeypox to be kept in a negative-pressure room *with full airborne disease precautions*, and requires the attending medical staff to wear a **Level D suit with PAPR** (red underlined text in the original memo): a big white balloon suit, complete with air tank.\n\nMeanwhile, the CDC (in the US) has some recommendations of its own. The CDC's guide for [\"Infection Control: Healthcare Settings | Monkeypox\"](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/infection-control-healthcare.html) reads \n\n&gt; Activities that could resuspend dried material from lesions, e.g., use of portable fans, dry dusting, sweeping, or vacuuming should be avoided. ... A patient with suspected or confirmed monkeypox infection should be placed in a single-person room; special air handling is not required. The door should be kept closed (if safe to do so). The patient should have a dedicated bathroom. Transport and movement of the patient outside of the room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If the patient is transported outside of their room, they should use well-fitting source control  (e.g., medical mask) and have any exposed skin lesions covered with a sheet or gown.\n\nSo we have a tale of two responses. The US CDC gives an \"evidence-based\" response: poxviruses are not known to be transmissible in the air, and are known to be transmissible by bodily fluids. The US CDC would have us worry about contamination from skin lesions. Meanwhile, the Korean response is to apply the precautionary principle: droplet transmission has not been ruled out, so patients go in the negative pressure ward and doctors wear full biohazard suits.\n\nI think there's a cultural difference in this response to monkeypox. Part of this is that I remember the exact same dynamics in the our response to Covid: while public health professionals in the US were wringing their hands over how medical professionals wearing masks would cause patients to be irrationally afraid, our institution was sending out memos recommending that *all* staff wear N95 masks, even non-medical staff, and mandating Level D precautions for treatment of Covid patients (white paper biohazard suit with facemask and N95 but without the PAPR). I think this culture of precaution regarding emerging diseases was probably a major part of the reason that Seoul was able to control spread early in the Covid outbreak. The hospital response probably bought time to organize the testing-and-tracing program which was so successful (until Omicron and full vaccination shifted the cost/benefit ratio. The tracing program has now been wound down.)\n\nThe origin of this cultural difference was probably the [2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome_outbreak_in_South_Korea). During that outbreak 186 patients were infected, mostly via transmission within a few Seoul hospitals which were sloppy with infection control. Of these patients, 38 died. The response was a public outcry and renewed procedures for early outbreak response.\n\nI guess the moral of the story is that from 2015 to 2019, South Korea was able to form a rigorous epidemic response policy, whereas from 2019 to 2022 the US CDC seems to be sticking to strategies which cover their ass (\"evidence-based\"), but which are taking a gamble in the case that the disease is actually airborne.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iao602x", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Korean medical institution just posted an announcement informing staff of precautions to take (and symptoms to look for) related to monkeypox infection, and I would like to reflect on it here as it brought back very strong memories of the early days of Covid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, about monkeypox.

The tracing program has now been wound down.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The origin of this cultural difference was probably the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome_outbreak_in_South_Korea\"&gt;2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. During that outbreak 186 patients were infected, mostly via transmission within a few Seoul hospitals which were sloppy with infection control. Of these patients, 38 died. The response was a public outcry and renewed procedures for early outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess the moral of the story is that from 2015 to 2019, South Korea was able to form a rigorous epidemic response policy, whereas from 2019 to 2022 the US CDC seems to be sticking to strategies which cover their ass (&amp;quot;evidence-based&amp;quot;), but which are taking a gamble in the case that the disease is actually airborne.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/v0trau/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_may_30_2022/iao602x/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1654010014.0, "author_flair_text": "lives under a rock", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_v0trau", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 33}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_iamdvj4", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iamdvj4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "FiveHourMarathon", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1653966983.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_v0trau", "score": 43, "author_fullname": "t2_it3nfidt", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "In honor of Memorial Day, and because I just finished Tooze's *The Deluge*, let's jump back to one of the great moments of \"Donald Trump get's in trouble for telling the truth.\"\n\n[Trump Faces Fallout From Report He Calls Military 'Suckers'](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/04/909599762/trump-faces-fallout-from-report-he-calls-military-losers-and-suckers)\n\nMerriam Webster defines a Sucker as (among other irrelevant things):\n\n&gt;: a person easily cheated or deceived\n\nBut there's an absent actor in the definition, who was the one who cheated them, who took advantage of their gullibility?\n\nThe reason the usual neoliberal suspects were offended by WWI war dead being called suckers wasn't the implication that the soldiers were stupid, it was the implication that their man Woodrow Wilson was the Con-Man in the exchange.

That when you need to REALLY engage in the culture war, the wellness of children can be given lesser weight as a potential tradeoff, it&amp;#39;s not sacred, it&amp;#39;s just another tradeoff you have to make or a tradeoff that you can collectively ignore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/v0trau/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_may_30_2022/iajkoec/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1653918030.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_v0trau", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 22}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": "991bceb0-301f-11e9-a749-0ed81f530880", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_iajjmfp", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iajjmfp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Amadanb", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1653917467.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_v0trau", "score": 24, "author_fullname": "t2_wksm4", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "**Semi-regular Ban Report**\n\nThree posts have been removed by AEO since the last report.
