['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 08, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wj1cwt", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 32, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1659939308.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

This will necessarily be high-level; my low-level summaries are available at [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative\\_analysis\\_of\\_the\\_inflation\\_reduction/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative_analysis_of_the_inflation_reduction/), with a top level thread for each title, and summaries under each.\n\nMy first impression is of how /sane/ all this seems - accepting the premise that we will all literally die if we're not net-zero by 2050 (or whatever goal is being set for whatever reason, don't @ me) - this is a legitimate full-court press to electrify GHG producers, enable consumer and industrial deployment of low-emissions tech and enhanced energy efficiency, deploy renewable energy at scale, adapt to incoming warming and extreme weather, and enable research into new forms of renewable energy.

A pithy statement of it is \"Never dine alone with a woman\". For Pence, it goes a bit further and he also won't consume alcohol without his wife present.   \n  \nWhen this came to light after Pence's vice presidential nomination in 2016, it inspired a furor overnight. Some [claimed it was sexist](https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-abcarian-pence-marriage-20170405-story.html), [Kamala Harris called it \"outrageous\"](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/14/kamala-harris-pence-women-1221741), and some commentators have even [questioned its legality](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/3/31/15132730/pence-women-alone-rule-graham-discrimination).

In his opinion, movements like #MeToo make Pence's personal code of etiquette unavoidable because there aren't other ways to avoid the implied \"New Puritanism\". Quoting from [the *Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/pence-wife-billy-graham-rule/521298/), \"Socially liberal or non-religious people may see Pence\u2019s practice as misogynistic or bizarre. For a lot of conservative religious people, though, this set-up probably sounds normal, or even wise. The dust-up shows how radically notions of gender divide American culture.\" With a description as apt as that, whatever you feel about it, Pence's personal is now [certainly political](https://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=0ba7b595-8da9-4e63-a0ec-aec0639e4af6).  \n\nSo what happens when we have a society-wide experiment in forcing Pence's rule on people? [A recent preprint](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105976) alleged that was exactly what happened in the area of economic research. The TL;DR of the result is that post-#MeToo, male economists became more wary of collaborating with female economists. This effect was stronger when university policies on \"impersonal harassment\" were more ambiguous and when the number of past public sexual harassment cases at a university was higher. The effects are a bit scattered, but some clear findings ring out. Despite their proportions of the sample remaining unchanged despite #MeToo, female economists became less productive afterwards. This reduced productivity can be substantially (60%) attributed to the direct effects of having fewer collaborations with male economists, whose own productivity hasn't been affected. The effect on female economists' productivity was broad. Female economists were not less likely to work with women alone or women and men together, but they were less likely to work with men alone. This extended to new projects and new papers. They were not less likely to collaborate with untenured colleagues, but they were less likely to collaborate with tenured people, and this seems to be due to the fact that the tenured colleagues were at higher-ranking universities, which saw larger reductions in cross-sex collaboration. After #MeToo, female economists were less likely to initiate new projects with new and existing coauthors and this effect was due to reductions in the numbers of new projects with new coauthors inside the university and of new projects with new coauthors outside of their university. The same pattern was seen for coauthorships more generally.   \n\nSo this paper argues that what happens when we start practicing what we're told in 2 Timothy 2:22 is that women take a professional hit. The author of this paper offered [two](https://twitter.com/marinambgg/status/1557714978747981824) [stories](https://twitter.com/marinambgg/status/1557714981587546114) to explain these results.  \n\n&gt;Men think \u201c#MeToo means if I accidentally say the wrong thing, I\u2019ll be cancelled/fired. I\u2019d better stay away from women.\u201d Clear policies show that \u201csaying the wrong thing\u201d doesn\u2019t get you cancelled/fired, so clear policies reduce men\u2019s (perceived) risk of #MeToo. \n\nand  \n\n&gt;Women think \u201c#MeToo means I don\u2019t have to work with the predator men anymore, so I\u2019ll avoid them.\u201d If that\u2019s the story, we should see the decrease in collaborations regardless of whether policies are clear or not.  \n \nAnd, to be fair, both of these stories might be true to different degrees. Policy ambiguity does not explain the whole reduction in collaborations. Because this *is* the case, unless the authors' policy ambiguity measures weren't good enough, her suggestion that \"#MeToo plus clear policies could create awareness for sexual harassment without hurting women\u2019s productivity\" may be misguided. Sure, ambiguity reduction looks like it could cut against these changes a bit, but if we trust her measurement we have to conclude that the damage is done. #MeToo has made us all evangelicals, and women are some of the victims of that change.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ijwb99h", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second Epistle to Timothy 2:22 in the New International Version reads &amp;quot;Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&amp;quot; The principle outlined here has also been called the &amp;quot;Modesto Manifesto&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;Billy Graham Rule&amp;quot;, and more recently, the &amp;quot;Mike Pence Rule&amp;quot;.

The NYT makes it sound like long waitlists are the main reason the UK is ditching this model, but another very strong reason is because the clinic ignored mental health issues in favor of beginning medical transition.  The clinic faces a [class action lawsuit](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/4e7fc538-18dc-11ed-b1f4-627a202c7457?shareToken=8c10508fb9e9acdd02579f7a5207924c) from families who believe their child was negligently misdiagnosed by the clinic.  \n\nAn independent review of the Gender Identity Development Service by [Dr Hilary Cass](https://cass.independent-review.uk/publications/interim-report/) appears to be a significant catalyst.

The one that came to mind, that has a similar feeling to me, is Alex Honnold, the man who freeclimbed El Capitan. Like stealing an airplane, freeclimbing El Capitan is ill-advised, and yet undeniably glorious. Obviously Alex didn't have to steal anything, and Alex didn't die doing it. Alex planned, and didn't break any laws. But still. The feeling I get from both resonate, harmonize. Maybe it's close to the admiration I have for Ted Kaczynski, who more than all else lived his morals and implemented them as he saw fit. Of course, while Alex didn't kill anyone and didn't die, and Richard didn't kill anyone but himself, Ted killed other people, and is still alive (for now). Ted's not glorious, not like Alex, not like Richard, even. Maybe I'm just a sucker for iconoclasts, and don't have the moral fortitude to decry their transgressions. Maybe I'm just confused.\n\nI don't really have a point with this post, other than to mark the anniversary of Richard's flight. I'd be curious to know if this story affected anyone here like it did me, if anyone can recognize the kind of wistfulness I feel, and if there are any other people or stories who make them feel the same way. Maybe there's a German word that describes it, one I don't know.\n\nFor anyone not familiar, here are some links.\n\nhttps://mynorthwest.com/1076542/planes-temporarily-grounded-at-sea-tac-airport-for-security-breach/\n\nhttps://counter-currents.com/2020/08/sky-king/\n\nhttps://theamericansun.com/2018/10/06/the-last-flight-of-the-white-man/\n\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/beebo-russell-seattle-plane-theft-true-story-1187023/\n\nThe \"full\" audio of the air traffic call: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNWoomWgYAc", "edited": 1660155623.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ijr0gxb", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today marks four years since Richard Russell stole a plane from SeaTac airport, did a barrel roll, then crashed into a remote island.

In his version of history, the generals of the Third Reich had been completely subservient to Hitler; this was the model he wanted for his military. Kelly told Trump that there were no such American generals, but the President was determined to test the proposition.\n\nand\n\n&gt;Milley had already spoken out publicly against the banning of transgender troops, which Trump was insisting on.\n\n&gt;\u201cMattis tells me you are weak on transgender,\u201d Trump said.\n\n&gt;\u201cNo, I am not weak on transgender,\u201d Milley replied. \u201cI just don\u2019t care who sleeps with who.\u201d\n\nthe piece also raises all kinds of troubling questions on civil-military relations, the deep state and the extent to which elected officials (like Trump) can be constrained by unelected bureaucrats. According to it, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marc Milley led the \"Resistance\" (TM) inside the Pentagon:\n\n&gt;\u201cFuck that shit,\u201d Milley told his staff. \u201cI\u2019ll just fight him.\u201d The challenge, as he saw it, was to stop Trump from doing any more damage, while also acting in a way that was consistent with his obligation to carry out the orders of his Commander-in-Chief. Yet the Constitution offered no practical guide for a general faced with a rogue President. Never before since the position had been created, in 1949\u2014or at least since Richard Nixon\u2019s final days, in 1974\u2014had a chairman of the Joint Chiefs encountered such a situation. \u201cIf they want to court-martial me, or put me in prison, have at it,\u201d Milley told his staff. \u201cBut I will fight from the inside.\u201d\n\nThe piece further outlines Milley's efforts to stymie any attempt by Trump to order the military to \"start an unnecessary war overseas\" or \"be used in the streets against the American people for the purpose of keeping Trump in power\". In particular, it refers to discussions about attacking Iran:\n\n&gt;Miller\u2019s behavior did not look intentional so much as unhelpful to Milley, as Trump kept asking for alternatives, including an attack inside Iran on its ballistic-weapons sites. Milley explained that this would be an illegal pre\u00ebmptive act: \u201cIf you attack the mainland of Iran, you will be starting a war.\u201d During another clash with Trump\u2019s more militant advisers, when Trump was not present, Milley was even more explicit. \u201cIf we do what you\u2019re saying,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all going to be tried as war criminals in The Hague.\u201d\n\n&gt;Trump often seemed more bluster than bite, and the Pentagon brass still believed that he did not want an all-out war, yet he continued pushing for a missile strike on Iran even after that November meeting. If Trump said it once, Milley told his staff, he said it a thousand times. \u201cThe thing he was most worried about was Iran,\u201d a senior Biden adviser who spoke with Milley recalled. \u201cMilley had had the experience more than once of having to walk the President off the ledge when it came to retaliating.\u201d\n\n&gt;The biggest fear was that Iran would provoke Trump, and, using an array of diplomatic and military channels, American officials warned the Iranians not to exploit the volatile domestic situation in the U.S. \n\nSeems quite shocking that American officials would engage in back-channel communications with the Iranians to frustrate their own commander-in-chief. The piece details other efforts by Milley to slow-walk Trump's orders and while the authors justify it by saying he considered them unlawful it seems more appropriate to say that he considered them ill-thought-through and disagreed with them. Which raises the question of whether he should've resigned if he felt unable to carry out his duties due to differences of opinion with the president. But the piece explains that he considered resigning but instead chose to stay on the inside to \"fight back\" against the president. When presented in such a way, his behavior may be viewed troubling, bordering on insubordinate.\n\nAnother question raised is the role of the process. The article alleges that Trump ordered an immediate withdrawal from Afghanistan and Somalia without consulting the chairman of the joint chiefs. Milley refused to carry out the order and instead assembled like-minded advisors and went to the White House to convince Trump to walk it back. Are the POTUS' orders legitimate because they come from the president or because they went through the institutionalized process of formulating them? Even though abstractly it's the former, in the real world it is the process that seems to legitimize the orders. This has interesting implications in all kinds of areas, from democratic governance (is it enough to disrupt the process as on Jan 6 to stop democracy from functioning?) to medical treatments (can we short-circuit the FDA approval process to bring drugs into use faster?).", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iji0yyw", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/inside-the-war-between-trump-and-his-generals\"&gt;new piece&lt;/a&gt; is making the rounds today on the war between Trump and his generals.

Milley explained that this would be an illegal pre\u00ebmptive act: \u201cIf you attack the mainland of Iran, you will be starting a war.\u201d During another clash with Trump\u2019s more militant advisers, when Trump was not present, Milley was even more explicit. \u201cIf we do what you\u2019re saying,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all going to be tried as war criminals in The Hague.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trump often seemed more bluster than bite, and the Pentagon brass still believed that he did not want an all-out war, yet he continued pushing for a missile strike on Iran even after that November meeting. If Trump said it once, Milley told his staff, he said it a thousand times. \u201cThe thing he was most worried about was Iran,\u201d a senior Biden adviser who spoke with Milley recalled. \u201cMilley had had the experience more than once of having to walk the President off the ledge when it came to retaliating.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest fear was that Iran would provoke Trump, and, using an array of diplomatic and military channels, American officials warned the Iranians not to exploit the volatile domestic situation in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seems quite shocking that American officials would engage in back-channel communications with the Iranians to frustrate their own commander-in-chief. The piece details other efforts by Milley to slow-walk Trump&amp;#39;s orders and while the authors justify it by saying he considered them unlawful it seems more appropriate to say that he considered them ill-thought-through and disagreed with them. Which raises the question of whether he should&amp;#39;ve resigned if he felt unable to carry out his duties due to differences of opinion with the president. But the piece explains that he considered resigning but instead chose to stay on the inside to &amp;quot;fight back&amp;quot; against the president. When presented in such a way, his behavior may be viewed troubling, bordering on insubordinate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another question raised is the role of the process. The article alleges that Trump ordered an immediate withdrawal from Afghanistan and Somalia without consulting the chairman of the joint chiefs. Milley refused to carry out the order and instead assembled like-minded advisors and went to the White House to convince Trump to walk it back. Are the POTUS&amp;#39; orders legitimate because they come from the president or because they went through the institutionalized process of formulating them? Even though abstractly it&amp;#39;s the former, in the real world it is the process that seems to legitimize the orders. This has interesting implications in all kinds of areas, from democratic governance (is it enough to disrupt the process as on Jan 6 to stop democracy from functioning?) to medical treatments (can we short-circuit the FDA approval process to bring drugs into use faster?).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/iji0yyw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1659996696.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wj1cwt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 45}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": "991bceb0-301f-11e9-a749-0ed81f530880", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ijh7epp", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ijh7epp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Sorie_K", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1659985011.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wj1cwt", "score": 32, "author_fullname": "t2_5s66k3xc", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "This is an entry in the Collaborative Analysis of the Inflation Reduction Act, where u/xablor, u/_netstack and I all picked a different section of the bill to drill into in depth. We\u2019re posting everything as top levels here so everyone sees them, but later you can also see all of the fleshed out entries together at the bottom of [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative_analysis_of_the_inflation_reduction/). Thanks to u/xablor for coming up with the idea to do this and for setting up the whole collaborative analysis.  My section is taxes.\n\n**PART 1\u2014CORPORATE TAX REFORM**\n\nThe corporate tax in the Inflation Reduction Act announces a new tax of 15% on book income, so your earnings prior to taxes, deductions, etc.  Basically, if the 15% tax on book income is higher than what they a corporation owes on their normal taxes, then that corporation has to add the difference between the two amounts on their tax bill and pay the total sum.  The idea here is to target corporations which are paying little to no taxes because of loopholes.\n\nHowever, this only applies to corporations that have had $1 billion in taxabale income (averaged across the previous three years, unless the company has existed for less than three years, then averaged across however long they have been around).  These corporations can almost be exempt if they are experiencing a change in ownership, or if they had a certain number of (as yet undetermined) consecutive years earning below $1 billion, or if the Secretary of the Treasury feels like it.  Taxes are also levied on global income, so as to account for base erosion, the process of shifting profits from your high tax home country to a subsidiary or parent in a low tax foreign country. This is similar-ish to the way Trump\u2019s Base Erosion and Tax proposal implemented an alternative minimum tax on global income.\n\nFor a [critical perspective](https://taxfoundation.org/inflation-reduction-act/), the conservative Tax Foundation argues \u201cThe proposed 15 percent minimum tax on corporate book income is the most economically damaging provision in the bill, reducing GDP by 0.1 percent and costing about 23,000 jobs\".  Another [article of theirs](https://taxfoundation.org/biden-corporate-income-tax-rate/) gives a good explanation of the problems of taxing book income.  There might be good reasons why taxable income is lower (or higher) than book income, because of depreciation of tangible investments, because of stock options, because of net operating losses being carried forward \u2013 all of which might actually be reasonable and shouldn\u2019t be penalized. The Tax Foundation [offers a more specific breakdown](https://taxfoundation.org/book-minimum-tax-analysis/) of which industries would be affected the most.  Supposedly real estate is number one followed by minining, mostly because they make significant use of depreciation.\n\nAll of this makes sense but again, though, this is only a tax on (certain) corporations making over a billion dollars.  In other words, at its most inefficient this tax will only affect at most 135 of the over 6 million companies registered in the US.  Even if all of their caveats are correct, will the tax really have such wide-ranging distortionary affects for the whole economy when its targeted at such a tiny minority of extremely profitable companies?  Would those negative effects outweigh the $313 billion in new revenue and deficit reduction?\n\nOne reason to justify being a little nervous is that the liberal Tax Policy Center [is also skeptical](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/book-minimum-tax-may-discourage-investment-more-rate-hike) about taxing book income rather just raising the ordinary corporate tax for the same reasons. They also point out that while the tax would only hit 300 companies (double my findings but who\u2019s counting), those companies account for about 60% of all capital so if the tax disincentivizes investment the effects could be large.\n\nHowever, [they take issue](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/putting-jcts-score-inflation-reduction-act-context) with the Tax Foundation's broad analysis and projections of the IRA, arguing that their assessment fails to take into the ameliorative affects of other tax credits.  As for the corporate tax, the point to a substantial body of research indicating that now up to 60% of corporate profits are estimated to be \u201csupernormal,\u201d ie profits beyond what you would normally expect that are made possible by rent seeking, patents, specialized expertise, economies of scale, luck, etc. ([1](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/WP-116.pdf), [2](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.17310/ntj.2016.4.05), [3](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.17310/ntj.2013.1.09) \\- note that the the sources here are the US Treasury ~~and researchers from the famously non-leftist U Chicago~~). As long as the new tax is lower than 100% of excess profit, it shouldn\u2019t really impact investment and hiring, at least according to the [Congressional Research Service](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RL34229.pdf) and my understanding of mainstream thinking on the issue (it\u2019s possible I totally misunderstand this).  Furthermore, they [point to growing evidence](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/rethinking-incidence-corporate-income-tax) that the corporate tax is more progressive than once thought, landing more on the capitalists than on the laborers.\n\nThe Tax Foundation seems to basically agree with this \u2013 they don\u2019t use the most liberal estimates you can find but they assume that 75% of the burden will fall on capitalists and 25% on laborers.  Tax Policy Center counsels further that the \u201claborer\u201d category still hides significant progressivity because significant research ([1](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/rethinking-corporate-income-tax-role-rent-sharing/full), [2](https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/slower-productivity-and-higher-inequality-are-they-related), [3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2586870), [4](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533003769204362)) shows that growing shares of profits are now shared as income with top managers and executives, who are still counted as laborers in this context.  The corollary is that the incidence of the corporate tax that lands on labor is still fairly progressive, landing the highest on these high earners.  For more specific numbers on how this affects the tax incidence you can check these sources ([1](https://ericohrn.sites.grinnell.edu/files/exec_comp/ohrn_tax_breaks_exec_comp_2021_2.pdf), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721002139), [3](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/134/3/1343/5420483?redirectedFrom=fulltext), [4](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24598/w24598.pdf), [5](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/corporate-taxes-and-the-earnings-distribution-effects-of-the-domestic-production-activities-deduction.htm)):\n\n&gt;\u201cA study by Eric Ohrn of Grinnell College shows that the five highest-paid executives at the studied firms reaped between 17 and 25 percent of some recent corporate income tax cuts \u2013 including changes in depreciation rules and subsidies for domestic production.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Economists at the Federal Reserve Board and the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation found the highest-paid 1 percent of employees reaped 40 percent of the benefits of a corporate tax cut. An additional 19 percent of the benefits of that tax cut went to the highest paid 2 percent to 10 percent of employees.\u201d\n\nAfter you adjust for executive compensation being counted in the labor category, and for them bearing a vastly disproportionate amount of labor tax incidence, it upturns the Tax Foundation\u2019s assessment that this would \u201craise taxes on all brackets\u201d and confines the hike to the upper end of the scale.\n\nWhere I think this leaves us is that there\u2019s general agreement that a normal corporate tax raise would be preferable than a book income tax in terms of efficiency and distortion.  However, given that this will target a small number of firms receiving excess profits from rent seeking, it\u2019s hard to say how much this will really impact investment and hiring, if at all, and the tax incidence is almost certain to be progressive and to be born mostly by capitalists and the C suite.\n\nautomod\\_multipart\\_lockme", "edited": 1660013692.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ijh7epp", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an entry in the Collaborative Analysis of the Inflation Reduction Act, where &lt;a href=\"/u/xablor\"&gt;u/xablor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/_netstack\"&gt;u/_netstack&lt;/a&gt; and I all picked a different section of the bill to drill into in depth.

It allows players on both private and Mojang-hosted multiplayer servers to flag inappropriate messages in chat for review by Mojang investigators, potentially resulting in suspensions and bans for players that violate Minecraft's community guidelines even on self-hosted servers. Fans are worried that the system will result in player bans for messages taken out of context, and more broadly that it gives Microsoft too much power to dictate the content of discussions on its platform.\n\nMore details from Mojang (aka Microsoft) [here](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/7317376541197), or a more technical breakdown of an earlier implementation from the weekly builds [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20220630085634/https://blog.bithole.dev/mc-report.html).\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the game's online mode, Minecraft (way back in 2009) originally focused on privately-run servers, and while there's a subscription service for company-run Realms servers (starting in 2013, before the Microsoft buyout), and a small industry of third-party management tools, some [better](https://chs.gg/) and some worse, but either way, the majority of servers are effectively managed by non-Mojang and non-Microsoft employees.  People playing on such machines only interface directly with Microsoft services to login and to download updates (and, uh, for everything in Windows).\n\nMost of these servers are _small_.  It's theoretically possible to run a 'large' server or server cluster -- [HyPixel's count is famously high](https://hypixel.krashnz.com/) -- but this usually involves some combination of throwing obscene amounts of RAM at the problem, using an extremely customized version of the server, and/or [clustering approaches](https://velocitypowered.com/wiki).  For a single dedicated server machine or even mid-end cloud instance, it's very hard to scale past ~200 simultaneous users: modded environments tend to struggle badly in the [~100](https://twitter.com/CuriousCalamari/status/1535364691488395266) users range, and the most recent BlanketCon (a modder convention server focused on a higher-performance culture war split called Quilt that derived from the high-performance internal-frustration split called Fabric) [managed to get a workable server to 170 concurrent players](https://hackmd.io/@LemmaEOF/blanketcon-22-postmortem#Performance-Performance-Performance) by live-patching out stuff like Achievements.  Most servers more likely run 5-40 concurrent players, usually favoring the low end.\n\nRunning a server is balancing act beyond the technical aspects.  Even without mods or PvP, it's trivially easy for a bad actor to grief other players at least some of the time, and even well-meaning players can unintentionally create lag bombs or overflow NBT.  And people are people, for better or worse.  In turn, server operators are dictators by nature; there is little appeal past whoever controls the electrical bill or the file system, and it's historically be constrained to the sort of thing that involve the FBI.\n\nWhich runs into some complications, when you're talking about a game a) is at least somewhat marketed toward kids, b) [that supports chat and a nearly-unfettered voxel sandbox](https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg/status/604411327583375361), c) has or had prominent cultural trends toward [anti-censorship](https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/en).  Not _new_ problems -- kids wandering unobserved into the wrong IRC channel, PHPbb or USENET/BBC are stories nearly as old as the internet themselves, and [inspirations behind federal legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act) older than Java 1.2 -- but ones somewhat more prominent when the majority of the children in the country play the game.So there's [definitely](https://twitter.com/politicalmath/status/1391282599046238208) a [problem](https://twitter.com/mattcarriere/status/1391290583486922757) that this is [pointed](https://twitter.com/gigaherz/status/1553076537179660288) at solving, or at least helping solve.\n\nBut there are some tradeoffs.  There are some technical efforts built into the system to avoid or at least reduce manipulation, but ultimately this is a field where not just one client, but also the server and the other client may be in the hands of the enemy -- early attempts to manipulate it are [allegedly failed](https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1553077938639085568), but I'm somewhat skeptical that it's totally bulletproof and the rapid release of a couple patches hasn't encouraged people.  Even with the system working perfectly at a mechanical and code level, there's also just a more fundamental problem when moderation runs into culture: \"\"Is Queer A Slur\" - the greatest thread in the history of forums, locked by a moderator after 12,239 pages of heated debate,\".    There's also not a lot of trust of Microsoft, here.  The migration from Mojang to Microsoft accounts famously, in the modded community, [booted one Forge dev out for over four months](https://twitter.com/voxcpw/status/1489695958925463555).  Xbox's general moderation capabilities are not exactly held in high regard, either, and it's pretty easy to imagine that the typical server maintainer does a better job.\n\nWorse, there's reason to think it may not stop at this particular limit.  The [ADL](https://www.adl.org/resources/report/breaking-building-blocks-hate-case-study-minecraft-servers) has a oft-linked study on Minecraft moderation on the largest server clusters, and somewhat interestingly there's not very much overlap between what it's worried about, and what the new reporting system focuses on.  That [glassbottommeg](https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg/status/604411327583375361) thread wondering how Minecraft hasn't resulted in a bunch of lawsuits?  It's also about content that isn't reportable, here.  The central example where a server op might be an abuser?  Possibly handled... if the victim realizes it, and reports something that's obvious enough.  It's not clear how well this fixes or even seriously slows the underlying motivations and concerns, in the long run, in short.\n\nWorse, this handles the _difficult_ technical problems: while not a perfect solution to the questions of authenticity of messages only viewed by three untrusted parties, it's a good enough one for Microsoft to have shipped it.  Expanding this system to upload different data, or without user intervention, isn't as simple as a boolean tweak, but it's not deeply complicated.\n\nThat's not to say it _will_ go wrong, or go further.  I'm hope I'm just being paranoid, and outside a small number of cases for stuff that would otherwise end up involving the FBI we never hear about it again.  But that's a hope.\n\nThere's a temptation to label this by the normal Culture War assumptions, where _obviously_ Red Tribers would oppose the new system, and Blue Tribers would support it.  And you can find _some_ of that, whether genuine or primed by the coverage, and whether pogger-faced unverifiable claims on YouTube or hyperbolic comparisons to Gamergate (yes, really) on Discord.\n\nBut there's also people on the Quilt Discord, a place defined in no small part by its Culture War split from a different modloader, pondering about the ramifications when someone reports certain feelings about the international status of Hong Kong.  Or that, given the weaponization of concerns about child abuse applied to even the most of LGBT-related topics, that perhaps this is not a great tool to be passing to the XBox Live Moderation Staff.  Which isn't a _huge_ surprise; I've posted before about tech censorship [aimed at VioletBlue](https://www.reddit.com/r/CultureWarRoundup/comments/b7ycv5/offtopic_and_loweffort_cw_thread_for_the_week_of/ejwyhxf/?context=999) who then used that [as examples of what should be aimed at her _opponents_](https://twitter.com/violetblue/status/1112878491588939776), but it's worth pointing out none-the-less.((And, on the other side, it's not like PoliticalMath is going to share VioletBlue's perspective on what is acceptable discussion matter [when young adults are in the room](https://twitter.com/politicalmath/status/1523840050122870789).  There are people with principles, but you'd give Diogenes a run for his money looking for 'em.))\n\nSo... I dunno.\n\nThe deeper melancholy is more about the general case.  Minecraft hits particularly had because it's Microsoft's Mojang (2 billion served!) on one side and Your Personal Server (2/10 active players) on the other, but that isn't exactly unique.  Everyone knows that anything happening on Discord is between you, everyone else on the server, Discord Inc, and [the inevitable leaks](https://twitter.com/hradzka/status/1116502891689172993), but it's not like the motivations for Minecraft here will care that you're running your own RocketChat or Matrix instance; they're just smaller and haven't gotten the same attention.\n\nFor now.\n\nIt's not like this is new grounds in a framework where private or small-community utterances can end up sliced and diced by faceless team of reviewers by metrics you can't understand or contest.  It's not even particularly extreme as such goes.

Well, if you are to believe that the nordic gender/professional roles distribution is at least closer to the baseline biologically oriented distribution, then what cultural pressures are driving proportionally more developing countries women towards STEM?

Fewer children per family will also mean less chances of having a sibling of the opposite sex.
