['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of July 18, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_w1s5b7", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658124910.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

The officer, armed with a rifle, asked his supervisor for permission to shoot the suspect. However, the supervisor either did not hear or responded too late.\n\nPrior to anyone dying there was an armed police officer on site with a bead on the shooter *after* he had fired on two civilians and into the school from the outside. He did not engage the shooter.\n\n&gt;At 11:35:55, all three Uvalde Police Department (UPD) officers entered the structure through the west door into the west hallway. These officers were equipped with the following: one with external armor and two with concealable body armor, two rifles, and three pistols.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:36:00, four officers entered the south hallway through the south door closest to the suspect. It is not clear what equipment these officers had with them. Four more officers entered the west hallway through the west door at 11:36:03.\n\nWithin three minutes of the shooter entering the building, there were at least *eleven* police officers in the building, all with firearms and vests of some sort. At least two, possibly more, had rifles. They do not engage the shooter.\n\n&gt;At 11:38:37, an officer outside of the hallway advises the suspect \u201cis contained.\u201d (BWC)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:40:58, the suspect fires 1 round according to audio estimates. (ISS)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:41:30, dispatch asked via radio if the door was locked, a UPD officer responds, \u201cI am not  \n&gt;  \n&gt;sure, but we have a hooligan to break it.\u201d (BWC)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:44:00, the suspect fires one more round according to audio estimates. (ISS)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE ASSESSMENT 8  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:48:18, a UCISD PD officer enters through the west hallway door and states, \u201cShe says she is shot,\u201d referring to his wife. He is escorted outside of the building.\n\nDespite being just behind the shooter, who continues to fire intermittently throughout the standoff, the cops hole up and carefully insert their thumbs deep into their collective rectums.\n\n&gt;At 12:06:16, UPD RL notes that no Command Post is set up, advised bodies needed to keep parents out.\n\nNo one is in charge and the only concern of the cops is to keep anyone who might tackle the shooter out of the school, be it their own officer whose wife was at that moment bleeding out mere feet away, or the parents.\n\n&gt;By 12:13:00, dispatchers had received numerous 9-1-1 calls from a child explaining that there were several children and one of her teachers deceased and another teacher hurt in room 112.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 12:15:27, it appears tactical team members of United States Border Patrol Tactical Teams (BORTAC) arrive  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 12:21:08, four shots are fired by the suspect from within one of the two classrooms. (ISS)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;From 12:21:16 until 12:34:38, a continuous conversation takes place in the south hallway,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;involving UCISD PD Chief Arredondo and a UPD officer discussing tactical options and  \n&gt;  \n&gt;considerations including snipers, windows, and how to get into the classroom. They also discussed  \n&gt;  \n&gt;who has the keys, testing keys, the probability of the door being locked, and if kids and teachers  \n&gt;  \n&gt;are dying or dead. (BWC)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;From 12:37:45 until 12:47:25, UCISD PD Chief Arredondo attempts to negotiate with the suspect, speaking in English and Spanish  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 12:50:03, an ad Hoc team assaults room 111, neutralizing the suspect\n\nSo that's the greatest hits of the timeline. To push in on some issues we discussed previously:\n\nWindows:\n\n&gt;The exterior walls of each classroom had two 3\u2019 x 4\u2019 windows near the opposing corners of each classroom (see Figure 3). The bottom of each window was approximately 3\u2019 from interior floor level, and they were equipped with mini blinds. From the exterior, the windows were approximately 4\u2019 from ground level.\n\nSo four windows total covering both classrooms, and at a height that a normal size man would have no trouble seeing/shooting through from the outside.\n\nExternal door:\n\n&gt;on this day the door was not locked, and because it was not locked, the attacker was able to immediately access the building.\n\nInternal door:\n\n&gt;the suspect is seen entering the room, exiting the room, and then reentering the room again prior to officers entering the building at 11:35:55. The only way to engage the lock is to insert a key from the hallway side of the door. At no point is the suspect observed entering the hallway and engaging the locking mechanism. Based upon this, we believe that the lock to room 111 was never engaged.\n\nJesus H. Shitfucking Christ. Then there's this gem:\n\n&gt;As noted in Figure 6, there was a window in the center of each classroom door. Officers could have utilized the window to send accurate return fire back at the suspect.\n\nInitial attempt of the police to enter:\n\n&gt;As the officers approached the doors, the suspect began firing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This gunfire caused both teams of officers to retreat from the doors. We note that the officers did not make contact with the doors (i.e., they never touched any part of the doors)\n\nThis was at the point in time when they had eleven officers with at least two rifles available. Only two officers (one with a rifle) attempted to get to the door, and they both ran away as soon as rounds started coming through the drywall. The \"grazing injuries\" seem to be fragments of the wood/drywall rather than bullets.\n\nSo what should the officers have done, according to the experts?\n\n&gt;Perhaps the simplest plan would have been to push the team back down the hallway and attempt to control the classrooms from the windows in the doors. Any officer wearing rifle rated body armor (e.g., plates) would have assumed the lead as they had an additional level of protection. A team of 4 officers could have utilized the windows in the doors to control a large portion of the classroom from the hallway......  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If the officers believed that they could not establish control through the doors, they should have found another way to stop the killing and dying. One option would have been to breach the exterior windows of the classrooms.....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Both options a and b could have been done simultaneously. The window breaks could have been used to signal the start of the assault and draw the suspect\u2019s attention from the doors. The window officers would stay behind the cover of the exterior wall while the door officers had priority of fire. Then the window officers could stand and cover the rest of the room.\n\nWell fuck me running, what sort of tactical genius would it take to have thought of that?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vb5h8j/culture\\_war\\_roundup\\_for\\_the\\_week\\_of\\_june\\_13\\_2022/iciz2ij/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vb5h8j/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_june_13_2022/iciz2ij/?context=3)", "edited": 1658178702.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_igoxug5", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tactical AAR on the Uvalde school shooting is out, and full of information for those who want to dig in deeper.
