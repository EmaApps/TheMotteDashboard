['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 22, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wulqxp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 40, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 40, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661148908.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

Nothing conclusive, and the police announce that [they don't suspect foul play](https://news.yahoo.com/finnish-police-not-action-against-095348944.html/) related to videos. [Marin took a drug test](https://yle.fi/news/3-12588465), but since it's an urine test and not a hair test, critics claim it proves nothing.\n\n\\- Some major other local discussions: why wasn't Marin [formally on holiday when partying](https://yle.fi/news/3-12583726)? what if the Russians had attacked while she was drunk, or if there had been a crisis equivalent to the [MS Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_MS_Estonia) ship disaster? (Note: Russia has actually sent most of the troops in the Northwestern area to Ukraine, and Finnish crisis laws are written in a way that would nevertheless enable reacting to crises even if she had actually been in complete blackout mode.) Are the celebrities that Marin partied with high-status enough? (They're basically Instagram influencers and pop stars, and 5-10 years younger than 36-year-old Marin)? Is it all just media effort to get clicks and try to demonstrate they're not going easy on Marin for being young and female and leftist?\n\n\\- Marin was also accused of cheating on her husband (and the father of her child) when a [video turned out](https://www.is.fi/politiikka/art-2000009015380.html) where she's dancing with a guy (actually locally quite famous actor/singer Olavi Uusivirta) who is totally trying to get his mack on. I wouldn't say the video shows her cheating, unless she and her husband have agreed the other party can't even dance with the opposite sex. At least as far as I've interpreted it, she's not really responding to her attempts and (I would guess) gently tells him to stop trying at some point. When asked about this video, Marin said that she thought Uusivirta \"was trying to whisper her something\", which is quite silly, but a friend of mine, when we talked about the scandal, said that she probably phrased it that way since if she had said \"Olavi Uusivirta was trying to lick my neck even though I said no\" it would probably have been a career-ender for him, rather than her.\n\n\\- It turns out that two of Marin's celeb friends took a picture of themselves kissing while topless at Marin's official residence in Kes\u00e4ranta, ie. Finland's Downing Street 11. This was widely considered to be inappropiate due to the official status of the location, as well as due to the idea that there might have been state secrets in the apartment. (One columnist even compared it to January 6, lol. If you want evidence about the mental American colonization of European politics...) [Marin promptly apologized](https://yle.fi/news/3-12589779).\n\n\\- There's a ton of news about this in foreign media, which is a huge thing in Finland in itself, since Finland is a country of 5,5 million people and, as such countries often tend to do, is hugely interested in all the cases where it is mentioned outside of its own borders, as [this meme, for instance](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/400x/12412665.jpg), indicates. (I've heard that New Zealanders, for instance, behave the same way). Foreign coverage, like [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/24/finlands-pm-is-a-young-woman-in-power-her-partying-is-the-total-opposite-of-disgrace?CMP=share_btn_fb), seems to range from \"look at this hot PM\" to \"is this a plot by Putin\" to \"haha, it turns out that Finns are stuffy and conservative for hating their PM for dancing\". As I've noted, the actual criticisms aren't really as much about dancing as about the possibility of drug use in her vicinity and about the crises.\n\n\\- [Marin gives a tearful address](https://yle.fi/news/3-12591456) in Social Democratic party meeting, saying \"I am a human being. In the midst of the crisis, I have been thinking about Ukraine and about all of you\" (the [rest of her speech was about Ukraine](https://yle.fi/news/3-12589250) and shows the hardening of opinions in Finland about Russia, it wasn't just a random statement).\n\nI'm guessing that if there's not something new and conclusive turning up, the scandal is going to start dying, but of course something new and conclusive might very well turn up. Finnish social medias have been abuzz with constant suggestions there's new videos moving on around, including one journalist claiming that a video in the \"Thor network\" showing drug use, but this turning out to be a prank.\n\n(edit: edited in a paragraph about the dancing video with Uusivirta)", "edited": 1661451857.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ilr6qag", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culture war in Finland: &lt;strong&gt;Stupidest day in Finnish politics turns into the dumbest week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Finland continues to bask in foreign attention due to the &lt;a href=\"https://alakasa.substack.com/p/the-stupidest-day-in-finnish-politics\"&gt;prime minister&amp;#39;s party scandal&lt;/a&gt;, with PM Sanna Marin currently ranking higher in &lt;a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F12vzpszb7,%2Fm%2F0dl567\"&gt;Google Trends than Taylor Swift.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Developments during the week:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- People continue to analyze the Instagram videos of Marin dancing, finding some indications that there might, indeed, have been drug use, ie. some people can faintly be heard talking in Finnish drug lingo and so on.

([Archive link for NYT](https://archive.ph/TDCP5))\n\n**You can count on journalists to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other options**\n\nYou remember Dan Price. If not by the name, then as the guy who took a big pay cut from his $1.1 million salary to set a minimum wage of $70,000 for employees at his company, Gravity Payments. He did this because he found it unfair to get paid so much. He got a huge amount of publicity from all the usual sources, doing appearances on the *Daily Show* and similar puffery. Rush Limbaugh, on the other hand, called him a socialist, which if Price was scripting this would be exactly what he would have asked for.\n\nThen-at-Bloomberg reporter Karen Weise found out really quick [that there was a lot underneath the surface](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-gravity-ceo-dan-price/). ([Archive link for Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/v0wdA)). Price's brother sued him after the announcement because the brother was so mad about the wage increase, do you remember? Seattle Times and Inc magazine sure do.\n\nAs background, Price claimed his prior salary of $1.1 milion was set by market rates, but just compared to similar businesses and revenues, you would expect something closer to what was a third of his prior salary, so he was not giving up much. When Weise asked him about that in an interview, he changed the subject and ended the interview.\n\nWell, the reality is that his brother Lucas served him with a lawsuit claiming he was being overpaid. And *then* two weeks later Price docked his own pay. To what level? I have not been able to figure that out, but it could have been \"slashed\" from 3x market rate to 2x market rate.\n\nWhen confronted with this:\n\n&gt; In a follow-up interview in mid-November, I pressed Price about the inconsistency. How could what he told me about being served two weeks after announcing the raise be true when the court records indicated otherwise?\n\n&gt; \u201cUmm, I\u2019m not, I have to look,\u201d he said.\n\n&gt; The court document, I said, definitely says March 16.\n\n&gt; \u201cI am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise,\u201d he replied.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe court record shows you being served on March 16\u2009...\u2009at 1:25 p.m.,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd actually, your answer to it was dated April 3,\u201d also before the pay hike.\n\n&gt; \u201cI am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise,\u201d he repeated.\n\n&gt; I asked again how that could be, saying the declaration of service shows Price was served with the complaint, the summons, and other documents, \u201cthat you are a male, who is white, age 30, 5-feet-8-inches, medium height, dark hair.\u201d\n\n&gt; He paused for 20 seconds. \u201cAre you there?\u201d he asked, then twice repeated his statement that he was only aware of the suit being initiated in late April. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to answer any other questions you may have,\u201d he added.\n\nWhat else could conme out? His ex-wife who did a TedX talk at the University of Kentucky where she read from her journal entries from the time she was married. \u201cHe got mad at me for ignoring him and grabbed me and shook me again.\u201d ... \u201cHe also threw me to the ground and got on top of me. He started punching me in the stomach and slapped me across the face. I was shaking so bad.\u201d\n\n\n**\"What are you going to do, cancel me?\" - Man who was cancelled**\n\nWeise relayed these quotes to Price, who said he was not comfortable responding when he had no evidence of such an allegation. He called back three hours later to remember to say that the events never happend.\n\nWeise published her article and everyone who loved being in the room with him ran for the exits. Someone had called the emperor naked, and suddenly there were other things to do.\n\nTaking a page from Bill Clinton, Price told his staff that his ex-wife was nuts and needed to be restrained, but admitted he should not have done that. A year later his staff spontaneously gifted him with a new Tesla because they loved him so much, which was another media set up according to his head of marketing, another employee in marketing, and the young woman who had at the time claimed credit for coming up with the idea. Price gives this recitation of facts the Sharper Image  how-dare-you-say-our-product-is-fake-when-this-hurts-the-feelings-of-our-customers-who-did-not-know-that treatment: \u201cthe idea that some people are trying to soil this cherished memory is deeply hurtful.\u201d He was quickly forgotten again.\n\n**Just tweet through it**\n\nBut Price was determined to get his spotlight back. He set out on a new quest to uncancel himself and hired an ex-Seattle Times reporter to shit out orthodoxy 24/7/365 on all social media channels.\n\nHe got back into the spotlight. Nick Kristof's NYT wrote [a lauditory opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/opinion/sunday/dan-price-minimum-wage.html) ([archive link for NYT](https://archive.ph/c5WU1)). Did it contain anything negative at all? Yes, it admitted there were \"bumps.\" Kristof links to the NYT's old story from when the narrative was that Lucas's lawsuit was in response to the pay policy. Kristof does not correct that narrative but knows better than to repeat it since it has been proven false by court records.\n\n&gt; There were bumps, no doubt about it. A couple of important employees quit, apparently feeling less valued when new hires were close to them in pay. The publicity forced Gravity, which processes credit card payments for small businesses, to hire additional people to handle a deluge of inquiries. Worst of all, Price\u2019s brother, who owned a stake in the company, sued and alleged that Price hadn\u2019t consulted him on decisions.\n\nNothing there is literally incorrect! Publish it! We are in the height of #MeToo but no need to publish accusations from his ex-wife TedX talk.\n\nOh, the ex-wife's TedX talk? Gravity's head of marketing called the University of Kentucky about \"potential defamation lawsuit\" and the university declined to publish it. This was known back in 2016 but no need to bring that up in a 2019 piece. Definitely nothing #MeToo relevant here, nosiree.\n\n**You can count on journalists to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other options and then forgotten the previous narrative and then once again exhausted all other options**\n\nSo Karen Weise writes a new article at NYT (the first link). And it turns out that he has been building up his SEO as the standard male feminist to lure in women. Doug Forbesm, a blogger, had been collecting accounts of women accusing Price for years. No one, including the NYT, wanted to run the story so he blogged them himself. Besides his ex-wife we have:\n\n* Serena Jowers filmed them having sex without her knowledge and three other women say he did the same to them.\n\n* Another described Price having sex without her consent in the middle of the night.\n\n* In a car ride, Shelby Hayne said he grabbed her throat and would not let go, and then drove donuts around a parking lot when he realized he was not getting any.\n\n* Danny Askini said he pushed her against a wall when he did not invite her upstairs after a date.\n\n* Kacie Margis did not know there were any warning signs because they did not come up in Google searches, and ended up in Palm Springs with him. She says she got locked out of their room while wearing a bikini, and later he had sex with her while she was asleep after taking an edible.\n\nThe Hayne incident ended up being investigated by the cops, which is what broke the dam and let everything else finally come out. \n\nHe resigned as CEO so he could devote his energy full time to fighting the false accusations against him. As Karen Weise is writing this article, you can tell she loves rubbing it in the face of media, including the NYT that she is currently writing the article for. And she fucking loves juxtaposing Price's orthodox social media posts with his actual behvavior. Particularly his posts about how easy it is for a man to disprove false allegations. (-\u0361\u00b0-\u035c\u0296-\u0361\u00b0)\u261e\n\nCurrent web searches are all about articles of his resignation so there may not be a third act for him.\n\nThe assault charge got dropped from the Hayne incident, but the cops had a gem they documented:\n\n&gt; According to the police report, Mr. Price boasted that no one had believed Ms. Col\u00f3n\u2019s allegations of abuse \u201cbecause of who he is and that no one would believe her either.\u201d\n\nAfter all, what use is all that cred as a male feminist if you cannot spend it?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ilm1fkk", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ease of orthodoxy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I came across a Paul Graham essay I had missed when it first came out: &lt;a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html\"&gt;http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is good but I want to highlight this paragraph and footnote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the features of a religion.

A couple of important employees quit, apparently feeling less valued when new hires were close to them in pay. The publicity forced Gravity, which processes credit card payments for small businesses, to hire additional people to handle a deluge of inquiries. Worst of all, Price\u2019s brother, who owned a stake in the company, sued and alleged that Price hadn\u2019t consulted him on decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing there is literally incorrect! Publish it! We are in the height of #MeToo but no need to publish accusations from his ex-wife TedX talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, the ex-wife&amp;#39;s TedX talk? Gravity&amp;#39;s head of marketing called the University of Kentucky about &amp;quot;potential defamation lawsuit&amp;quot; and the university declined to publish it. This was known back in 2016 but no need to bring that up in a 2019 piece. Definitely nothing #MeToo relevant here, nosiree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can count on journalists to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other options and then forgotten the previous narrative and then once again exhausted all other options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Karen Weise writes a new article at NYT (the first link). And it turns out that he has been building up his SEO as the standard male feminist to lure in women. Doug Forbesm, a blogger, had been collecting accounts of women accusing Price for years. No one, including the NYT, wanted to run the story so he blogged them himself. Besides his ex-wife we have:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serena Jowers filmed them having sex without her knowledge and three other women say he did the same to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another described Price having sex without her consent in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a car ride, Shelby Hayne said he grabbed her throat and would not let go, and then drove donuts around a parking lot when he realized he was not getting any.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny Askini said he pushed her against a wall when he did not invite her upstairs after a date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kacie Margis did not know there were any warning signs because they did not come up in Google searches, and ended up in Palm Springs with him. She says she got locked out of their room while wearing a bikini, and later he had sex with her while she was asleep after taking an edible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hayne incident ended up being investigated by the cops, which is what broke the dam and let everything else finally come out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He resigned as CEO so he could devote his energy full time to fighting the false accusations against him. As Karen Weise is writing this article, you can tell she loves rubbing it in the face of media, including the NYT that she is currently writing the article for. And she fucking loves juxtaposing Price&amp;#39;s orthodox social media posts with his actual behvavior. Particularly his posts about how easy it is for a man to disprove false allegations. (-\u0361\u00b0-\u035c\u0296-\u0361\u00b0)\u261e&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current web searches are all about articles of his resignation so there may not be a third act for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The assault charge got dropped from the Hayne incident, but the cops had a gem they documented:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to the police report, Mr. Price boasted that no one had believed Ms. Col\u00f3n\u2019s allegations of abuse \u201cbecause of who he is and that no one would believe her either.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all, what use is all that cred as a male feminist if you cannot spend it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilm1fkk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1661358199.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wulqxp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 34}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ill027f", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ill027f", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "JTarrou", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1661342340.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wulqxp", "score": 42, "author_fullname": "t2_b66ibjb", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "In the wake of Bruen (henceforth Bruen1), a suit has again been filed (Antonyuk v.
