['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 15, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wos3do", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1660544108.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

Maybe it's a traffic accident, but then it seems to be [of the explosive kind](https://www.thedailybeast.com/darya-dugina-daughter-of-putin-propagandist-alexander-dugin-killed-in-car-bomb-reports-say).\n\nShe was a member of the \u00abInternational Eurasianist movement\u00bb, with all that entails (e.g a LARPy black robe with a golden Chaos star); she was supporting the \u00abspecial military operation\u00bb, and got added to American and UK sanction lists. But she likely wasn't the target: her father ^1 was expected to be in the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving on Mojaiskoe highway near [Bolshiye Vyazyomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshiye_Vyazyomy) in the Moscow Oblast. They were returning from a certain \u00abTradition\u00bb fest.  \n\nBeing a high-profile Russian Nationalist is a reliable way to cut your life expectancy. Igor Shafarevich had made it to 93, dying in 2017, but he had always been built differently. In the two Covid years preceding the Z day, it's been getting rough. Eduard Limonov: March 2020, 77. Konstantin Krylov died in May 2020, aged 52, from a stroke. Maxim Martsinkevich [got suicided](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/iseo9j/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_september_14/g5n3d1i/) in prison in September 2020; he was 36. [Egor Prosvirnin](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/rphmgp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_december_27/hqq1tfi/), as I've reported before, had flown out of the window and crashed into the asphalt on December 27th, 2021, at 35. Darya was 30.  \nI'm reading another Darya sometimes: Kozeko, Yale-educated, @digitalgonzo96 (account inactive). She comments on boylove fiction and local sushi restaurants, opportunistically wages \u00abinformation warfare\u00bb and complains about shelling noise and water supply breakdowns. She's living in Donetsk. Probably I won't be reading any new Kozeko at some point in the not too distant future.  \n\nAs for Dugina, the obvious suspicion falls on Ukrainian agents, aided by Western intel, or perhaps on their local sympathizers. Ukrainians have demonstrated their capacity to carry out assassinations *on the outskirts of Moscow* [years ago](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2016/09/20/ukrainian-separatist-murdered-in-moscow-restaurant-a55399) \u2013 though Russia pointedly refuses to consider that one politically motivated. \n\nLogically speaking, Galkovsky's family is next. Holmogorov, Krasovsky or Prilepin are more immediately deserving, but they're more directly state-affiliated, and thus presumably harder targets. Maybe Olshansky, Kashin and some other journalists of that sort are on the kill list. ^2\n\nI wonder if they'll come for translators. \n\nMore generally, I think this should be taken as a good message for reactionaries and conservative contrarians everywhere, TradCaths, groypers, alt/dissident-rightists of whatever is the current euphemism; all sorts of political Platonists who think and act as if the world can bend to their mind, like Dugin's sensei and alchemist Golovin taught. A very old-school, Kipling-style message, in the case QANON, Jan 6th and its consequences weren't enough for everybody over there.  \nYou're not playing games when you exercise your wordsmithing ability in public. Be cautious of your wishes coming true. This world is physical and unforgiving, an arena where sober-headed causality engineers wrestle with brute chance, emergent complexity and each other; posing as Gigachads and portraying your better-organized opponents as crying Soyjaks will earn you nothing but misery in the long run. Wars are won not with spirit and meme magic and Idealism but with boring stuff like skills, manpower, logistics and strategy. Including wars of the mind! When you fight a war, even a Culture war, it's obscene to treat it as a game.  \nAlexander Heliyevich Dugin has been playing word games all his life and got lost in their rhizomatic abyss, a perpetually edgy boy with an uncanny and uneven erudition, although adorned with a solid grey beard (by the way, he's only 60 despite his looks, a decade younger than his clean-shaven, botoxed, small-minded God-Czar; this *starchestvo*, performative embrace of the aging process, is a political statement). He has already lost more than his sanity. Most likely it'll be easier for him to spin this loss into another ^3 bitter cause for doubling down than to admit having been fundamentally wrong. Don't be like Alexander Heliyevich Dugin, if you can. The real world deserves being taken seriously.   \n\n---\n\n**1:** To make it clear: I think assassinating Dugin is fair game, though perhaps not worth the effort. He's a warmonger and he considers philosophy to be a form of combat, and the highest form at that. Indeed, the last post on his vk.com account (predating the event by half a day) begins with: \n\n&gt; Mental warfare should be handled by people with a high quality of mentality. That is, above all, philosophers. After all, we are talking about Noomakhia, **wars of the mind**. In my opinion, to put this in the context of the Defense Ministry is grotesque and absurd.  \n\nPhilosophy aside, he has always directly encouraged the violence and, what offends me more, the escapist fantasy of prevailing through the denial of \u00abTitanism\u00bb, even resorting to clear tomfoolery (On the subject of import substitution: \u00abThere will be a lot of products from Belarus. Even more than now. Including textiles and cosmetics. **And also washbasins**. But Belarus will be the State of the Empire\u00bb. What?). Half a year ago, back when I was still [in denial](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/sgv76g/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_january_31/hvqh1kw/) about the impending war, he was clamoring for the ruination of Ukraine, and he deserves his label as the [intellectual father of Russian Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashism#Aleksandr_Dugin). \n\nI used to find those extreme aspects of him clownish, mere delusion of an ideologue who's been used and discarded by a corrupt bureaucratic apparatus he glamorizes. But it turns out that a clown mafia state can still try to act out esoteric fascism. Like they say: \u00abIt looked like we've punched through the rock bottom; then we've heard knocking from below\u00bb. \n\n**2:** Solovyev's death would be satisfying to hear about, but [one alleged attempt](https://meduza.io/feature/2022/06/21/dva-mesyatsa-nazad-fsb-ob-yavila-o-sryve-pokusheniya-na-vladimira-solovieva) had already failed; and I'm afraid he's the type to repent, be graciously forgiven and get his assets back, proceeding to bang empty-headed Russian Studies co-eds and write cringe-inducing lit crit and mawkish memoirs until his centennial anniversary. (Then again, that's what *Westerners* can offer him; Ukrainians are a healthy Eastern European people, somewhat cruder. And they're getting into their \u00abthe only good Russian is a dead Russian\u00bb mindset deep enough to train their pitchforks on [Maxim Katz](https://youtu.be/ZMNIHvuaG8U) now).  \n\n**3:** an excerpt from Dugin's interview in *Moskovsky Komsomolets*, a rather free-wheeling outlet, titled \u00ab\u201cSolar\u201d Putin has defeated \u201cLunar\u201d one\u00bb, Mar 30: \n\n\u2013 Alexander Gellievich, I was rereading one of your interviews about the existence of two Putins. \u00abSolar\u00bb and \u00abLunar.\u00bb \u00abSolar\u00bb is [about] Crymnash (Crimea Ours), the restoration of the Eurasian empire, messianism. \u00abLunar\u00bb is a rational practitioner, a realist, an adherent of capitalist economy, acting with regard to the collective West. At the time, you lamented that Putin just won't commit to the \u00abSolar\u00bb path, preferring to combine both. And how is it today \u2013 has the choice been made?\n\n\u2013 Yes, of course, the \u00abSolar\u00ab Putin has won, and I've been saying that he would win not a year ago, but for many years in a row. I have even published a book about this, \u00abPutin vs Putin\u00bb, dedicated to the main paradox of Russian politics \u2013 it has been translated into many languages and in it I present my theory in detail. \n\nThere is an interesting author in historical science, Ernst Kantorovich, who wrote a study called \u00abThe Two Bodies of the King\u00bb. It is about the fact that any great ruler is always dual. On the one hand, physically, he is certainly a man, and on the other hand, he is a historical figure, part of a continuous historical process. As a man, he can think in a certain way; but as a historical figure on which the fate of peoples and states depend, he may act very differently.  \n\nThis duality creates the deepest tension, the drama of the ruler, and is characteristic of a variety of political regimes. It does not matter whether we are dealing with democracy, as in the case of Churchill or Roosevelt, or with monarchy, as under Ivan the Terrible or Nicholas II. It is a split that arises in the soul and in the heart, in the consciousness of the ruler, when he is truly aware of his responsibility before history, when the future of humanity depends on his actions and his decisions made with reliance on himself and his destiny, on the depths of his \u00abI\u00bb.\n\nAn ordinary, normal person acts rationally, by inertia \u2013 this is what I call the \u00abLunar\u00bb side. He adapts to circumstances and recognizes the rules of the game, follows moral and ethical norms.\n\nThe \u00abSolar\u00bb side, on the other hand, compels him to perform a great deed. In the image of our president this is expressed very vividly.\n\nOn the one hand, Putin is devoted to the sovereignty of Russia as a state, but on the other, rational hand I think he was well aware of the consequences of a persistent insistence on his position. In this respect, Putin's \u00abSolar\u00bb beginning is extremely tragic, because it means struggle with the ideas and values of the West. **But Russia has crossed the Rubicon, which I am personally very happy about.**", "edited": 1661047701.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_il4zgw1", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obituary #3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darya Dugina, the daughter of the philosopher and Culture Warrior &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dugin\"&gt;Alexander Dugin&lt;/a&gt; whom I&amp;#39;ve been sporadically translating here over these years, was killed some hours ago.

They were returning from a certain \u00abTradition\u00bb fest.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a high-profile Russian Nationalist is a reliable way to cut your life expectancy. Igor Shafarevich had made it to 93, dying in 2017, but he had always been built differently. In the two Covid years preceding the Z day, it&amp;#39;s been getting rough. Eduard Limonov: March 2020, 77. Konstantin Krylov died in May 2020, aged 52, from a stroke. Maxim Martsinkevich &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/iseo9j/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_september_14/g5n3d1i/\"&gt;got suicided&lt;/a&gt; in prison in September 2020; he was 36. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/rphmgp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_december_27/hqq1tfi/\"&gt;Egor Prosvirnin&lt;/a&gt;, as I&amp;#39;ve reported before, had flown out of the window and crashed into the asphalt on December 27th, 2021, at 35. Darya was 30.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;m reading another Darya sometimes: Kozeko, Yale-educated, @digitalgonzo96 (account inactive). She comments on boylove fiction and local sushi restaurants, opportunistically wages \u00abinformation warfare\u00bb and complains about shelling noise and water supply breakdowns. She&amp;#39;s living in Donetsk. Probably I won&amp;#39;t be reading any new Kozeko at some point in the not too distant future.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for Dugina, the obvious suspicion falls on Ukrainian agents, aided by Western intel, or perhaps on their local sympathizers. Ukrainians have demonstrated their capacity to carry out assassinations &lt;em&gt;on the outskirts of Moscow&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2016/09/20/ukrainian-separatist-murdered-in-moscow-restaurant-a55399\"&gt;years ago&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 though Russia pointedly refuses to consider that one politically motivated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Logically speaking, Galkovsky&amp;#39;s family is next. Holmogorov, Krasovsky or Prilepin are more immediately deserving, but they&amp;#39;re more directly state-affiliated, and thus presumably harder targets. Maybe Olshansky, Kashin and some other journalists of that sort are on the kill list. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they&amp;#39;ll come for translators. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More generally, I think this should be taken as a good message for reactionaries and conservative contrarians everywhere, TradCaths, groypers, alt/dissident-rightists of whatever is the current euphemism; all sorts of political Platonists who think and act as if the world can bend to their mind, like Dugin&amp;#39;s sensei and alchemist Golovin taught. A very old-school, Kipling-style message, in the case QANON, Jan 6th and its consequences weren&amp;#39;t enough for everybody over there.&lt;br/&gt;\nYou&amp;#39;re not playing games when you exercise your wordsmithing ability in public. Be cautious of your wishes coming true. This world is physical and unforgiving, an arena where sober-headed causality engineers wrestle with brute chance, emergent complexity and each other; posing as Gigachads and portraying your better-organized opponents as crying Soyjaks will earn you nothing but misery in the long run. Wars are won not with spirit and meme magic and Idealism but with boring stuff like skills, manpower, logistics and strategy. Including wars of the mind! When you fight a war, even a Culture war, it&amp;#39;s obscene to treat it as a game.&lt;br/&gt;\nAlexander Heliyevich Dugin has been playing word games all his life and got lost in their rhizomatic abyss, a perpetually edgy boy with an uncanny and uneven erudition, although adorned with a solid grey beard (by the way, he&amp;#39;s only 60 despite his looks, a decade younger than his clean-shaven, botoxed, small-minded God-Czar; this &lt;em&gt;starchestvo&lt;/em&gt;, performative embrace of the aging process, is a political statement). He has already lost more than his sanity. Most likely it&amp;#39;ll be easier for him to spin this loss into another &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bitter cause for doubling down than to admit having been fundamentally wrong. Don&amp;#39;t be like Alexander Heliyevich Dugin, if you can. The real world deserves being taken seriously.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:&lt;/strong&gt; To make it clear: I think assassinating Dugin is fair game, though perhaps not worth the effort. He&amp;#39;s a warmonger and he considers philosophy to be a form of combat, and the highest form at that. Indeed, the last post on his vk.com account (predating the event by half a day) begins with: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mental warfare should be handled by people with a high quality of mentality. That is, above all, philosophers. After all, we are talking about Noomakhia, &lt;strong&gt;wars of the mind&lt;/strong&gt;.

It's clear to me that there are people who *like AI*, and there are people who *don't like AI*.  That is, regardless of your object-level beliefs about the inevitability of the development of the technology, or how many jobs it will displace, or what potential benefits it may bring to society and culture at large, people tend to enter the debate with a preexisting positive or negative emotional affect towards the concept of AI itself.  Some people are happy that the technology exists; some are not.\n\nWhat causes someone to join one group or the other?  What sorts of underlying beliefs and values are at play here?  What patterns can we observe?\n\nTo make things clear up front, I *don't like* AI, and I especially don't like AI art, so part of the analysis will inevitably take place from that point of view, although I ultimately hope to touch on the underlying psychological motivations of both groups.\n\nLet's dispose of some of the simple and obvious explanations first: the idea, for example, that the only people worried about AI art are artists who are afraid of losing their jobs, and any other sane person should be happy to reap the rewards of increasingly democratized access to the means of cultural production.  I can't object to this idea from an *entirely* neutral point of view, since drawing and painting are more tied to my identity than they are for the average person, but I can still object to it from a semi-objective point of view.  I have no musical ability whatsoever, nor do I have any interest in ever developing any, but I still don't like AI music.  I'm pretty sure it's been years at this point since I first heard about AI composing pieces in the style of Bach and Beethoven, and I didn't like that stuff when I first heard about it either.  It rubs me the wrong way.\n\nNor can opposition to AI be reduced to simple technological luddism, or a knee-jerk preference for what is familiar over what is new and unfamiliar.  I am not opposed to all technological progress on principle - I welcome the advent of interstellar travel, and the curing of diseases like cancer and ALS.  Conversely, I am skeptical of technologies that have been a familiar part of my life since childhood.  I can hardly remember a time when I didn't have access to the internet, and yet my feelings towards it are mixed at best.  It's a double edged sword - it has brought many great things, but also many terrible things.  If I could somehow freeze publicly-available internet access at a level of development comparable to the late 90s, I probably would.  But that's another story.\n\nIt's not hard to enumerate factors that I *incidentally* find distasteful about AI art - that it will flood the world with a glut of low-effort content, that it will inflate the egos of people who think they are \"artists\" when they are in fact nothing of the sort, that it will discourage people from developing genuine creativity because it will be easier to settle for a half-hearted, inauthentic substitute - but I think that none of these considerations truly strike at the heart of the issue for me.  My intuition is that there is something deeper going on, something that can be related to the culture war, because I think I can see familiar patterns from the culture war repeating themselves.\n\nMy highly speculative thesis is that people who like AI are motivated by an *aesthetics of success*, and people who don't like AI are motivated by an *aesthetics of failure*, or a tragic aesthetics.  These positions also correspond in a very loose way to the left/right divide, respectively.  I'll try to explain what I mean.\n\nTraditionally, leftism since Marx was founded in a belief in utopian progress - that we could resolve social problems through willful, rational action, ultimately culminating in a terminal optimal social order that was free of contradictions, or as Marx put it, \"the riddle of history solved\".  Now, it's possible to claim that modern (or even classic) leftism is not about this at all, and that it's actually a thinly disguised form of ethnic warfare.  That may be true.  But even so, you can't deny that this utopian impulse did exist in and continues to inform leftism, and more importantly, people who *enjoy* this vision of the future, people who find it *aesthetically* pleasing, people who hear the idea of an optimal non-contradictory social order and think \"hey that sounds like a good idea\", tend to be drawn to leftism.\n\nThe same utopian impulse from Marxism also underlies the transhumanism of, for example, Yudkowsky's [Fun Theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K4aGvLnHvYgX9pZHS/the-fun-theory-sequence).  The idea (as far as I can tell from lightly skimming it) is that we could construct a perfect reality that satisfies every constraint we could ever wish to optimize for - it's exactly as exciting as we need, exactly as pleasant as we need, exactly as challenging as we need, and if for some reason you wish to meet a tragic end where you fail to fulfill all your goals, well hey we can arrange for that too.  It is logically perfect in every way - no one is excluded, no one could ask for more, even the people whose very wish is to be excluded from the utopia.  I think the relation between this kind of transhumanism on the one hand, and the development of AI on the other, is pretty obvious - if you enjoy, on an aesthetic level, the idea of a perfect transhumanist future, then you probably also enjoy on an aesthetic level when AI smashes through fundamental human limitations.\n\nI am *in no way* saying that everyone who gets warm fuzzies for AI and transhumanism is a leftist.  Certainly we have many counterexamples on this forum.  Nor does every leftist like the idea of AI - there are plenty of leftist artists complaining on twitter about AI art as we speak.  But I do think that leftists and people who like AI are aligned on this general pro-utopian axis - they agree that a utopian future is fundamentally desirable, even if they disagree on implementation details, and many other contemporary political issues besides.\n\nThe key thing to understand about the other side, the opposition to this utopian ideal, is that *not everyone thinks that utopia is desirable*.  Some of us consciously reject it.  I mean this in a very deep way, as deep as you can possibly conceive.  I mean that even in the most logically perfect utopia you can imagine, one where everyone gets the exact amount of challenge and pain and tragedy that is suited to them, one where I can live in my tragic broken reality and you can live in your blissful nice one and we can somehow coexist simultaneously - *I still don't want that*.  I don't want reality to be like that.  I don't want reality to be at peace.  I want there to be failure in the very nature of things.  I want us to never reach a final state of peace, even if there is fire and brimstone built into that overarching peace.\n\nFrom Zizek's \"Less Than Nothing\":\n\n&gt;It is true that one finds in Hegel a systematic drive to cover everything, to propose an account of all phenomena in the universe in their essential structure; but this drive does not mean that Hegel strives to locate every phenomenon within a harmonious global edifice; on the contrary, the point of dialectical analysis is to demonstrate how every phenomenon, everything that happens, fails in its own way, implies a crack, antagonism, imbalance, in its very heart.  Hegel's gaze upon reality is that of a Roentgen apparatus which sees in everything that is alive the traces of its future death.\n\nI find this to be an immensely aesthetically pleasing passage - it's how I want reality to be.  I imagine that transhumanists will not feel as warmly towards it (although this is an empirical hypothesis that is subject to refutation through counterexamples).  To you, there is beauty in triumph; problems are meant to be solved, and then quietly and safely set aside, conquered, dealt with.  You want to [resolve on the I chord](https://youtu.be/6aezSL_GvZA?t=430).  We won, you say; there's no need to go backwards now.  Man stands victorious at the summit of his knowledge.  You thought we couldn't make a machine that paints beautiful pictures?  Well, we did it.  We put the sum total of man's visual knowledge into a machine.  That's what we were able to accomplish; our triumph over this domain is total.  The beauty of our actions is measured by the strength of the gods we have slain.\n\nTo me, there is beauty in failure - no problem ever fully solved, no debate ever put to rest, no point of finality ever reached.  Not because there is an angry God who will slap us down if we exceed our station, but because *failure is built into the very nature of things*.  The moment of triumph becomes the moment of defeat, not due to any external force, but because of the necessity of its own inner movement.  Reality as a demonic house of mirrors where every moment of recognition is the moment of misrecognition, every realization comes too late that the act of will was actually the ultimate act of self-sabotage - this is reality as I *aesthetically* want it to be.  Doesn't mean it is.  But it's what I want - it's what I like.  And our likes and dislikes are awfully important when it comes to motivating our actions.\n\nHopefully there's something here to discuss.\n\n&gt;Out of love for mankind...

The idea (as far as I can tell from lightly skimming it) is that we could construct a perfect reality that satisfies every constraint we could ever wish to optimize for - it&amp;#39;s exactly as exciting as we need, exactly as pleasant as we need, exactly as challenging as we need, and if for some reason you wish to meet a tragic end where you fail to fulfill all your goals, well hey we can arrange for that too.  It is logically perfect in every way - no one is excluded, no one could ask for more, even the people whose very wish is to be excluded from the utopia.  I think the relation between this kind of transhumanism on the one hand, and the development of AI on the other, is pretty obvious - if you enjoy, on an aesthetic level, the idea of a perfect transhumanist future, then you probably also enjoy on an aesthetic level when AI smashes through fundamental human limitations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;in no way&lt;/em&gt; saying that everyone who gets warm fuzzies for AI and transhumanism is a leftist.  Certainly we have many counterexamples on this forum.  Nor does every leftist like the idea of AI - there are plenty of leftist artists complaining on twitter about AI art as we speak.  But I do think that leftists and people who like AI are aligned on this general pro-utopian axis - they agree that a utopian future is fundamentally desirable, even if they disagree on implementation details, and many other contemporary political issues besides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key thing to understand about the other side, the opposition to this utopian ideal, is that &lt;em&gt;not everyone thinks that utopia is desirable&lt;/em&gt;.  Some of us consciously reject it.  I mean this in a very deep way, as deep as you can possibly conceive.  I mean that even in the most logically perfect utopia you can imagine, one where everyone gets the exact amount of challenge and pain and tragedy that is suited to them, one where I can live in my tragic broken reality and you can live in your blissful nice one and we can somehow coexist simultaneously - &lt;em&gt;I still don&amp;#39;t want that&lt;/em&gt;.  I don&amp;#39;t want reality to be like that.  I don&amp;#39;t want reality to be at peace.  I want there to be failure in the very nature of things.  I want us to never reach a final state of peace, even if there is fire and brimstone built into that overarching peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From Zizek&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Less Than Nothing&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is true that one finds in Hegel a systematic drive to cover everything, to propose an account of all phenomena in the universe in their essential structure; but this drive does not mean that Hegel strives to locate every phenomenon within a harmonious global edifice; on the contrary, the point of dialectical analysis is to demonstrate how every phenomenon, everything that happens, fails in its own way, implies a crack, antagonism, imbalance, in its very heart.  Hegel&amp;#39;s gaze upon reality is that of a Roentgen apparatus which sees in everything that is alive the traces of its future death.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find this to be an immensely aesthetically pleasing passage - it&amp;#39;s how I want reality to be.  I imagine that transhumanists will not feel as warmly towards it (although this is an empirical hypothesis that is subject to refutation through counterexamples).  To you, there is beauty in triumph; problems are meant to be solved, and then quietly and safely set aside, conquered, dealt with.  You want to &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/6aezSL_GvZA?t=430\"&gt;resolve on the I chord&lt;/a&gt;.  We won, you say; there&amp;#39;s no need to go backwards now.  Man stands victorious at the summit of his knowledge.  You thought we couldn&amp;#39;t make a machine that paints beautiful pictures?  Well, we did it.  We put the sum total of man&amp;#39;s visual knowledge into a machine.  That&amp;#39;s what we were able to accomplish; our triumph over this domain is total.  The beauty of our actions is measured by the strength of the gods we have slain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, there is beauty in failure - no problem ever fully solved, no debate ever put to rest, no point of finality ever reached.  Not because there is an angry God who will slap us down if we exceed our station, but because &lt;em&gt;failure is built into the very nature of things&lt;/em&gt;.  The moment of triumph becomes the moment of defeat, not due to any external force, but because of the necessity of its own inner movement.  Reality as a demonic house of mirrors where every moment of recognition is the moment of misrecognition, every realization comes too late that the act of will was actually the ultimate act of self-sabotage - this is reality as I &lt;em&gt;aesthetically&lt;/em&gt; want it to be.  Doesn&amp;#39;t mean it is.  But it&amp;#39;s what I want - it&amp;#39;s what I like.  And our likes and dislikes are awfully important when it comes to motivating our actions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully there&amp;#39;s something here to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Out of love for mankind... I conceived it as my task to create difficulties everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kierkegaard&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikva0zo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1660867979.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wos3do", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ikv9b16", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ikv9b16", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "thejawaknight", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660867656.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wos3do", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yrat8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "https://youtu.be/JrCmrMnJUIc\n\nI was listening to a podcast which interviewed a parent about social emotional learning in their school.

Of course it's not a new thing for Finnish politicians to use alcohol or even get into accidents and such while doing so, but this is the new era and everyone has smartphones.\n\nPreviously the [major affair was in December](https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-finlands-prime-minister-sanna-marin-apologises-for-going-clubbing-after-coronavirus-exposure-12490903), when she was out late in a Helsinki club even though she had been exposed to Covid and there were still Covid restrictions for various things; even though the restrictions didn't affect what she, specifically, was doing, it was considered improper. On these evenings she's been spotted with an entourage of local pop stars and other celebs.\n\nAnyway, last week, she was at one of the major music festivals in Finland, Flow Festival - not the biggest, but a classic hipster festival and certainly \"upscale\" - and had pics taken [with the attending celebs](https://is.mediadelivery.fi/img/468/7089604209104a472752cf1aa503aeb2.jpg). This caused some tut-tutting about behaving immaturely during great crises in Europe and the world. Whatever.\n\nNow it turns out that one of the members of her entourage took a [video of being a drunk party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C-djV-ptEM) with her entourage and posted it on IG - private account for 92 people, to be sure, but of course something like that's going to get out. The video started spreading yesterday, and the entirety of today has consisted on Finnish social and traditional media obsessing about the clip, specifically about the specific charges of whether her entourage uses cocaine.\n\nOf course PM partying in an entourage that's on drugs would be scandal in other countries, too, whether they took coke personally or not, but Finland tends to currently be particularly conservative on drugs compared to other Western countries - even pot decriminalization is not really soemthing that most would be consider to be short-term achievable.\n\nHard drugs are, of course a whole other question. I haven't used anything stronger than pot in my life and it's been years since I've even smoked, but my understanding is that coke has been a facet of celebrity life at some level. However, it's only recent years when it has really hit the scene in Helsinki. Usually, the hard drug of choice for Finns has been speed.\n\nNow, none of the celebrities are actually snorting anything up their nose in the video, so what's the evidence for drug use? Well, apart from the fact that they're, ya know, smiling and having fun and so on in the video (Finns might drink alcohol, but we do it to get drunk, not to actually have fun), at some parts of the video, some of them shout \"Fuck it, this makes me feel good\" in reference to something unseen and the word that might be \"jauhojengi\" (\"flour gang\") or something else. Also, some claim that some of the pixels in the video indeed make it look like there's coke on the table. (Others claim it's a phone.) One particular claim is even that people on the video must be on drugs since there are so few bottles or glasses seen.\n\n\"Flour gang\" has instantly became a meme here, even though it's now unclear 1. whether \"flour\" is actually Finnish drug lingo, or whether it has ever been used to refer to powder drugs here by anyone and 2. whether the words \"jauhojengi\" are actually used - the video features people dancing to and singing washed-up pop rapper Petri Nyg\u00e5rd's lyrics for the old hit song \"Selv\u00e4 p\u00e4iv\u00e4\" (\"Sober day\"), which is about, as you might guess, drinking. (You can find [translated lyrics](https://lyricstranslate.com/en/selv%C3%A4-p%C3%A4iv%C3%A4-sober1-day.html) here if you really wish.) The word heard as \"jauho\" might well instead be a reference to \"jallu\", or Jaloviina, an iconic Finnish booze brand that's 50 % brandy and 50 % vodka and features in a metric ton of local music.\n\nSeveral medias took the whole \"flour gang\" thing and ran with it, probably one reason being that earlier in the week they were criticized for going too easy on Marin and her government. Now others are attacking media for pushing a theory originally spread (at least on Twitter) by conspiracy theorist accounts that have otherwise taken a pro-Russian narratie. Yes, there are even references to whole thing being a Russian disinfo campaign.\n\nMarin has herself [had to comment on this](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-finnish-pm-sanna-marin-says-no-drugs-just-lots-of-dancing-at-wild/), saying that she is disappointed in the video leaking, that she only had mild alcoholic drinks and doesn't use drugs and that she's willing to even take a drug test (not that it would show cocaine use anyway, more than a few days having passed from the party). Of course it still might turn out one or more of the celeb entourage members have been on drugs, who knows?\n\nAll in all, it would probably be the best if the PM quit back on partying or at least chose better friends to avoid embarassing stuff leaking out (also, you know, for general security reasons), the first rule of the Flour Gang is to never talk about the Flour Gang, PMs should find better music to dance to than a local whiteboy 50 Cent and politics here can indeed be as dumb as anywhere else, especially with the social media and stuff.", "edited": 1660835634.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ikswpuv", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture war in Finland: Stupidest day in Finnish politics for a long time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CONTEXT: It&amp;#39;s not a new thing that Finnish PM Sanna Marin, 36, has been frequently seen out and about, drinking and dancing in clubs and such.
