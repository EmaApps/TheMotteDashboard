There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh).

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of July 18, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_w1s5b7", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658124910.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

This bill basically sets out a list of reasons why abortions may not be restricted and creates a test for what future reasons will be prohibited by the law. It targets pretty directly laws various Republican states passed when *Roe* was still in effect to limit abortion. It empowers both the US Attorney General and private parties (including those seeking abortions and those providing them) to sue to enforce the law.\n\nThe second of these is the [Ensuring Women\u2019s Right to Reproductive Freedom Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8297/text?r=1&amp;s=1). This law creates liability (enforced by either the Attorney General or private citizens) for anyone acting under color of State law who tries to prevent someone from traveling interstate for the purpose of getting an abortion that would be legal in the state they are going to have it done in.\n\nBoth bills passed the House with all but one Democrat in favor and all Republicans against.\n\nBoth bills are most likely dead on arrival in the Senate.\n\n---\n\nOn Tuesday the House of Representatives also passed the [Respect For Marriage Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8404/text) which enshrines, not [*Obergefell v. Hodges*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) but rather [*United States v. Windsor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor) into federal law. The law does not require that states perform either same sex or interracial marriages but it does require they recognize those marriages if performed in other states where they are legal. It is also enforceable by either the Attorney General or a private right of action. The law also clarifies that the federal definition of marriage includes both interracial and same sex marriages.\n\nInterestingly 47 Republicans (~one-fourth of the caucus) joined the Democrats in passing the bill. If a similar fraction of Senate Republicans support the bill that would be sufficient to invoke cloture and pass it.\n\n---\n\nFinally, introduced today by a bipartisan group of Senators (but not passed anywhere) is the [Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/electoral_count_reform_and_presidential_transition_improvement_act_of_2022.pdf). Exploitation of some ambiguity in the 12th amendment and Electoral Count Act (USC 3) were key to John Eastman's plan for Trump to retain the presidency even after losing the 2020 election. This act is an attempt to remove that ambiguity. The Act does so first by clarifying that state electors are determined by the laws of the state *prior to election day*. This is to prevent state legislatures from changing who the electors are after the vote has happened (unless they delegated themselves that power in advance). The Act also raises the threshold necessary to trigger a vote on an objection from one Senator and one Representative to one-fifth of Senators and Representatives. It also clarifies the grounds on which electors may be objected to. Finally it clarifies that the role of the President of the Senate is ministerial only and sets up an expedited legal process (three judge panel, then SCOTUS) for hearing challenges to election certification.", "edited": 1658351494.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_igyr7zl", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about a post on some recent Congressional legislation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The House of Representatives has now passed two bills aimed at protecting abortion rights. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first is the &lt;a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3755/text\"&gt;Women&amp;#39;s Health Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;.

It empowers both the US Attorney General and private parties (including those seeking abortions and those providing them) to sue to enforce the law.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second of these is the &lt;a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8297/text?r=1&amp;amp;s=1\"&gt;Ensuring Women\u2019s Right to Reproductive Freedom Act&lt;/a&gt;. This law creates liability (enforced by either the Attorney General or private citizens) for anyone acting under color of State law who tries to prevent someone from traveling interstate for the purpose of getting an abortion that would be legal in the state they are going to have it done in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both bills passed the House with all but one Democrat in favor and all Republicans against.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both bills are most likely dead on arrival in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday the House of Representatives also passed the &lt;a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8404/text\"&gt;Respect For Marriage Act&lt;/a&gt; which enshrines, not &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obergefell v. Hodges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but rather &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States v. Windsor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into federal law. The law does not require that states perform either same sex or interracial marriages but it does require they recognize those marriages if performed in other states where they are legal. It is also enforceable by either the Attorney General or a private right of action. The law also clarifies that the federal definition of marriage includes both interracial and same sex marriages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly 47 Republicans (~one-fourth of the caucus) joined the Democrats in passing the bill. If a similar fraction of Senate Republicans support the bill that would be sufficient to invoke cloture and pass it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, introduced today by a bipartisan group of Senators (but not passed anywhere) is the &lt;a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/electoral_count_reform_and_presidential_transition_improvement_act_of_2022.pdf\"&gt;Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Exploitation of some ambiguity in the 12th amendment and Electoral Count Act (USC 3) were key to John Eastman&amp;#39;s plan for Trump to retain the presidency even after losing the 2020 election. This act is an attempt to remove that ambiguity. The Act does so first by clarifying that state electors are determined by the laws of the state &lt;em&gt;prior to election day&lt;/em&gt;. This is to prevent state legislatures from changing who the electors are after the vote has happened (unless they delegated themselves that power in advance). The Act also raises the threshold necessary to trigger a vote on an objection from one Senator and one Representative to one-fifth of Senators and Representatives. It also clarifies the grounds on which electors may be objected to. Finally it clarifies that the role of the President of the Senate is ministerial only and sets up an expedited legal process (three judge panel, then SCOTUS) for hearing challenges to election certification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igyr7zl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1658350215.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_w1s5b7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": "991bceb0-301f-11e9-a749-0ed81f530880", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_igy93di", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "igy93di", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "DinoInNameOnly", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1658342658.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_w1s5b7", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_13ryno", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Merriam-Webster recently updated the definition of the word \"female\": The first one:\n\n&gt;of, relating to, or being the sex that typically has the capacity to bear young or produce eggs\n\nThe second one is different:\n\n&gt;having a gender identity that is the opposite of male\n\nThe definitions for male are similar.

And will continue to do so. \n\n\nRecently there was a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/ifl02lf/) talking about how; now that covid restrictions are mostly done with; covid is not something most people really think or talk about. But, there are still two groups of people who continue to talk about covid. Those who were really scared and still are, and the \"skeptics\". The post somewhat implied that both groups are extremist in some way or the other on the issue of covid. \n\nI will try to defend my case on why I think my position of being a skeptic should have been the default position. And the fact it wasn't requires some heavy investigation as to why.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nAs a \"covid skeptic\" much of the discourse around covid restrictions makes me feel like I am being 'gaslighted' on a grand level. The jist of it being that I operated under one overton window, one epistemology my entire life and both those things get radically shifted and transformed in 2 years and everyone is suddenly on board, and I am the crazy one for asking \"wait what about everything we knew before?\"? \n\nTo put it shortly there have been shifts on multiple overton windows in ways that are not conductive to a epistemologycally and politically healthy society and somebody has to acknowledge and speak about it. And continue speaking about it, because some of these shifts pave the way for tremendous injustices. \n\nHere are the reasons why I will keep talking about covid for the rest of my life. And I will not be convinced I am crazy or of a certain ideological group because I do so. I believe the ones who are not talking about these things have had the cloak successfully put over their eyes (even if they are otherwise skeptics), they forgave what was done to them after it wasn't being done anymore, they are complacent.\n\n1. Being a \"covid skeptic\" is the default position of almost all societies before 2020. It was the medical consensus that;\n * Lockdowns are not worth it (QALY,$, \"human rights\" ) for the vast majority of diseases. The ones that pose an IFR high enough to justify them are not that scary because they also tend to be non contagious for various reasons. \nWhat was  essentially considered putting entire cities or countries of people under house arrest suddenly became the default mode of addressing the problem? \n * Universal masking is ineffective for airborne diseases.\n * Vaccinating the entire population by threatening the loss of education/work is by the State is overstepping the bounds by any reasonable western State. \n\n The first two points are correct. They were reached after decades of \"good science\". The bullshit ideological science (along with all sorts of publication bias and a thousand other traps) peddled to make it seem that lockdowns are worth it and masks work are the work of pure propaganda. We can't just let that slide right?

And will continue to do so.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently there was a &lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/ifl02lf/\"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; talking about how; now that covid restrictions are mostly done with; covid is not something most people really think or talk about. But, there are still two groups of people who continue to talk about covid. Those who were really scared and still are, and the &amp;quot;skeptics&amp;quot;. The post somewhat implied that both groups are extremist in some way or the other on the issue of covid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will try to defend my case on why I think my position of being a skeptic should have been the default position. And the fact it wasn&amp;#39;t requires some heavy investigation as to why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a &amp;quot;covid skeptic&amp;quot; much of the discourse around covid restrictions makes me feel like I am being &amp;#39;gaslighted&amp;#39; on a grand level. The jist of it being that I operated under one overton window, one epistemology my entire life and both those things get radically shifted and transformed in 2 years and everyone is suddenly on board, and I am the crazy one for asking &amp;quot;wait what about everything we knew before?&amp;quot;? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To put it shortly there have been shifts on multiple overton windows in ways that are not conductive to a epistemologycally and politically healthy society and somebody has to acknowledge and speak about it. And continue speaking about it, because some of these shifts pave the way for tremendous injustices. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are the reasons why I will keep talking about covid for the rest of my life. And I will not be convinced I am crazy or of a certain ideological group because I do so. I believe the ones who are not talking about these things have had the cloak successfully put over their eyes (even if they are otherwise skeptics), they forgave what was done to them after it wasn&amp;#39;t being done anymore, they are complacent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a &amp;quot;covid skeptic&amp;quot; is the default position of almost all societies before 2020. It was the medical consensus that;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lockdowns are not worth it (QALY,$, &amp;quot;human rights&amp;quot; ) for the vast majority of diseases. The ones that pose an IFR high enough to justify them are not that scary because they also tend to be non contagious for various reasons. \nWhat was  essentially considered putting entire cities or countries of people under house arrest suddenly became the default mode of addressing the problem? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Universal masking is ineffective for airborne diseases.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vaccinating the entire population by threatening the loss of education/work is by the State is overstepping the bounds by any reasonable western State. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first two points are correct. They were reached after decades of &amp;quot;good science&amp;quot;. The bullshit ideological science (along with all sorts of publication bias and a thousand other traps) peddled to make it seem that lockdowns are worth it and masks work are the work of pure propaganda. We can&amp;#39;t just let that slide right?

So naturally, when I heard about [a new study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\\(22\\)00847-9/fulltext) out on the impact of alcohol on health and read a couple [news articles](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/14/alcohol-is-never-good-for-people-under-40-global-study-finds) on it, my first instinct was to be similarly scathing regarding the quality of evidence and the reporting thereof. Instead of that though, I want to step back and try to tease apart just how different it is to evaluate that evidence from a public health lens and a personal advice lens. For the moment, let's assume that the quality of data and imputed causal relationships are basically valid and use them as a jumping off point:\n\n&gt;The study, published in the Lancet, found that 59% of those who drank harmful amounts were aged 15-39 \u2013 people for whom alcohol provided no health benefit and posed risks, including injuries relating to drinking or car accidents, suicides or murders.\n\nI probably do buy that straightaway - I would bet a fair bit that drinkers are more likely to be in car accidents, commit murder, or kill themselves. From a public health perspective, this is at least suggestive of a plausible causal relationship, even if it doesn't really provide the necessary evidence to legitimize compulsory policies without randomized control trials to accumulate better evidence going forward. \n\nOn the flip side though, should this tell me, a guy in my thirties that probably does drink a bit too much, much of anything about the likely impact on my longevity? Does it make me more inclined to suggest to friends that they cut back or stop drinking altogether? My immediate inclination is to think that my risk of car accidents, suicides, and murders are changed by a rounding error by drinking, even by drinking heavily - I don't drink and drive, I've never had a remotely suicidal impulse, and I'm a pretty non-violent guy that doesn't carry a weapon. *Maybe* there's some marginal change, but it's not much. What about my advice for others? Well, I suppose I can't know their inner state as well - some people are visibly sullen or violent when drinking, so it might be best for them to knock it off. I have no way to weight the benefits for others accurately, but I personally gain quite a bit of joy from the culture and experience of good beers and bourbons and do not suffer any apparent emotional or material impacts on my life.\n\nThis isn't really about alcohol though (although I do invite commentary on that), it's about how the reactions of public health people. The policy people say things like:\n\n&gt;Dr Richard Piper, chief executive of Alcohol Change UK, said: \u201cThe emerging science on alcohol, over hundreds of studies over the past 20 years, is telling us very clearly that alcohol is very damaging to the human body in multiple ways. We were previously unaware of this, and too many of us continue to drink as though this revolution in our knowledge hasn\u2019t happened.\n\n&gt;\u201cIf you care about your health, by far the best approach is not to drink at all. If you do choose to drink alcohol, listen properly to the UK\u2019s chief medical officers, and do not exceed 14 units a week (about six pints of lager or a bottle and a half of wine), have at least three alcohol-free days a week, and never exceed more than six units in one day.\u201d\n\nThe closing paragraph of the linked Lancet study includes:\n\n&gt;The findings of this study support the development of tailored guidelines and recommendations on alcohol consumption by age and across regions and highlight that existing low consumption thresholds are too high for younger populations in all regions.

They generally can't afford to undercut their message by hedging and saying, \"well, ya know, unless you're just not going to kill yourself, then it doesn't matter much\".\n\nAs a final thought, it's still worth taking a swipe at the journalists - \"Alcohol is never good for people under 40, global study finds\" is just an absolutely shit summary of the finding.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_igtkil9", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of Covid-era public health policies, one of my hobbyhorses has been beating up on public health agencies, supporting bureaucracies, and related research and being even more scathing when it comes to the science reporting targeted at general audiences. So naturally, when I heard about &lt;a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00847-9/fulltext\"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; out on the impact of alcohol on health and read a couple &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/14/alcohol-is-never-good-for-people-under-40-global-study-finds\"&gt;news articles&lt;/a&gt; on it, my first instinct was to be similarly scathing regarding the quality of evidence and the reporting thereof. Instead of that though, I want to step back and try to tease apart just how different it is to evaluate that evidence from a public health lens and a personal advice lens. For the moment, let&amp;#39;s assume that the quality of data and imputed causal relationships are basically valid and use them as a jumping off point:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the Lancet, found that 59% of those who drank harmful amounts were aged 15-39 \u2013 people for whom alcohol provided no health benefit and posed risks, including injuries relating to drinking or car accidents, suicides or murders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I probably do buy that straightaway - I would bet a fair bit that drinkers are more likely to be in car accidents, commit murder, or kill themselves. From a public health perspective, this is at least suggestive of a plausible causal relationship, even if it doesn&amp;#39;t really provide the necessary evidence to legitimize compulsory policies without randomized control trials to accumulate better evidence going forward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the flip side though, should this tell me, a guy in my thirties that probably does drink a bit too much, much of anything about the likely impact on my longevity? Does it make me more inclined to suggest to friends that they cut back or stop drinking altogether? My immediate inclination is to think that my risk of car accidents, suicides, and murders are changed by a rounding error by drinking, even by drinking heavily - I don&amp;#39;t drink and drive, I&amp;#39;ve never had a remotely suicidal impulse, and I&amp;#39;m a pretty non-violent guy that doesn&amp;#39;t carry a weapon. &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; there&amp;#39;s some marginal change, but it&amp;#39;s not much. What about my advice for others? Well, I suppose I can&amp;#39;t know their inner state as well - some people are visibly sullen or violent when drinking, so it might be best for them to knock it off. I have no way to weight the benefits for others accurately, but I personally gain quite a bit of joy from the culture and experience of good beers and bourbons and do not suffer any apparent emotional or material impacts on my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t really about alcohol though (although I do invite commentary on that), it&amp;#39;s about how the reactions of public health people. The policy people say things like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr Richard Piper, chief executive of Alcohol Change UK, said: \u201cThe emerging science on alcohol, over hundreds of studies over the past 20 years, is telling us very clearly that alcohol is very damaging to the human body in multiple ways. We were previously unaware of this, and too many of us continue to drink as though this revolution in our knowledge hasn\u2019t happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf you care about your health, by far the best approach is not to drink at all. If you do choose to drink alcohol, listen properly to the UK\u2019s chief medical officers, and do not exceed 14 units a week (about six pints of lager or a bottle and a half of wine), have at least three alcohol-free days a week, and never exceed more than six units in one day.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The closing paragraph of the linked Lancet study includes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study support the development of tailored guidelines and recommendations on alcohol consumption by age and across regions and highlight that existing low consumption thresholds are too high for younger populations in all regions. Additionally, our results suggest that guidelines should not incorporate sex-specific recommendations, given the absence of variation in TMREL and NDE by sex across geographies and locations. Finally, recognising that the majority of the world&amp;#39;s population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol are young adults and predominantly young males, in order to minimise health loss due to alcohol consumption it is important to prioritise interventions targeted at these demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing about public health is that it&amp;#39;s inherently a fairly blunt instrument.

It just seems odd to me that this kind of thing would come to be associated with \u201cguys who can\u2019t get laid\u201d, especially since it seems like misogyny/sexism is also somewhat associated with the jock/frat bro stereotype. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to argue whether any of this is good or true or sexist or not.

Nothing from the decriminalization of sodomy, to desegregation, to women&amp;#39;s suffrage, to universal &lt;em&gt;male&lt;/em&gt; suffrage, to the abolition of slavery (that one necessitated a military defeat, and even then the rebels were whining that they were only fighting this war because the damned abolitionist fanatics had pushed them to it) has been gotten through except by the defeat of the right, whether that be economic, political, social, or military defeat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, there are committed reactionaries who will happily admit that they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think the decriminalization of homosexuality, women&amp;#39;s suffrage, abolition of slavery, democracy, republicanism, etc. were indeed mistakes, and none of this applies to them, they are at least honest and consistent)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When rightists, historically, has said, &amp;quot;okay, I&amp;#39;ll grant you this one,&amp;quot; they&amp;#39;ve never said it out of magnanimous good-faith, they&amp;#39;ve said it at bayonet-point (literal or metaphorical), when they had &lt;em&gt;no choice&lt;/em&gt; but to grant it anyways. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea that the right wouldn&amp;#39;t be so angry and would have been happy if we hadn&amp;#39;t just kept pushing has always been nonsense, and the right has never been a hapless victim, but rather an enemy on the back foot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any leftist or liberal who is tempted to buy this rightist line of &amp;quot;hey, we would have been glad to meet in the middle, you guys just got so &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; and to see the right as victim rather than a (temporarily) weakened foe ought to remember that old fable about the farmgirl and the wounded serpent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": "comment score below threshold", "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igph8wf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1658186446.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_w1s5b7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 1, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": -12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_igoxug5", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "igoxug5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "JTarrou", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1658178356.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_w1s5b7", "score": 50, "author_fullname": "t2_b66ibjb", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "The tactical AAR on the Uvalde school shooting is out, and full of information for those who want to dig in deeper.

The officer, armed with a rifle, asked his supervisor for permission to shoot the suspect. However, the supervisor either did not hear or responded too late.\n\nPrior to anyone dying there was an armed police officer on site ~~with a bead on the shooter~~ *after* he had fired on two civilians and into the school from the outside. He did not engage the shooter. Edit: or maybe not, conflicting testimony, see thread below.\n\n&gt;At 11:35:55, all three Uvalde Police Department (UPD) officers entered the structure through the west door into the west hallway. These officers were equipped with the following: one with external armor and two with concealable body armor, two rifles, and three pistols.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:36:00, four officers entered the south hallway through the south door closest to the suspect. It is not clear what equipment these officers had with them. Four more officers entered the west hallway through the west door at 11:36:03.\n\nWithin three minutes of the shooter entering the building, there were at least *eleven* police officers in the building, all with firearms and vests of some sort. At least two, possibly more, had rifles. They do not engage the shooter.\n\n&gt;At 11:38:37, an officer outside of the hallway advises the suspect \u201cis contained.\u201d (BWC)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:40:58, the suspect fires 1 round according to audio estimates. (ISS)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:41:30, dispatch asked via radio if the door was locked, a UPD officer responds, \u201cI am not  \n&gt;  \n&gt;sure, but we have a hooligan to break it.\u201d (BWC)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:44:00, the suspect fires one more round according to audio estimates. (ISS)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE ASSESSMENT 8  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:48:18, a UCISD PD officer enters through the west hallway door and states, \u201cShe says she is shot,\u201d referring to his wife. He is escorted outside of the building.\n\nDespite being just behind the shooter, who continues to fire intermittently throughout the standoff, the cops hole up and carefully insert their thumbs deep into their collective rectums.\n\n&gt;At 12:06:16, UPD RL notes that no Command Post is set up, advised bodies needed to keep parents out.\n\nNo one is in charge and the only concern of the cops is to keep anyone who might tackle the shooter out of the school, be it their own officer whose wife was at that moment bleeding out mere feet away, or the parents.\n\n&gt;By 12:13:00, dispatchers had received numerous 9-1-1 calls from a child explaining that there were several children and one of her teachers deceased and another teacher hurt in room 112.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 12:15:27, it appears tactical team members of United States Border Patrol Tactical Teams (BORTAC) arrive  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 12:21:08, four shots are fired by the suspect from within one of the two classrooms. (ISS)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;From 12:21:16 until 12:34:38, a continuous conversation takes place in the south hallway,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;involving UCISD PD Chief Arredondo and a UPD officer discussing tactical options and  \n&gt;  \n&gt;considerations including snipers, windows, and how to get into the classroom. They also discussed  \n&gt;  \n&gt;who has the keys, testing keys, the probability of the door being locked, and if kids and teachers  \n&gt;  \n&gt;are dying or dead. (BWC)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;From 12:37:45 until 12:47:25, UCISD PD Chief Arredondo attempts to negotiate with the suspect, speaking in English and Spanish  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 12:50:03, an ad Hoc team assaults room 111, neutralizing the suspect\n\nSo that's the greatest hits of the timeline. To push in on some issues we discussed previously:\n\nWindows:\n\n&gt;The exterior walls of each classroom had two 3\u2019 x 4\u2019 windows near the opposing corners of each classroom (see Figure 3). The bottom of each window was approximately 3\u2019 from interior floor level, and they were equipped with mini blinds. From the exterior, the windows were approximately 4\u2019 from ground level.\n\nSo four windows total covering both classrooms, and at a height that a normal size man would have no trouble seeing/shooting through from the outside.\n\nExternal door:\n\n&gt;on this day the door was not locked, and because it was not locked, the attacker was able to immediately access the building.\n\nInternal door:\n\n&gt;the suspect is seen entering the room, exiting the room, and then reentering the room again prior to officers entering the building at 11:35:55. The only way to engage the lock is to insert a key from the hallway side of the door. At no point is the suspect observed entering the hallway and engaging the locking mechanism. Based upon this, we believe that the lock to room 111 was never engaged.\n\nJesus H. Shitfucking Christ. Then there's this gem:\n\n&gt;As noted in Figure 6, there was a window in the center of each classroom door. Officers could have utilized the window to send accurate return fire back at the suspect.\n\nInitial attempt of the police to enter:\n\n&gt;As the officers approached the doors, the suspect began firing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This gunfire caused both teams of officers to retreat from the doors. We note that the officers did not make contact with the doors (i.e., they never touched any part of the doors)\n\nThis was at the point in time when they had eleven officers with at least two rifles available. Only two officers (one with a rifle) attempted to get to the door, and they both ran away as soon as rounds started coming through the drywall. The \"grazing injuries\" seem to be fragments of the wood/drywall rather than bullets.\n\nSo what should the officers have done, according to the experts?\n\n&gt;Perhaps the simplest plan would have been to push the team back down the hallway and attempt to control the classrooms from the windows in the doors. Any officer wearing rifle rated body armor (e.g., plates) would have assumed the lead as they had an additional level of protection. A team of 4 officers could have utilized the windows in the doors to control a large portion of the classroom from the hallway......  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If the officers believed that they could not establish control through the doors, they should have found another way to stop the killing and dying. One option would have been to breach the exterior windows of the classrooms.....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Both options a and b could have been done simultaneously. The window breaks could have been used to signal the start of the assault and draw the suspect\u2019s attention from the doors. The window officers would stay behind the cover of the exterior wall while the door officers had priority of fire. Then the window officers could stand and cover the rest of the room.\n\nWell fuck me running, what sort of tactical genius would it take to have thought of that?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vb5h8j/culture\\_war\\_roundup\\_for\\_the\\_week\\_of\\_june\\_13\\_2022/iciz2ij/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vb5h8j/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_june_13_2022/iciz2ij/?context=3)", "edited": 1658326965.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_igoxug5", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tactical AAR on the Uvalde school shooting is out, and full of information for those who want to dig in deeper.
