['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 15, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wos3do", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1660544108.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

It\u2019s possible someone whose ancestors are all imbecilic failures, and who lives in a community of imbecilic failures, will prove as capable (in whatever respect) as someone whose ancestors are all intelligent, competent persons, but it is unlikely enough that no resources or energy should be expended on giving that former someone \u201chis shot.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect this line of thinking viscerally would disgust and upset even a lot of people who consider themselves \u201cright-wing.\u201d I submit that this merely shows the extent to which even self-considered conservatives or reactionaries have been mind-colonized by leftism in the present day.

Most Democrats have welcomed it as gratification long delayed, Trump loyalists have condemned it as a \u201cDeep State\u201d abuse of power, and more measured Republicans have split the difference.

But it mostly stopped there, as the Oklahoma bombing had a chilling effect that delegitimized political violence among the mainstream right.

In the 1990s, the militia movement was merely percolating, committed to resisting government but not interested in taking the offensive or prepared to do so. Mainstream American liberals and conservatives both firmly considered domestic political violence unacceptable. Only conspicuous law-enforcement debacles could inspire even an extremist like McVeigh to lethal terrorist action against fellow Americans. Today, though, Blue and Red are arguably irreconcilable, and Trump has hauled the far right to the surface and enlisted it in his personal service. Some of his supporters are so convinced that his presidency was stolen from him that they apprehend the subdued, circumspect, non-violent execution of a search warrant on his residence as a casus belli, and authoritative and admired figures encourage them to do so.\n\n&gt;Steve Bannon labeled the FBI a \u201cgestapo.\u201d Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene called for Congress to defund the FBI.

Last weekend, armed Trump supporters clad in body armor held a protest outside the FBI\u2019s Phoenix office. Threats against federal law enforcement have spiked, intensifying a growing trend. Some extremists have \u201cdoxxed\u201d FBI agents, publicizing their personal information to enable others to harass them or target them with violence. Such behavior seems intended to mobilize those of McVeigh\u2019s ilk.\n\nThe growth of militias has further catalyzed this process. In the 90s militias were atomized, but with the advent of social media they've been able to talk and coordinate with each other much more effectively. They've stockpiled more weapons as well, with lax gun laws in red states. Departments like the ATF have responded in turn, buying up military-grade gear to turn previously routine operations into SWAT-style force protection. There's also concerns within the ATF and FBI that many agents are sympathetic to the plight of the far right, and there's anecdotal evidence that there were tensions within the FBI due to the Mar-a-Lago raid.

In 1969, the British government sent troops to Northern Ireland to quell growing community unrest over Catholic nationalist political and civil rights protests. The soldiers were initially welcomed as peacekeepers. But as grievances could not be immediately addressed and protests escalated, the British government resorted to more extreme measures, including direct armed confrontation, mass internment of those suspected of paramilitary activities, the statutory establishment of \u201cscheduled offenses\u201d for political violence, and the creation of dedicated, non-jury courts for trying those charged with them. The IRA exploited this too, orchestrating marches and demonstrations that would prompt the Royal Ulster Constabulary to break out the riot gear, which served to confirm their narrative of state oppression, generate sympathetic headlines and news spots, and win recruits to the armed struggle. Eventually, the public came to see IRA militants as soldiers in a civil war.

It's clear to me that there are people who *like AI*, and there are people who *don't like AI*.  That is, regardless of your object-level beliefs about the inevitability of the development of the technology, or how many jobs it will displace, or what potential benefits it may bring to society and culture at large, people tend to enter the debate with a preexisting positive or negative emotional affect towards the concept of AI itself.  Some people are happy that the technology exists; some are not.\n\nWhat causes someone to join one group or the other?  What sorts of underlying beliefs and values are at play here?  What patterns can we observe?\n\nTo make things clear up front, I *don't like* AI, and I especially don't like AI art, so part of the analysis will inevitably take place from that point of view, although I ultimately hope to touch on the underlying psychological motivations of both groups.\n\nLet's dispose of some of the simple and obvious explanations first: the idea, for example, that the only people worried about AI art are artists who are afraid of losing their jobs, and any other sane person should be happy to reap the rewards of increasingly democratized access to the means of cultural production.  I can't object to this idea from an *entirely* neutral point of view, since drawing and painting are more tied to my identity than they are for the average person, but I can still object to it from a semi-objective point of view.  I have no musical ability whatsoever, nor do I have any interest in ever developing any, but I still don't like AI music.  I'm pretty sure it's been years at this point since I first heard about AI composing pieces in the style of Bach and Beethoven, and I didn't like that stuff when I first heard about it either.  It rubs me the wrong way.\n\nNor can opposition to AI be reduced to simple technological luddism, or a knee-jerk preference for what is familiar over what is new and unfamiliar.  I am not opposed to all technological progress on principle - I welcome the advent of interstellar travel, and the curing of diseases like cancer and ALS.  Conversely, I am skeptical of technologies that have been a familiar part of my life since childhood.  I can hardly remember a time when I didn't have access to the internet, and yet my feelings towards it are mixed at best.  It's a double edged sword - it has brought many great things, but also many terrible things.  If I could somehow freeze publicly-available internet access at a level of development comparable to the late 90s, I probably would.  But that's another story.\n\nIt's not hard to enumerate factors that I *incidentally* find distasteful about AI art - that it will flood the world with a glut of low-effort content, that it will inflate the egos of people who think they are \"artists\" when they are in fact nothing of the sort, that it will discourage people from developing genuine creativity because it will be easier to settle for a half-hearted, inauthentic substitute - but I think that none of these considerations truly strike at the heart of the issue for me.  My intuition is that there is something deeper going on, something that can be related to the culture war, because I think I can see familiar patterns from the culture war repeating themselves.\n\nMy highly speculative thesis is that people who like AI are motivated by an *aesthetics of success*, and people who don't like AI are motivated by an *aesthetics of failure*, or a tragic aesthetics.  These positions also correspond in a very loose way to the left/right divide, respectively.  I'll try to explain what I mean.\n\nTraditionally, leftism since Marx was founded in a belief in utopian progress - that we could resolve social problems through willful, rational action, ultimately culminating in a terminal optimal social order that was free of contradictions, or as Marx put it, \"the riddle of history solved\".  Now, it's possible to claim that modern (or even classic) leftism is not about this at all, and that it's actually a thinly disguised form of ethnic warfare.  That may be true.  But even so, you can't deny that this utopian impulse did exist in and continues to inform leftism, and more importantly, people who *enjoy* this vision of the future, people who find it *aesthetically* pleasing, people who hear the idea of an optimal non-contradictory social order and think \"hey that sounds like a good idea\", tend to be drawn to leftism.\n\nThe same utopian impulse from Marxism also underlies the transhumanism of, for example, Yudkowsky's [Fun Theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K4aGvLnHvYgX9pZHS/the-fun-theory-sequence).  The idea (as far as I can tell from lightly skimming it) is that we could construct a perfect reality that satisfies every constraint we could ever wish to optimize for - it's exactly as exciting as we need, exactly as pleasant as we need, exactly as challenging as we need, and if for some reason you wish to meet a tragic end where you fail to fulfill all your goals, well hey we can arrange for that too.  It is logically perfect in every way - no one is excluded, no one could ask for more, even the people whose very wish is to be excluded from the utopia.  I think the relation between this kind of transhumanism on the one hand, and the development of AI on the other, is pretty obvious - if you enjoy, on an aesthetic level, the idea of a perfect transhumanist future, then you probably also enjoy on an aesthetic level when AI smashes through fundamental human limitations.\n\nI am *in no way* saying that everyone who gets warm fuzzies for AI and transhumanism is a leftist.  Certainly we have many counterexamples on this forum.  Nor does every leftist like the idea of AI - there are plenty of leftist artists complaining on twitter about AI art as we speak.  But I do think that leftists and people who like AI are aligned on this general pro-utopian axis - they agree that a utopian future is fundamentally desirable, even if they disagree on implementation details, and many other contemporary political issues besides.\n\nThe key thing to understand about the other side, the opposition to this utopian ideal, is that *not everyone thinks that utopia is desirable*.  Some of us consciously reject it.  I mean this in a very deep way, as deep as you can possibly conceive.  I mean that even in the most logically perfect utopia you can imagine, one where everyone gets the exact amount of challenge and pain and tragedy that is suited to them, one where I can live in my tragic broken reality and you can live in your blissful nice one and we can somehow coexist simultaneously - *I still don't want that*.  I don't want reality to be like that.  I don't want reality to be at peace.  I want there to be failure in the very nature of things.  I want us to never reach a final state of peace, even if there is fire and brimstone built into that overarching peace.\n\nFrom Zizek's \"Less Than Nothing\":\n\n&gt;It is true that one finds in Hegel a systematic drive to cover everything, to propose an account of all phenomena in the universe in their essential structure; but this drive does not mean that Hegel strives to locate every phenomenon within a harmonious global edifice; on the contrary, the point of dialectical analysis is to demonstrate how every phenomenon, everything that happens, fails in its own way, implies a crack, antagonism, imbalance, in its very heart.  Hegel's gaze upon reality is that of a Roentgen apparatus which sees in everything that is alive the traces of its future death.\n\nI find this to be an immensely aesthetically pleasing passage - it's how I want reality to be.  I imagine that transhumanists will not feel as warmly towards it (although this is an empirical hypothesis that is subject to refutation through counterexamples).  To you, there is beauty in triumph; problems are meant to be solved, and then quietly and safely set aside, conquered, dealt with.  You want to [resolve on the I chord](https://youtu.be/6aezSL_GvZA?t=430).  We won, you say; there's no need to go backwards now.  Man stands victorious at the summit of his knowledge.  You thought we couldn't make a machine that paints beautiful pictures?  Well, we did it.  We put the sum total of man's visual knowledge into a machine.  That's what we were able to accomplish; our triumph over this domain is total.  The beauty of our actions is measured by the strength of the gods we have slain.\n\nTo me, there is beauty in failure - no problem ever fully solved, no debate ever put to rest, no point of finality ever reached.  Not because there is an angry God who will slap us down if we exceed our station, but because *failure is built into the very nature of things*.  The moment of triumph becomes the moment of defeat, not due to any external force, but because of the necessity of its own inner movement.  Reality as a demonic house of mirrors where every moment of recognition is the moment of misrecognition, every realization comes too late that the act of will was actually the ultimate act of self-sabotage - this is reality as I *aesthetically* want it to be.  Doesn't mean it is.  But it's what I want - it's what I like.  And our likes and dislikes are awfully important when it comes to motivating our actions.\n\nHopefully there's something here to discuss.\n\n&gt;Out of love for mankind...

Of course it's not a new thing for Finnish politicians to use alcohol or even get into accidents and such while doing so, but this is the new era and everyone has smartphones.\n\nPreviously the [major affair was in December](https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-finlands-prime-minister-sanna-marin-apologises-for-going-clubbing-after-coronavirus-exposure-12490903), when she was out late in a Helsinki club even though she had been exposed to Covid and there were still Covid restrictions for various things; even though the restrictions didn't affect what she, specifically, was doing, it was considered improper. On these evenings she's been spotted with an entourage of local pop stars and other celebs.\n\nAnyway, last week, she was at one of the major music festivals in Finland, Flow Festival - not the biggest, but a classic hipster festival and certainly \"upscale\" - and had pics taken [with the attending celebs](https://is.mediadelivery.fi/img/468/7089604209104a472752cf1aa503aeb2.jpg). This caused some tut-tutting about behaving immaturely during great crises in Europe and the world. Whatever.\n\nNow it turns out that one of the members of her entourage took a [video of being a drunk party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C-djV-ptEM) with her entourage and posted it on IG - private account for 92 people, to be sure, but of course something like that's going to get out. The video started spreading yesterday, and the entirety of today has consisted on Finnish social and traditional media obsessing about the clip, specifically about the specific charges of whether her entourage uses cocaine.\n\nOf course PM partying in an entourage that's on drugs would be scandal in other countries, too, whether they took coke personally or not, but Finland tends to currently be particularly conservative on drugs compared to other Western countries - even pot decriminalization is not really soemthing that most would be consider to be short-term achievable.\n\nHard drugs are, of course a whole other question. I haven't used anything stronger than pot in my life and it's been years since I've even smoked, but my understanding is that coke has been a facet of celebrity life at some level. However, it's only recent years when it has really hit the scene in Helsinki. Usually, the hard drug of choice for Finns has been speed.\n\nNow, none of the celebrities are actually snorting anything up their nose in the video, so what's the evidence for drug use? Well, apart from the fact that they're, ya know, smiling and having fun and so on in the video (Finns might drink alcohol, but we do it to get drunk, not to actually have fun), at some parts of the video, some of them shout \"Fuck it, this makes me feel good\" in reference to something unseen and the word that might be \"jauhojengi\" (\"flour gang\") or something else. Also, some claim that some of the pixels in the video indeed make it look like there's coke on the table. (Others claim it's a phone.) One particular claim is even that people on the video must be on drugs since there are so few bottles or glasses seen.\n\n\"Flour gang\" has instantly became a meme here, even though it's now unclear 1. whether \"flour\" is actually Finnish drug lingo, or whether it has ever been used to refer to powder drugs here by anyone and 2. whether the words \"jauhojengi\" are actually used - the video features people dancing to and singing washed-up pop rapper Petri Nyg\u00e5rd's lyrics for the old hit song \"Selv\u00e4 p\u00e4iv\u00e4\" (\"Sober day\"), which is about, as you might guess, drinking. (You can find [translated lyrics](https://lyricstranslate.com/en/selv%C3%A4-p%C3%A4iv%C3%A4-sober1-day.html) here if you really wish.) The word heard as \"jauho\" might well instead be a reference to \"jallu\", or Jaloviina, an iconic Finnish booze brand that's 50 % brandy and 50 % vodka and features in a metric ton of local music.\n\nSeveral medias took the whole \"flour gang\" thing and ran with it, probably one reason being that earlier in the week they were criticized for going too easy on Marin and her government. Now others are attacking media for pushing a theory originally spread (at least on Twitter) by conspiracy theorist accounts that have otherwise taken a pro-Russian narratie. Yes, there are even references to whole thing being a Russian disinfo campaign.\n\nMarin has herself [had to comment on this](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-finnish-pm-sanna-marin-says-no-drugs-just-lots-of-dancing-at-wild/), saying that she is disappointed in the video leaking, that she only had mild alcoholic drinks and doesn't use drugs and that she's willing to even take a drug test (not that it would show cocaine use anyway, more than a few days having passed from the party). Of course it still might turn out one or more of the celeb entourage members have been on drugs, who knows?\n\nAll in all, it would probably be the best if the PM quit back on partying or at least chose better friends to avoid embarassing stuff leaking out (also, you know, for general security reasons), the first rule of the Flour Gang is to never talk about the Flour Gang, PMs should find better music to dance to than a local whiteboy 50 Cent and politics here can indeed be as dumb as anywhere else, especially with the social media and stuff.", "edited": 1660835634.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ikswpuv", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture war in Finland: Stupidest day in Finnish politics for a long time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CONTEXT: It&amp;#39;s not a new thing that Finnish PM Sanna Marin, 36, has been frequently seen out and about, drinking and dancing in clubs and such.

One particular claim is even that people on the video must be on drugs since there are so few bottles or glasses seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Flour gang&amp;quot; has instantly became a meme here, even though it&amp;#39;s now unclear 1. whether &amp;quot;flour&amp;quot; is actually Finnish drug lingo, or whether it has ever been used to refer to powder drugs here by anyone and 2. whether the words &amp;quot;jauhojengi&amp;quot; are actually used - the video features people dancing to and singing washed-up pop rapper Petri Nyg\u00e5rd&amp;#39;s lyrics for the old hit song &amp;quot;Selv\u00e4 p\u00e4iv\u00e4&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Sober day&amp;quot;), which is about, as you might guess, drinking. (You can find &lt;a href=\"https://lyricstranslate.com/en/selv%C3%A4-p%C3%A4iv%C3%A4-sober1-day.html\"&gt;translated lyrics&lt;/a&gt; here if you really wish.) The word heard as &amp;quot;jauho&amp;quot; might well instead be a reference to &amp;quot;jallu&amp;quot;, or Jaloviina, an iconic Finnish booze brand that&amp;#39;s 50 % brandy and 50 % vodka and features in a metric ton of local music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several medias took the whole &amp;quot;flour gang&amp;quot; thing and ran with it, probably one reason being that earlier in the week they were criticized for going too easy on Marin and her government. Now others are attacking media for pushing a theory originally spread (at least on Twitter) by conspiracy theorist accounts that have otherwise taken a pro-Russian narratie. Yes, there are even references to whole thing being a Russian disinfo campaign.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marin has herself &lt;a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-finnish-pm-sanna-marin-says-no-drugs-just-lots-of-dancing-at-wild/\"&gt;had to comment on this&lt;/a&gt;, saying that she is disappointed in the video leaking, that she only had mild alcoholic drinks and doesn&amp;#39;t use drugs and that she&amp;#39;s willing to even take a drug test (not that it would show cocaine use anyway, more than a few days having passed from the party). Of course it still might turn out one or more of the celeb entourage members have been on drugs, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, it would probably be the best if the PM quit back on partying or at least chose better friends to avoid embarassing stuff leaking out (also, you know, for general security reasons), the first rule of the Flour Gang is to never talk about the Flour Gang, PMs should find better music to dance to than a local whiteboy 50 Cent and politics here can indeed be as dumb as anywhere else, especially with the social media and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikswpuv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1660834414.0, "author_flair_text": "Chief Suomiposter", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wos3do", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 38}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_iksffji", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iksffji", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Eetan", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660827125.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wos3do", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_12nu3f", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Would it be good idea to have regular \"practical life advice\" thread like \"wellness wendesday\" is for health and fitness?\n\n\nThread dedicated to questions about education, jobs, money, \"what gizmo should I buy\" \"my gizmo broke, how to fix it\" and any other real life problems you can imagine.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iksffji", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it be good idea to have regular &amp;quot;practical life advice&amp;quot;

I think there's starting to be a recognition that the fervor and policies born in 2020 were fairly flawed, as evidenced by the legacy of ideas like defund the police, and elections in fairly left areas in which people rejected the progressive candidates in places like NYC, NJ, VA, and SF (the [SF one](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/chesa-boudin-recall-san-francisco-crime/629907/) in particular is interesting. Chesa Boudin really served as a microcosm of progressivism who was given free reign, as were the city council elections that took place around the same time, thus his election served to some extent as a referendum on progressivism).\n\nBut what's interesting is that progressives, in self reflecting and having to analyze why this has occurred, have blamed progressive white people. And to a considerable degree the same thing has been occurring with respect to the policies corporations instituted during 2020. Which is so crazy to me. On the one hand, I agree and find overeducated white progressives who come from wealthy families to be among the most insufferable demographics. But on the other, their only real crime is that they listened to what was being demanded of them, that they be allies and use their supposed privilege to advance the views of anti-racists. It's kind of like they're being told \"Lol you thought we were serious with all of that stuff? What the fuck is wrong with you?\" It sort of validates the view that anti-racists have anti-white undercurrents. Like if they did unambiguously have anti-white undercurrents, how would they respond to the recognition of the ideological excesses of 2020? They would blame white people. Like if you\u2019re a white progressive and want to support movements and ideas like that, at this point I don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re supposed to do. If you don\u2019t support it you\u2019re part of the problem as identified by people you agree with, and if you do support it you\u2019re going to be the scape goat when shit goes south and it becomes clear that the policies you supported to advance the ends you were told to advance were deeply flawed.\n\nI think it also reveals a lack of strategy on the part of people working to advance those ideas, even within their own paradigm. Their view is that white people wield disproportionately more institutional power than non-white people do, so if that\u2019s true you would want those people with outsized power and who agree with you to use that power to advance your ends. But instead they are condemning them and de-incentivizing their participation. It just seems very counterintuitive.\n\nI think it really comes down to the fact that activists are insatiable. when they\u2019re actually given the reins, asked what exactly they want, and allowed to implement policies, they don\u2019t actually know. or if they do have proposals it's always impractically radical stuff that only makes sense to the small group of people who agree with them like just razing institutions and starting over or defunding the police or something equally as bizzare. it reminds me a lot of the occupy wall street people. They\u2019re the dog that caught the car. They aren\u2019t there to actually catch the car, they\u2019re there to chase the car. implementing the change that they desire requires an understanding of things as they are (you have to understand the problem before you can develop a solution), but activists\u2019 characteristic commitment to ideology precludes them from interpreting the world or developing solutions that go even a bit outside the scope of their ideology. Like can anyone seriously envision a series of events and policies that would have caused BLM to be like 'welp. that's pretty much what we were asking for. you did it and solved the problem. guess we can just pack up our shit and go home.' like even over the course of their ideas being implemented over 10 years I can't envision that occurring. \n\nProgressive activists are the dog that caught the car, and once they caught the car and fucked it away they blamed it on the person who served as the distraction that slowed the car down and opened the door for the dog to do what it wanted to do. I think this is indicative of intellectual rot and my view is that to some extent the movement has been exposed and they sorta blew it when they had the spotlight.", "edited": 1660731915.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ikjpzhs", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed an interesting shift among the progressive movement lately.

Their view is that white people wield disproportionately more institutional power than non-white people do, so if that\u2019s true you would want those people with outsized power and who agree with you to use that power to advance your ends. But instead they are condemning them and de-incentivizing their participation. It just seems very counterintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it really comes down to the fact that activists are insatiable. when they\u2019re actually given the reins, asked what exactly they want, and allowed to implement policies, they don\u2019t actually know. or if they do have proposals it&amp;#39;s always impractically radical stuff that only makes sense to the small group of people who agree with them like just razing institutions and starting over or defunding the police or something equally as bizzare. it reminds me a lot of the occupy wall street people. They\u2019re the dog that caught the car. They aren\u2019t there to actually catch the car, they\u2019re there to chase the car. implementing the change that they desire requires an understanding of things as they are (you have to understand the problem before you can develop a solution), but activists\u2019 characteristic commitment to ideology precludes them from interpreting the world or developing solutions that go even a bit outside the scope of their ideology. Like can anyone seriously envision a series of events and policies that would have caused BLM to be like &amp;#39;welp. that&amp;#39;s pretty much what we were asking for. you did it and solved the problem. guess we can just pack up our shit and go home.&amp;#39; like even over the course of their ideas being implemented over 10 years I can&amp;#39;t envision that occurring. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Progressive activists are the dog that caught the car, and once they caught the car and fucked it away they blamed it on the person who served as the distraction that slowed the car down and opened the door for the dog to do what it wanted to do. I think this is indicative of intellectual rot and my view is that to some extent the movement has been exposed and they sorta blew it when they had the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikjpzhs/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1660671929.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wos3do", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 45}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ikiyxbg", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ikiyxbg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "gimmickless", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660661946.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wos3do", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_5y1vp", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Front Lines in Culture War: Diversity in Policing\n\nI attend town hall meetings in my neighborhood pretty regularly.

It seems artists have abruptly phase-transitioned en masse from naysaying to fear and rage, and have promptly shut down @StableDiffusion acc with malicious reporting, in what may eventually be recorded in history books as one of the opening shots in the inevitable Neo-Luddite backlash transcending industries and political tribes. (Additionally: fresh HN discussion of [copyright infringement in AI art](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32436203), of [Stable Diffusion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32471199).) \n\nThe gnashing of teeth, gloating, motivated reasoning, [politruk-level understanding of art itself](https://mobile.twitter.com/senfflasche/status/1559311057310580736), [political allies](https://twitter.com/AmandaTNStevens/status/1557766146920783873/retweets/with_comments) and amusing narcissism ([\u00abThe tiniest cock I draw has more soul than what an AI could spit out\u00bb](https://twitter.com/Rattfood/status/1559007094598246402)) are all exactly what I've had in mind when saying that I don't like artists as a class of people and welcome their impending professional decimation by AI (a take [which invited some opposition](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijoupt6/)). Of course they'll fight back. Going beyond Twitter antics, they voice a somewhat reasonable hope for class action lawsuits and encouragement of broader regulation. Artists naturally can have power in excess of their SES, and they love to flex it. Probably it can work, if the powers that be see utility to facilitating their crusade. And maybe (returning to my constant concerns) we'll see this used as a *casus belli* for a huge push for prohibition of general-purpose compute in private hands (embraced by Lesswrongian AI alarmists and EAs, and Bostrom-WEF technocratic goons). And AI art will be reduced to some gimped alternatives like cloud-only Adobe Photoshop with $5.99 monthly fee for \u00abin the style of James Gurney\u00bb meta-brush, with royalties to James or his publisher or estate.\u02c62   \n\nThen again, maybe it'll fall through. Torrents are still here. And good luck regulating away secure comms like Matrix or Briar or, hell, PGP emails. And Stable Diffusion checkpoints are already being spread around, and a rig with four second-hand 3090s from bankrupt Ethereum miners will be enough for *a great deal* of inference. Most importantly, there's enough interest\u02c63 . Like [Emad says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ2QtKcK2dA) in the recent excellent interview\u02c64, billions of people are *creatively constipated* and they want to let it all out. This may not be singularity yet, but it's a classical [revolutionary situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_situation). To wit, the case where preservation of status quo would require drastic changes tearing away at its other aspects, introducing unsustainable runaway processes.\u02c65  \n\nThe question is, *how* does this continue? Images are of course the least of our problems. Emad can't wait to automate all forms of media production, and the market will do the rest for \u00abnormal\u00bb jobs. Savvier artists are, predictably given their socialist leanings but IMO very rationally, advocating [for basic income](https://twitter.com/basicincomecdn/status/1557374154478964737). Alas, it's not that good, and it may not be the lowest-effort adaptation of our society as it grapples with runaway optimization processes.\u02c66 And beyond that, there are direct AI risks, both existential due to alignment failure (which I'm skeptical about) and ones obvious from human history. But even for art alone, consider these asinine outcomes: \n\n- Neuralink-powered DRM: content-as-a-service streamed directly into the brain, with per-qualia billing, data interpretable only on this individual human connectome (connectome \u00abkeys\u00bb owned by Neuralink Corporation, accessed by streaming services through an API), with extreme financial and medical ramifications of tinkering. Episodic memory wiping for extra [dystopian flavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFe9wiDfb0E) (but you keep your ratings, reviews and habits!). For extra [Cheems mindset](https://normielisation.substack.com/p/cheems-mindset): ID-locked screens/output devices with always-online perceptive hash tracking of all consoomable content.  \n- Actual anarchy wiping out incentives for professional artistic work. The culture up to 2022 compressed into language to summon combinations, endless Age of the Feuilleton that Hesse adumbrated in his *The Glass Bead Game*. No more innovative one-upmanship of starving artists who sink decades into grokking the craft and exploring its rabbit holes, just \u00abX trending on artstation 8K\u00bb forever.\n\nIt's a failure of imagination to go for those. But the status quo can't continue. [The defaults don't work.](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/the-defaults-dont-work/) We need to up the learning rate to guess at the future. \n\nImportantly, what will happen with ideology inherent in contemporary art? Emad promises to train custom models for companies like Sony and Nintendo, and I suppose those will be very good (and if Stability.ai fails, eventually Sony will do it on their own or buy something from a startup or FAANG). But there probably are diminishing returns to the effect of raw quality and quantity on how compelling art feels.  \nIf you can crank out CalArts style cartoons (assuming people like that style *per se*) with right-wing talking points, and Disney or Netflix animators will do the same but 3x better with their stale propaganda of [embracing monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Beast_(2022_film)), will it matter a lot? Memes with crudely drawn pepes and chads are viral enough; indie games and Minecraft are insanely successful. The Last Of Us II was, I think, [a vessel for Druckmann's politics](https://collider.com/last-of-us-2-joel-death-neil-druckmann/), and it didn't persuade people a great deal (on the other hand, people still cite the sophomoric critique of libertarianism in Bioshock, brought to you by Ken Levine, so that depends on specifics). if Druckmann and Levine have the equivalent of Unreal Engine 6 with [automatic generation of arbitrary assets and most code](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/2/23287173/ai-image-generation-art-midjourney-multiverse-interview-david-holz), and Zorba and his friend have the equivalent of mere UE 4 with the same properties, downgraded \u2013 will it matter that the former duo has access to AAA tier promotion and the latter just go on Steam and get word-of-mouth fame? \n\nFinally, will artistry, \u00abstyle\u00bb, *stylization* itself survive when it's not scarce? Will it advance to its llimits?\u02c67 Or will the people, surfeited with it, cast away gimmicks and choose simple, beautiful, ecologically valid naturalism with well-told archetypal stories? Or on the contrary, decide that Apple was right and legible schematics that are easy on the mind are the best \u2013 art fading away much like the adolescent Android modding and ricing of desktops?  Will it shard into tiny niche superstimuli, or will generic ones be quickly discovered?
