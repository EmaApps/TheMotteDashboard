['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of July 25, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_w7h8wa", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658729709.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

The [full text](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22122281-inflation_reduction_act_of_2022) is here if you're interested, a breezy read at 725 pages.  This [one page summary](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22122297-inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary) gives a quick breakdown, and [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/manchin-climate-tax-bill.html) has a pretty solid summary of the key stuff:\n\n&gt;The package would set aside $369 billion for climate and energy proposals, the most ambitious climate action ever taken by Congress, and raise an estimated $451 billion in new tax revenue over a decade, while cutting federal spending on prescription drugs by $288 billion, according to a summary circulated Wednesday evening.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;. . .  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The two health care pieces would allow Medicare to directly regulate the price of prescription drugs for the first time beginning in 2023. It would also extend through 2025 an expansion of premium subsidies that Democrats first pushed through in 2021 as part of their $1.9 trillion pandemic aid bill, preventing a lapse at the end of the year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The plan would raise most of its new tax revenue, an estimated $313 billion, by imposing a minimum tax on the so-called book income of large corporations, like Amazon and FedEx, that currently use tax credits and other maneuvers to reduce their tax rates below the 21 percent corporate income tax rate in the United States.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It would raise another $14 billion by reducing a preferential tax treatment for income earned by venture capitalists and private equity firms, which has long been a goal of Democrats.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It invests $30 billion in production tax credits for solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and critical minerals processing; $10 billion in tax credits to build clean technology manufacturing facilities; and $500 million to be used through the Defense Production Act for heat pumps and critical minerals processing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The deal also includes a means-tested $7,500 tax credit to make new electric vehicles more affordable, and a $4,000 tax credit for used electric vehicles, according to a summary of the package. Both credits will be offered only to lower and middle-income consumers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The measure also includes a methane fee that will start in 2025.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also included will be $60 billion to address the disproportionate burden of pollution on low-income communities and communities of color, $27 billion for a \u201cgreen bank\u201d aimed at delivering financial support to clean energy projects and $20 billion for programs that can cut emissions in the agriculture sector.\n\nRelevant to our discussion yesterday about Trump and DeSantis, the bill also includes \"comprehensive permitting reform\" aimed at making building easier, though not a lot of details have been released so far and I haven't trawled the bill yet.\n\nI'm pretty into everything I see here at first glance, especially the provision allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and also the investments in electric vehicles and related clean energy technologies (as you might have guessed from my posts ranting about gas reliance always exposing us to international crises).  I see nothing about nuclear power in the summary unfortunately (edit: see u/ChrisPrattAlphaRaptr's comment for details on what they are doing).\n\nI'm a little surprised at some of the tax stuff - if we're going after paying back the deficit why focus on carried interest and not capital gains in general, one of Biden's original pledges?  Presumably lost in compromise I suppose.  I've been unconvinced by the arguments that eliminating the capital gains tax will choke off investment since so much of venture capital is from already tax-exempt sources like pension funds, but possibly also they were worried about choking off investment at a time when fears of a recession are already growing.  Note that Manchin also put the kibosh on attempts from the coastal senators to raise the SALT cap, which I consider to be a plus.\n\nNote  also that this bill isn't guaranteed; Kyrsten Sinema hasn't weighed in yet and we haven't actually heard from every other Democratic senator either.\n\nThis comes a day after the Senate passing an actually bipartisan (64-33) [industrial policy bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/senate-chips-china.html) aimed at countering China and in particular onshoring the semiconductor industry:\n\n&gt;The bill, a convergence of economic and national security policy, would provide $52 billion in subsidies and additional tax credits to companies that manufacture chips in the United States. It also would add $200 billion for scientific research, especially into artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing and a variety of other technologies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The bill calls for pouring $10 billion into the Department of Commerce \u2014 which would also dole out the chips subsidies to companies that apply \u2014 to create 20 \u201cregional technology hubs\u201d across the country. The brainchild of Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, and Mr. Schumer, the hubs would aim to link together research universities with private industry in an effort to create Silicon Valley-like centers for technology innovation in areas hollowed out by globalization.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The legislation would steer billions to the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation to promote both basic research and research and development into advanced semiconductor manufacturing, as well as work force development programs, in an effort to build a labor pipeline for a slew of emerging industries.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;. . .  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The bill also seeks to create research and development and manufacturing jobs in the long run. It includes provisions aimed at building up pipelines of workers \u2014 through work force development grants and other programs \u2014 concentrated in once-booming industrial hubs hollowed out by corporate offshoring.\n\nI haven't read nearly as much about this one but interested and heartned to see any piece of major legislation passed with such substantial cross-aisle cooperation.

If the city takes 11 days, that's another 20% off the permit fee.\n* Cities must post the entire process on an online dashboard for tracking.\n* Counties must post a list of all required attachments, drawings, or other requirements for each type of application, on its website, as well as explicitly outline the procedures for approval/denial. (This makes it very easy to both a) submit a valid application and b) sue if the county denies improperly.)\n\nAs per an [analysis in the WaPo](https://archive.ph/aXfCK), it's working.

(This is single family homes, rules and time periods are a bit different for bigger projects.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If your application is declared incomplete, and you make it complete, localities have 10 days to approve/reject. If the city takes 11 days, that&amp;#39;s another 20% off the permit fee.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cities must post the entire process on an online dashboard for tracking.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Counties must post a list of all required attachments, drawings, or other requirements for each type of application, on its website, as well as explicitly outline the procedures for approval/denial. (This makes it very easy to both a) submit a valid application and b) sue if the county denies improperly.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As per an &lt;a href=\"https://archive.ph/aXfCK\"&gt;analysis in the WaPo&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s working. Permit processing rates (in 30 days) have gone from 47% to 80%, 100% in some places. This is enabling a lot more housing permits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, it seems that to very little fanfare, Ron DeSantis has become a great champion of YIMBY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While his culture war antics may get press (and cause YIMBY activities to ignore him cause &amp;quot;ewww&amp;quot;) DeSantis also appears to be a person actively focused on the details of governance. This is something something that should get significantly more attention than it actually does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPermit reform doesn\u2019t sound glamorous.

Advertising revenues are down across the board, as Apple and others have instituted better privacy protections for users, and the economy seems headed for a general downturn so ad revenues will likely follow.\n\n[Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.) for those of you that aren't aware, is a messaging app that send self-destructing picture/video and sometimes text messages. When it launched, it was the first service to really make the disappearing pic/video big, and that made it popular with teenagers/20-somethings who wanted to send pictures that they might be embarrassed by later. Besides the obvious sexting use-case (the privacy was of course much worse than promised), I also recall having a lot of male friends that loved to send me pictures of their giant poops as a gag, and people liked to use it at parties to send drunken videos that wouldn't last any longer than necessary. Its use was always casual, no one wrote a thesis on Snapchat the way they have on Twitter/Reddit or made art on it the way they have on Instagram/TikTok.

Somebody is going to, or already has, lost a lot of money on this.\n\nAnd it's summer, so I'm thinking of summer trips to the Jersey Shore as a kid, and the Surf Mall on the boardwalk that was like a big pseudo-department store with every summer fad or gimmick of the year. I think I've been inside it most years since about 1998 or so, and every year the majority of their entire stock of stuff is different. One year it's drug rug hoodies, the next year it is marvel themed sweatshirts, the next everything is in a certain shade of pink. Baseball cards become Pokemon cards become YuGiOh cards become Funko Pops (I think? I'm still not entirely sure what those are beyond hearing them in sneers) comes all the way back around to first edition Holo Charizard Pokemon Cards. \n\nAnd I'm thinking about it, the Surf Mall proprietors if you asked them would say they need to make money on whatever they are selling before it goes out of fashion, and run their business each year at a profit on that item. And their suppliers would say, we're selling these sweatshirts at a price where we can make money this year before they go out of fashion next year and then we'll make something else, whether they are manufactured in NJ or in Sichuan they are able to figure out what their customer will move to. I feel like that's what we've lost in this business environment, you get a gimmick you and recognize it and you cash in while you can, then move on. Snapchat was a gimmick, it was always a gimmick, and anyone who knew teenagers using it would have said \"Yeah, this is a gimmick.\" A business like that should have been trying to actually make money off its business while the going was good. What is it that leads to this attitude:\n\n1) Is it that everyone is trying to get the next Amazon or Google? Are all these investors just foolishly playing the lottery? Are they all lemmings following a few leaders on CNBC or whatever who fell for the lottery approach?\n\n2) On a related note, cult of the founder? Snapchat's founding pair will always control 98% of voting shares, much like WeWork before them, were investors snookered by a few charismatic guys?\n\n3) Generation gap expanding? Maybe middle aged businessmen get physical fads like Pokemon cards because they saw similar things when they were teens, but digital fads confuse them because they didn't experience them. This should become less true over time, as digital generations age, but it does not seem to be. It would have been obvious, in my mind, to any 19 year old sexting on Snap that Snap was not a $100bn company for the future, it was a fun thing you would stop doing soon enough. There's a disconnect between the customer and the investor somewhere.\n\n4) Cult of the future? I'm probably more plugged into fashion than most Motte-izens, and you see this as well in fashion companies where brands are constantly decried for not keeping up with the times, or alternatively for selling out when they get big, when the reasonable explanation for the vast majority of brands is that they're big for a while and then they disappear.

A few commenters replied that this was probably because of Biden \u2013 he opened up his term by cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline, removing permits on drilling on federal lands and saying we should move towards fully green energy.

But there\u2019s still a lot of shale and crude prices are crazy high again and no one\u2019s drilling.  I think [both](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/comment/ih8bt2a/?context=3) [users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/comment/ih89f6l/?context=3) made compelling arguments (if i followed them), substantiated with the articles I can find with quotes from oil leaders, that the primary driver of investment isn't really regulatory policy, it's the fact that everyone is too worried about massive market fluctuations.  OPEC cratered prices after the initial shale boom and hurt a lot of investors, and Covid saw barrels going for negative prices.  Who wants to invest in drilling more when the market could switch up on you and completely destroy your profits?  [To quote](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-18/shale-wildcatters-send-bullish-oil-price-signal-with-output-restraint):\n\n&gt;\u201cWhether it\u2019s $150 oil, $200 oil, or $100 oil, we\u2019re not going to change our growth plans,\u2019\u2019 Pioneer Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield said during a Bloomberg Television interview. \u201cIf the president wants us to grow, I just don\u2019t think the industry can grow anyway.\u2019\u2019\n\nI think here this offers us two possibilities, with two questions I\u2019d ask everyone.\n\n1:  If we assume government policy can\u2019t make a huge difference on oil investment relative to the market, and the market experiences such dramatic fluctuations that investors literally won\u2019t invest in drilling more even when it would be profitable, and that this common sense market rationale means we all have to eat high gas prices: is this not an extremely strong argument for trying to divest away from oil?  To invest full scale in nuclear and renewables (edit: and battery storage technology) and microgrids and the infrastructure to make electric vehicles possible and widespread?\n\nMuch is talked about the intermittency issues with renewables, but should the fact that Russia and China each control 15% of the world\u2019s oil production, and petroleum sales can always be used as a carrot or stick in conflicts like the current one, and that we don\u2019t have the ability to control OPEC with their further 44% of the world\u2019s production \u2013 shouldn\u2019t all this be seen functionally as an broad scale intermittency problem as well?  You can address shortfalls with wind and solar in a number of ways, like using combined heat and gas systems or only using them to complement nuclear power, but in crisis situations where 15% of the world\u2019s oil disappears off of the western markets there doesn\u2019t seem to be any quick fix \u2013 our oil companies outright say the won\u2019t drill more no matter what the president does!\n\nI\u2019m well aware this would be a cost intensive and technologically challenging road, and that renewables in particular have other huge limitations and could perhaps never fully fill the gap fossil fuels played, but wouldn\u2019t shrinking our fossil fuel dependency alone go significantly far towards reducing our exposure to these kinds of crises?  Would the eventual problems we might face in a country that invested to the hilt in electric cars, nuclear energy, renewable energy systems and decentralized microgrids be worse than what we\u2019re dealing with now?  Would it be worse than the fact that our country is always vulnerable having the pipe turned off from the outside?\n\n2:  Alternatively, maybe none of the obvious stuff Biden could do would help oil.  But let\u2019s pretend he can - what if he did all the non-obvious stuff as well?  What if Biden completely deregulated oil, cut their taxes down to zero, gave them (more) massive subsidies and promised to insure any losses from market fluctuations, slashed wages, cut all zoning laws, worker\u2019s rights, safety regulations and environmental regulations and finally got domestic oil production to rise.\n\nWould it be worth it?\n\nSometimes I\u2019m jealous of China\u2019s powerful industrial base.  Then I think about their horrendously polluted waterways and their skies full of smog and their workers paid pittances to labor for crazy hours in often unsafe conditions, and I wonder if it would be worth having to do all that to compete with them on some kind of even footing.\n\nWould it be worth producing two, three, four times as much oil, enough that we have dominance over the world price and never have to worry about this situation again, if we also had to trade away our centuries of hard-fought worker\u2019s rights? If all of our gorgeous national parks were studded with oil wells and refineries and our waterways and skies groaned under the weight of their pollution?  This is an exaggerated example to be sure, but in a world where oil executives outright say the President\u2019s normal policy levers won\u2019t change their investment outlook, it bears worth asking: how much are we actually willing to give up to change that?", "edited": 1658761324.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ihkqcw6", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow up from &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih7jtj4/?context=3\"&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; about oil prices a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the sub-questions I was curious about was why oil companies weren\u2019t investing more in digging new wells.

To invest full scale in nuclear and renewables (edit: and battery storage technology) and microgrids and the infrastructure to make electric vehicles possible and widespread?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much is talked about the intermittency issues with renewables, but should the fact that Russia and China each control 15% of the world\u2019s oil production, and petroleum sales can always be used as a carrot or stick in conflicts like the current one, and that we don\u2019t have the ability to control OPEC with their further 44% of the world\u2019s production \u2013 shouldn\u2019t all this be seen functionally as an broad scale intermittency problem as well?  You can address shortfalls with wind and solar in a number of ways, like using combined heat and gas systems or only using them to complement nuclear power, but in crisis situations where 15% of the world\u2019s oil disappears off of the western markets there doesn\u2019t seem to be any quick fix \u2013 our oil companies outright say the won\u2019t drill more no matter what the president does!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m well aware this would be a cost intensive and technologically challenging road, and that renewables in particular have other huge limitations and could perhaps never fully fill the gap fossil fuels played, but wouldn\u2019t shrinking our fossil fuel dependency alone go significantly far towards reducing our exposure to these kinds of crises?  Would the eventual problems we might face in a country that invested to the hilt in electric cars, nuclear energy, renewable energy systems and decentralized microgrids be worse than what we\u2019re dealing with now?  Would it be worse than the fact that our country is always vulnerable having the pipe turned off from the outside?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2:  Alternatively, maybe none of the obvious stuff Biden could do would help oil.  But let\u2019s pretend he can - what if he did all the non-obvious stuff as well?  What if Biden completely deregulated oil, cut their taxes down to zero, gave them (more) massive subsidies and promised to insure any losses from market fluctuations, slashed wages, cut all zoning laws, worker\u2019s rights, safety regulations and environmental regulations and finally got domestic oil production to rise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would it be worth it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I\u2019m jealous of China\u2019s powerful industrial base.  Then I think about their horrendously polluted waterways and their skies full of smog and their workers paid pittances to labor for crazy hours in often unsafe conditions, and I wonder if it would be worth having to do all that to compete with them on some kind of even footing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would it be worth producing two, three, four times as much oil, enough that we have dominance over the world price and never have to worry about this situation again, if we also had to trade away our centuries of hard-fought worker\u2019s rights? If all of our gorgeous national parks were studded with oil wells and refineries and our waterways and skies groaned under the weight of their pollution?  This is an exaggerated example to be sure, but in a world where oil executives outright say the President\u2019s normal policy levers won\u2019t change their investment outlook, it bears worth asking: how much are we actually willing to give up to change that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihkqcw6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1658755905.0, "author_flair_text": "it\u2019s all so tiresome", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_w7h8wa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 19}}], "before": null}}]
