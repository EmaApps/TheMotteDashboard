Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!'

This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series.

It seems artists have abruptly phase-transitioned en masse from naysaying to fear and rage, and have promptly shut down @StableDiffusion acc with malicious reporting, in what may eventually be recorded in history books as one of the opening shots in the inevitable Neo-Luddite backlash transcending industries and political tribes. (Additionally: fresh HN discussion of [copyright infringement in AI art](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32436203), of [Stable Diffusion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32471199).) \n\nThe gnashing of teeth, gloating, motivated reasoning, [politruk-level understanding of art itself](https://mobile.twitter.com/senfflasche/status/1559311057310580736), [political allies](https://twitter.com/AmandaTNStevens/status/1557766146920783873/retweets/with_comments) and amusing narcissism ([\u00abThe tiniest cock I draw has more soul than what an AI could spit out\u00bb](https://twitter.com/Rattfood/status/1559007094598246402)) are all exactly what I've had in mind when saying that I don't like artists as a class of people and welcome their impending professional decimation by AI (a take [which invited some opposition](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijoupt6/)). Of course they'll fight back. Going beyond Twitter antics, they voice a somewhat reasonable hope for class action lawsuits and encouragement of broader regulation. Artists naturally can have power in excess of their SES, and they love to flex it. Probably it can work, if the powers that be see utility to facilitating their crusade. And maybe (returning to my constant concerns) we'll see this used as a *casus belli* for a huge push for prohibition of general-purpose compute in private hands (embraced by Lesswrongian AI alarmists and EAs, and Bostrom-WEF technocratic goons). And AI art will be reduced to some gimped alternatives like cloud-only Adobe Photoshop with $5.99 monthly fee for \u00abin the style of James Gurney\u00bb meta-brush, with royalties to James or his publisher or estate.\u02c62   \n\nThen again, maybe it'll fall through. Torrents are still here. And good luck regulating away secure comms like Matrix or Briar or, hell, PGP emails. And Stable Diffusion checkpoints are already being spread around, and a rig with four second-hand 3090s from bankrupt Ethereum miners will be enough for *a great deal* of inference. Most importantly, there's enough interest\u02c63 . Like [Emad says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ2QtKcK2dA) in the recent excellent interview\u02c64, billions of people are *creatively constipated* and they want to let it all out. This may not be singularity yet, but it's a classical [revolutionary situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_situation). To wit, the case where preservation of status quo would require drastic changes tearing away at its other aspects, introducing unsustainable runaway processes.\u02c65  \n\nThe question is, *how* does this continue? Images are of course the least of our problems. Emad can't wait to automate all forms of media production, and the market will do the rest for \u00abnormal\u00bb jobs. Savvier artists are, predictably given their socialist leanings but IMO very rationally, advocating [for basic income](https://twitter.com/basicincomecdn/status/1557374154478964737). Alas, it's not that good, and it may not be the lowest-effort adaptation of our society as it grapples with runaway optimization processes.\u02c66 And beyond that, there are direct AI risks, both existential due to alignment failure (which I'm skeptical about) and ones obvious from human history. But even for art alone, consider these asinine outcomes: \n\n- Neuralink-powered DRM: content-as-a-service streamed directly into the brain, with per-qualia billing, data interpretable only on this individual human connectome (connectome \u00abkeys\u00bb owned by Neuralink Corporation, accessed by streaming services through an API), with extreme financial and medical ramifications of tinkering. Episodic memory wiping for extra [dystopian flavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFe9wiDfb0E) (but you keep your ratings, reviews and habits!). For extra [Cheems mindset](https://normielisation.substack.com/p/cheems-mindset): ID-locked screens/output devices with always-online perceptive hash tracking of all consoomable content.  \n- Actual anarchy wiping out incentives for professional artistic work. The culture up to 2022 compressed into language to summon combinations, endless Age of the Feuilleton that Hesse adumbrated in his *The Glass Bead Game*. No more innovative one-upmanship of starving artists who sink decades into grokking the craft and exploring its rabbit holes, just \u00abX trending on artstation 8K\u00bb forever.\n\nIt's a failure of imagination to go for those. But the status quo can't continue. [The defaults don't work.](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/the-defaults-dont-work/) We need to up the learning rate to guess at the future. \n\nImportantly, what will happen with ideology inherent in contemporary art? Emad promises to train custom models for companies like Sony and Nintendo, and I suppose those will be very good (and if Stability.ai fails, eventually Sony will do it on their own or buy something from a startup or FAANG). But there probably are diminishing returns to the effect of raw quality and quantity on how compelling art feels.  \nIf you can crank out CalArts style cartoons (assuming people like that style *per se*) with right-wing talking points, and Disney or Netflix animators will do the same but 3x better with their stale propaganda of [embracing monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Beast_(2022_film)), will it matter a lot? Memes with crudely drawn pepes and chads are viral enough; indie games and Minecraft are insanely successful. The Last Of Us II was, I think, [a vessel for Druckmann's politics](https://collider.com/last-of-us-2-joel-death-neil-druckmann/), and it didn't persuade people a great deal (on the other hand, people still cite the sophomoric critique of libertarianism in Bioshock, brought to you by Ken Levine, so that depends on specifics). if Druckmann and Levine have the equivalent of Unreal Engine 6 with [automatic generation of arbitrary assets and most code](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/2/23287173/ai-image-generation-art-midjourney-multiverse-interview-david-holz), and Zorba and his friend have the equivalent of mere UE 4 with the same properties, downgraded \u2013 will it matter that the former duo has access to AAA tier promotion and the latter just go on Steam and get word-of-mouth fame? \n\nFinally, will artistry, \u00abstyle\u00bb, *stylization* itself survive when it's not scarce? Will it advance to its llimits?\u02c67 Or will the people, surfeited with it, cast away gimmicks and choose simple, beautiful, ecologically valid naturalism with well-told archetypal stories? Or on the contrary, decide that Apple was right and legible schematics that are easy on the mind are the best \u2013 art fading away much like the adolescent Android modding and ricing of desktops?  Will it shard into tiny niche superstimuli, or will generic ones be quickly discovered? How will this play together with VR, Metaverse and its private equivalents, and generational churn? \n\nI honestly have no idea. \n\nFootnotes in two posts below are not 100% pertinent to the topic and can be ignored.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ikgubw7", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you think the industry, culture of art and art itself will change in the era of easily achievable post-scarcity for custom content?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few jumbled thoughts, rearranged into Linear Ilfortese B on the advice of &lt;a href=\"/u/f3zinker\"&gt;/u/f3zinker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the beta rollout of Stable Diffusion (previously &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij9ge8b/\"&gt;shilled here&lt;/a&gt;), digital artists &lt;a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/arvalis/status/1558623545374023680\"&gt;have finally taken notice&lt;/a&gt; of text-to-image models, and particularly their ability to imitate individual, modern styles\u02c61\u00a0.

This may not be singularity yet, but it&amp;#39;s a classical &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_situation\"&gt;revolutionary situation&lt;/a&gt;. To wit, the case where preservation of status quo would require drastic changes tearing away at its other aspects, introducing unsustainable runaway processes.\u02c65  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question is, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; does this continue? Images are of course the least of our problems. Emad can&amp;#39;t wait to automate all forms of media production, and the market will do the rest for \u00abnormal\u00bb jobs. Savvier artists are, predictably given their socialist leanings but IMO very rationally, advocating &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/basicincomecdn/status/1557374154478964737\"&gt;for basic income&lt;/a&gt;. Alas, it&amp;#39;s not that good, and it may not be the lowest-effort adaptation of our society as it grapples with runaway optimization processes.\u02c66 And beyond that, there are direct AI risks, both existential due to alignment failure (which I&amp;#39;m skeptical about) and ones obvious from human history. But even for art alone, consider these asinine outcomes: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Neuralink-powered DRM: content-as-a-service streamed directly into the brain, with per-qualia billing, data interpretable only on this individual human connectome (connectome \u00abkeys\u00bb owned by Neuralink Corporation, accessed by streaming services through an API), with extreme financial and medical ramifications of tinkering. Episodic memory wiping for extra &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFe9wiDfb0E\"&gt;dystopian flavor&lt;/a&gt; (but you keep your ratings, reviews and habits!). For extra &lt;a href=\"https://normielisation.substack.com/p/cheems-mindset\"&gt;Cheems mindset&lt;/a&gt;: ID-locked screens/output devices with always-online perceptive hash tracking of all consoomable content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Actual anarchy wiping out incentives for professional artistic work. The culture up to 2022 compressed into language to summon combinations, endless Age of the Feuilleton that Hesse adumbrated in his &lt;em&gt;The Glass Bead Game&lt;/em&gt;. No more innovative one-upmanship of starving artists who sink decades into grokking the craft and exploring its rabbit holes, just \u00abX trending on artstation 8K\u00bb forever.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a failure of imagination to go for those. But the status quo can&amp;#39;t continue. &lt;a href=\"https://moultano.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/the-defaults-dont-work/\"&gt;The defaults don&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/a&gt; We need to up the learning rate to guess at the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Importantly, what will happen with ideology inherent in contemporary art? Emad promises to train custom models for companies like Sony and Nintendo, and I suppose those will be very good (and if Stability.ai fails, eventually Sony will do it on their own or buy something from a startup or FAANG). But there probably are diminishing returns to the effect of raw quality and quantity on how compelling art feels.&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you can crank out CalArts style cartoons (assuming people like that style &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;) with right-wing talking points, and Disney or Netflix animators will do the same but 3x better with their stale propaganda of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Beast_(2022_film\"&gt;embracing monsters&lt;/a&gt;), will it matter a lot? Memes with crudely drawn pepes and chads are viral enough; indie games and Minecraft are insanely successful. The Last Of Us II was, I think, &lt;a href=\"https://collider.com/last-of-us-2-joel-death-neil-druckmann/\"&gt;a vessel for Druckmann&amp;#39;s politics&lt;/a&gt;, and it didn&amp;#39;t persuade people a great deal (on the other hand, people still cite the sophomoric critique of libertarianism in Bioshock, brought to you by Ken Levine, so that depends on specifics). if Druckmann and Levine have the equivalent of Unreal Engine 6 with &lt;a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/2/23287173/ai-image-generation-art-midjourney-multiverse-interview-david-holz\"&gt;automatic generation of arbitrary assets and most code&lt;/a&gt;, and Zorba and his friend have the equivalent of mere UE 4 with the same properties, downgraded \u2013 will it matter that the former duo has access to AAA tier promotion and the latter just go on Steam and get word-of-mouth fame? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, will artistry, \u00abstyle\u00bb, &lt;em&gt;stylization&lt;/em&gt; itself survive when it&amp;#39;s not scarce? Will it advance to its llimits?\u02c67 Or will the people, surfeited with it, cast away gimmicks and choose simple, beautiful, ecologically valid naturalism with well-told archetypal stories? Or on the contrary, decide that Apple was right and legible schematics that are easy on the mind are the best \u2013 art fading away much like the adolescent Android modding and ricing of desktops?  Will it shard into tiny niche superstimuli, or will generic ones be quickly discovered? How will this play together with VR, Metaverse and its private equivalents, and generational churn? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly have no idea. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Footnotes in two posts below are not 100% pertinent to the topic and can be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikgubw7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1660616224.0, "author_flair_text": "\u00abGuillemet\u00bb is not an ADL-recognized hate symbol yet", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wos3do", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ikgj8k4", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ikgj8k4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "dblackdrake", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660611394.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wos3do", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_sxv2p", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Ukraine update time!\n\nSituation remains the same as last week, no major changes.

For those who aren't familiar, here's a rundown: Prior to WWII, most urban poor (minorities in particular) lived in overcrowded tenement housing. This was privately-owned, market-rate housing, but conditions were considered substandard at the time and are unthinkable now. A lot of the apartments lacked windows or any kind of ventilation, most units had shared bathrooms, and some still relied on outhouses (in the city) into the 1950s. A lot of the stuff that would easily fail a code inspection now was par for the course. Conditions were crowded to the point that, as one woman recalls, her mother had to sleep in the kitchen as they had to fit 12 people into a 3 room apartment. \n\nFollowing the War, there was an increased drive to move tenement-dwellers into modern apartments. This drive had actually started prior to the War, but gained increased impetus when the Housing Act of 1949 made Federal money available to construct housing projects. Throughout the '20s and '30s, the modernist architecture movement had provided a blueprint of how the ideal city should look, and city planners took full advantage of these architects when money became available to put their plans into action. (A detailed description of modern architectural principles is beyond the scope of this post, but if you're unfamiliar, look up Corbusier to get an idea of what we're dealing with). \n\nAt first, the project was deemed a smashing success. The design won awards. Early residents talked about how, for the first time in their lives, they were living somewhere where everything was new, and clean, and there was adequate space. On woman said she felt like she was moving into a high-end resort. Another, who was a child at the time, talked about moving in around Christmas, with the moon shining off the snow and lights in every window, and how it felt magical, like they'd finally escaped the slums.\n\nNeedless to say, this feeling didn't last. Within a few years, the place was in noticeable decline, and within ten, it was practically hell on earth. Maintenance issues, exacerbated by vandalism, added danger and seediness. Vacancy rates were high, leading entire buildings to eventually be abandoned, some of which were taken over by drug gangs. Robbery and rape were common in the now unlit stairwells and in the vast expanses between buildings residents entering to complex from the outside had to negotiate to get to their apartments. Security was lax, and police and other emergency personnel were reluctant to respond to calls for fear of their own safety. While an activist organization was able to form to seek redress for these issues, social cohesion was otherwise low, as most law-abiding residents felt unsafe outside their apartments. Throughout the city and nationwide, Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis became a metaphor for everything that was wrong with the inner-city.\n\nIn 1968, the activist group staged a rent strike to force the housing authority to address the maintenance and safety issues. The authority, who had for years blamed these issues on lack of funding, asked how they could address any of them if they were starved of the one funding source they could rely on. But the residents had only seen things worsen over the years and wondered what they were paying for. Eventually, the city caved, and rent was capped at 25% of income and there was a commitment to address the maintenance issues. This victory was short-lived, however, as cold air getting in through broken windows that had not been fixed caused water lines to freeze and flood the remaining occupied buildings. At this point, just 15 years after opening, the project was deemed a lost cause, and the remaining residents were slowly relocated elsewhere. In 1972, the project was closed permanently, and all the buildings were demolished by 1976. \n\nArt critics and historians often point to the day in 1972 that the first set of buildings were imploded as \"the day modernism died\". The contention is that the high-minded principles espoused by Le Corbusier and others had been proven empirically incorrect by what Pruitt\u2013Igoe and other, similar high-rise projects had become. This new generation of critics could cite a laundry list of fallacious assumptions that the modernists had made, and, after all, you could tell just by looking at places like Brasilia and Le Corbusier's designs for a new Paris that these weren't places anyone would want to live. The modernists were designing for an idealized version of man, and accordingly ended up disregarding basic human needs. Thus we get living space that is too small, outdoor promenades and piazzas that nobody really uses for anything, etc. On a more straightforward note, social scientists argue that it's simply a bad idea to put large numbers of struggling people all in one large building, as these projects end up breeding all kinds of horrible pathologies. \n\nAs you may have guessed, *The Pruitt\u2013Igoe Myth* fights back against these assumptions. The main thrust of their argument is that complaining about the architecture completely ignores the socioeconomic and demographic factors that led to the most immediate problems. The Federal Housing Act provided money for construction, but not for maintenance; it was assumed that maintenance costs would be paid for out of rents. However, the project had been built based on projections that the population of St. Louis would rise over the coming decades. The population of the city itself ended up decreasing from a high of 850,000 in 1950 to only about 620,000 in 1970, fueled by increasing suburbanization. Accordingly, the project had a high vacancy rate from day one, and the money the housing authority was relying on for maintenance never materialized. As the maintenance backlog increased and the city population decreased, the budget went into a death spiral from which it couldn't recover. Meanwhile, a declining population meant that housing in more desirable areas was becoming available at low prices, so the project, which was originally intended to be a mix of low and middle income residents, ended up only attracting those who had nowhere else to go. It also touches on ancillary issues like racism, lack of policing, Federal housing policy, etc., but it doesn't go into them in too great of detail. \n\nDoes it succeed in making its thesis? Sort of. The theory is plausible on its face, and it certainly explains why the project failed so soon. The problem is that similar projects were tried in practically every major American city, and there isn't one anyone can point to as a success. Some of these places did last well into the 2000s, but the film doesn't examine any of them to see if their problems were due to similar factors. Anecdotally speaking, Pittsburgh's housing projects supposedly didn't get bad until the mid-'80s, but this is coming from residents and not statistics. Again, these problems were also supposedly exacerbated by lack of maintenance, so it's hard to say whether the producers of the film are on to something. One crucial distinction here, though, is that most of Pittsburgh's housing projects are and were low rises, and there doesn't seem to be any correlation between how bad a project is and how big the building is. This is in contrast to the complaints of the art critics and some of the social scientists, who argued that low-rise developments were inherently superior because they were better integrated into the existing community. The counterargument here is that Pittsburgh's low-rises weren't integrated into the community at all\u2014they were usually places on isolated hilltops or in ravines, and often had only one way in and out. So I don't know what to make of this.\n\nThe other issue is that all this discussion about modernism and art critics\u2014it's not in the film, I just happen to be familiar with it. This is the film's biggest flaw; there's a theory on why the project failed but no discussion of the theory behind why it was supposed to work or in-depth examination of the criticisms of that theory once the failure became apparent. Instead we get mostly reminiscences from former residents interspersed with a few comments from a social scientist. There's certainly no examination of the counterarguments.\n\nThe reason I wanted to write this up here is because the film's central thesis is intriguing in light of our current housing crisis and homelessness problem. I was riding my bike along the Riverfront trails in Pittsburgh last weekend and I noticed that tents lined the path wherever there was room for them. The previous mayor had a lax attitude toward homeless enforcement but this was different; the tents were well-kept and the people living in them didn't really look homeless. There was no evidence of drinking or drug use other than the occasional beer, and one ten's door was open and the inside was reasonably organized. It should also be mentioned that vagrancy downtown was a problem during the Peduto administration but it's not nearly as bad now, so there's obviously some additional enforcement going on. I found out later that the people living in these tents have housing vouchers from the county nut there's nowhere to put them, so they were given tents and permission to set them up until they find apartments. For most of my life, I had been inclined to agree with most of the experts, that public housing was a bad idea for all the usual reasons. But if the result of relying on Section 8 and affordable set asides in market-rate developments just leads to a housing shortage, is it really worse than the alternative? Large projects may be bad, but it's probably better than sleeping on the street. Furthermore, are they inherently bad, or only bad because of mismanagement and failure to deal with vacancies? These are tough questions, but unfortunately, *The Pruitt\u2013Igoe Myth* doesn't answer them.", "edited": 1660589536.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ikelhsn", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I watched a documentary about the Pruitt\u2013Igoe housing project, &lt;em&gt;The Pruitt\u2013Igoe Myth&lt;/em&gt;.

A lot of the stuff that would easily fail a code inspection now was par for the course. Conditions were crowded to the point that, as one woman recalls, her mother had to sleep in the kitchen as they had to fit 12 people into a 3 room apartment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following the War, there was an increased drive to move tenement-dwellers into modern apartments. This drive had actually started prior to the War, but gained increased impetus when the Housing Act of 1949 made Federal money available to construct housing projects. Throughout the &amp;#39;20s and &amp;#39;30s, the modernist architecture movement had provided a blueprint of how the ideal city should look, and city planners took full advantage of these architects when money became available to put their plans into action. (A detailed description of modern architectural principles is beyond the scope of this post, but if you&amp;#39;re unfamiliar, look up Corbusier to get an idea of what we&amp;#39;re dealing with). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, the project was deemed a smashing success. The design won awards. Early residents talked about how, for the first time in their lives, they were living somewhere where everything was new, and clean, and there was adequate space. On woman said she felt like she was moving into a high-end resort. Another, who was a child at the time, talked about moving in around Christmas, with the moon shining off the snow and lights in every window, and how it felt magical, like they&amp;#39;d finally escaped the slums.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this feeling didn&amp;#39;t last. Within a few years, the place was in noticeable decline, and within ten, it was practically hell on earth. Maintenance issues, exacerbated by vandalism, added danger and seediness. Vacancy rates were high, leading entire buildings to eventually be abandoned, some of which were taken over by drug gangs. Robbery and rape were common in the now unlit stairwells and in the vast expanses between buildings residents entering to complex from the outside had to negotiate to get to their apartments. Security was lax, and police and other emergency personnel were reluctant to respond to calls for fear of their own safety. While an activist organization was able to form to seek redress for these issues, social cohesion was otherwise low, as most law-abiding residents felt unsafe outside their apartments. Throughout the city and nationwide, Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis became a metaphor for everything that was wrong with the inner-city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1968, the activist group staged a rent strike to force the housing authority to address the maintenance and safety issues. The authority, who had for years blamed these issues on lack of funding, asked how they could address any of them if they were starved of the one funding source they could rely on. But the residents had only seen things worsen over the years and wondered what they were paying for. Eventually, the city caved, and rent was capped at 25% of income and there was a commitment to address the maintenance issues. This victory was short-lived, however, as cold air getting in through broken windows that had not been fixed caused water lines to freeze and flood the remaining occupied buildings. At this point, just 15 years after opening, the project was deemed a lost cause, and the remaining residents were slowly relocated elsewhere. In 1972, the project was closed permanently, and all the buildings were demolished by 1976. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Art critics and historians often point to the day in 1972 that the first set of buildings were imploded as &amp;quot;the day modernism died&amp;quot;. The contention is that the high-minded principles espoused by Le Corbusier and others had been proven empirically incorrect by what Pruitt\u2013Igoe and other, similar high-rise projects had become. This new generation of critics could cite a laundry list of fallacious assumptions that the modernists had made, and, after all, you could tell just by looking at places like Brasilia and Le Corbusier&amp;#39;s designs for a new Paris that these weren&amp;#39;t places anyone would want to live. The modernists were designing for an idealized version of man, and accordingly ended up disregarding basic human needs. Thus we get living space that is too small, outdoor promenades and piazzas that nobody really uses for anything, etc. On a more straightforward note, social scientists argue that it&amp;#39;s simply a bad idea to put large numbers of struggling people all in one large building, as these projects end up breeding all kinds of horrible pathologies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you may have guessed, &lt;em&gt;The Pruitt\u2013Igoe Myth&lt;/em&gt; fights back against these assumptions. The main thrust of their argument is that complaining about the architecture completely ignores the socioeconomic and demographic factors that led to the most immediate problems. The Federal Housing Act provided money for construction, but not for maintenance; it was assumed that maintenance costs would be paid for out of rents. However, the project had been built based on projections that the population of St. Louis would rise over the coming decades. The population of the city itself ended up decreasing from a high of 850,000 in 1950 to only about 620,000 in 1970, fueled by increasing suburbanization. Accordingly, the project had a high vacancy rate from day one, and the money the housing authority was relying on for maintenance never materialized. As the maintenance backlog increased and the city population decreased, the budget went into a death spiral from which it couldn&amp;#39;t recover. Meanwhile, a declining population meant that housing in more desirable areas was becoming available at low prices, so the project, which was originally intended to be a mix of low and middle income residents, ended up only attracting those who had nowhere else to go. It also touches on ancillary issues like racism, lack of policing, Federal housing policy, etc., but it doesn&amp;#39;t go into them in too great of detail. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does it succeed in making its thesis? Sort of. The theory is plausible on its face, and it certainly explains why the project failed so soon. The problem is that similar projects were tried in practically every major American city, and there isn&amp;#39;t one anyone can point to as a success. Some of these places did last well into the 2000s, but the film doesn&amp;#39;t examine any of them to see if their problems were due to similar factors. Anecdotally speaking, Pittsburgh&amp;#39;s housing projects supposedly didn&amp;#39;t get bad until the mid-&amp;#39;80s, but this is coming from residents and not statistics. Again, these problems were also supposedly exacerbated by lack of maintenance, so it&amp;#39;s hard to say whether the producers of the film are on to something. One crucial distinction here, though, is that most of Pittsburgh&amp;#39;s housing projects are and were low rises, and there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be any correlation between how bad a project is and how big the building is. This is in contrast to the complaints of the art critics and some of the social scientists, who argued that low-rise developments were inherently superior because they were better integrated into the existing community. The counterargument here is that Pittsburgh&amp;#39;s low-rises weren&amp;#39;t integrated into the community at all\u2014they were usually places on isolated hilltops or in ravines, and often had only one way in and out. So I don&amp;#39;t know what to make of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other issue is that all this discussion about modernism and art critics\u2014it&amp;#39;s not in the film, I just happen to be familiar with it. This is the film&amp;#39;s biggest flaw; there&amp;#39;s a theory on why the project failed but no discussion of the theory behind why it was supposed to work or in-depth examination of the criticisms of that theory once the failure became apparent. Instead we get mostly reminiscences from former residents interspersed with a few comments from a social scientist. There&amp;#39;s certainly no examination of the counterarguments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I wanted to write this up here is because the film&amp;#39;s central thesis is intriguing in light of our current housing crisis and homelessness problem. I was riding my bike along the Riverfront trails in Pittsburgh last weekend and I noticed that tents lined the path wherever there was room for them. The previous mayor had a lax attitude toward homeless enforcement but this was different; the tents were well-kept and the people living in them didn&amp;#39;t really look homeless. There was no evidence of drinking or drug use other than the occasional beer, and one ten&amp;#39;s door was open and the inside was reasonably organized. It should also be mentioned that vagrancy downtown was a problem during the Peduto administration but it&amp;#39;s not nearly as bad now, so there&amp;#39;s obviously some additional enforcement going on. I found out later that the people living in these tents have housing vouchers from the county nut there&amp;#39;s nowhere to put them, so they were given tents and permission to set them up until they find apartments. For most of my life, I had been inclined to agree with most of the experts, that public housing was a bad idea for all the usual reasons. But if the result of relying on Section 8 and affordable set asides in market-rate developments just leads to a housing shortage, is it really worse than the alternative? Large projects may be bad, but it&amp;#39;s probably better than sleeping on the street. Furthermore, are they inherently bad, or only bad because of mismanagement and failure to deal with vacancies? These are tough questions, but unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;The Pruitt\u2013Igoe Myth&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t answer them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikelhsn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1660583309.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wos3do", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": "991bceb0-301f-11e9-a749-0ed81f530880", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ike8dlh", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ike8dlh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "MelodicBerries", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660578203.0, "send_replies": false, "parent_id": "t3_wos3do", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_40utrd39", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Is there any serious argument against a free market in human organs if you're a libertarian?
