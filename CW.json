['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 29, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_x0hc17", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661753708.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

The school has special facilities meant to provide opportunities for students who show achievement and passion for STEM and who will eventually pursue careers in science, engineering, or medicine. It has courses in things like artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics, DNA science, and machine learning. It also has several labs where students can do research projects. It was [ranked](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/virginia/districts/fairfax-county-public-schools/thomas-jefferson-high-school-for-science-and-technology-20461) as the best school in the country in 2022. \n\nUntil recently, TJ admitted students through a competitive process similar to the college admissions process in which prior academic achievement, teacher recommendations, and an exam similar to the SAT played a major role. The school had a low proportion of black and Hispanic students who were admitted, and this was long a complaint of left-wing activists who advocate reforms to the admissions process so that more non-Asian minorities would be admitted. In particular, they blamed the admissions exam for eliminating most such students from consideration.\n\nIn 2020, those activists got their way. The school board voted to eliminate the admissions test in [October 2020](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/thomas-jefferson-high-admissions-change/2020/10/07/0a1f8faa-08a7-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html) and later that year made other reforms to the admissions process, including setting minimum quotas for admission at the middle school level and adding \"experience factors\" to the process. The [class of students](https://www.fcps.edu/news/tjhsst-offers-admission-550-students-broadens-access-students-who-have-aptitude-stem) admitted the next year went from being 4.52% black and Hispanic to 18.36%. \n\nAn advocacy group opposed to the 2020 changes [sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_for_TJ_v._Fairfax_County_School_Board), alleging the changes discriminated against Asian Americans, whose share of admitted students decreased from 73.05% to 54.36%. The case is currently pending before the appeals court.\n\nOne thing I realized while I was researching this is that there actually still is a test that influences your probability of admission to TJ. One of the \"experience factors\" that increases a student's odds of being admitted in the [new admissions process](https://www.fcps.edu/registration/thomas-jefferson-high-school-science-and-technology-admissions/tjhsst-freshman) is whether they are an English Language Learner (ELL). An [ELL is a student](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/explaining-ell-status-english.pdf) who has extra support learning English in school. How do schools identify which students need extra support learning English?\n\nWell, there's a test. Schools administer an English skills test and students who perform poorly on it are identified as ELL and offered extra instruction in special classes for ELLs. \n\nWhat this means for TJ is that a student's chance of being admitted to an elite school for the academically excellent is *increased* if they perform *poorly* enough on evaluations of their language skills.\n\nThe reason the school board added this consideration is obvious: The [large majority (78%)](https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/el-characteristics/index.html#four) of ELLs are Hispanic, so preferring ELLs in the admissions process is a way to increase the proportion of Hispanics admitted without needing to add race to the admissions process explicitly (which would be more easily challenged legally). Asians make up 11% of ELLs too, but it's notable that Hispanics outnumber Asians among ELLs by 7:1 but only by about 3:1 in the general population ([6.1% vs. 18.9%](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045221)). A lot of Asian kids speak two languages but their parents made sure they were good enough with English that they don't need any special instruction.\n\nThis is just... so backwards. I don't think it would be fair to prefer students who speak more than one language in admission to TJ. But I could see an argument for it: Students who successfully learned a second language and succeeded enough to be equally or almost equally academically impressive as students who speak English natively have done something really impressive, now that they've mastered the lingua franca, they'll probably shine even brighter. In fact, this describes a large proportion of the students admitted to TJ under the old process. But that's not what they're doing with this new process. They're specifically preferring the students who were *least* successful at learning the new language, the ones who struggled the *most* with it. \n\nOn top of that, immigrant families who were responsible and ~~paid off their student loans~~ taught their kids English fluency and saved the taxpayer-funded school system the extra burden of dealing with kids who don't know English are punished, while the ones who depended on the government for that are rewarded.\n\nWell, expect an increase in enrollment in ELL programs in Fairfax County of kids who seem to be speak pretty good English most of the time.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_imgejsp", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s Still a TJ Test, Actually&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology\"&gt;Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt; is a magnet STEM-focused high school in Northern Virginia established in 1985. The school has special facilities meant to provide opportunities for students who show achievement and passion for STEM and who will eventually pursue careers in science, engineering, or medicine. It has courses in things like artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics, DNA science, and machine learning. It also has several labs where students can do research projects. It was &lt;a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/virginia/districts/fairfax-county-public-schools/thomas-jefferson-high-school-for-science-and-technology-20461\"&gt;ranked&lt;/a&gt; as the best school in the country in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until recently, TJ admitted students through a competitive process similar to the college admissions process in which prior academic achievement, teacher recommendations, and an exam similar to the SAT played a major role. The school had a low proportion of black and Hispanic students who were admitted, and this was long a complaint of left-wing activists who advocate reforms to the admissions process so that more non-Asian minorities would be admitted. In particular, they blamed the admissions exam for eliminating most such students from consideration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2020, those activists got their way. The school board voted to eliminate the admissions test in &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/thomas-jefferson-high-admissions-change/2020/10/07/0a1f8faa-08a7-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html\"&gt;October 2020&lt;/a&gt; and later that year made other reforms to the admissions process, including setting minimum quotas for admission at the middle school level and adding &amp;quot;experience factors&amp;quot; to the process. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.fcps.edu/news/tjhsst-offers-admission-550-students-broadens-access-students-who-have-aptitude-stem\"&gt;class of students&lt;/a&gt; admitted the next year went from being 4.52% black and Hispanic to 18.36%. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An advocacy group opposed to the 2020 changes &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_for_TJ_v._Fairfax_County_School_Board\"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt;, alleging the changes discriminated against Asian Americans, whose share of admitted students decreased from 73.05% to 54.36%. The case is currently pending before the appeals court.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I realized while I was researching this is that there actually still is a test that influences your probability of admission to TJ. One of the &amp;quot;experience factors&amp;quot; that increases a student&amp;#39;s odds of being admitted in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.fcps.edu/registration/thomas-jefferson-high-school-science-and-technology-admissions/tjhsst-freshman\"&gt;new admissions process&lt;/a&gt; is whether they are an English Language Learner (ELL).

It's not just the oft-ridiculed climbing walls and lazy rivers - I'm talking about the basics, the features of college that predate the crazy expansion of the last thirty (?) years: access to first-rate facilities, people paid to serve you, people paid to do your dishes, and on top of all that, excellent event programming so that, if your studies ever bore you, you'll still be stimulated.\n\nUltimately, I'm shocked that so many early reactions to this involve a shrug, or (worse) approval of the policy, seemingly based on the sympathetic profile of a minority of beneficiaries, though maybe that's my naivete. Another writer here (responding to Trace's post, I think) wrote convincingly that people probably just conceive of this as \"free college\" rather than debt. That's an idea that's probably more popular than \"free country clubs\" (and definitely more popular than \"free country clubs for the rich\"), but I'm not sure it deserves the support.\n\n\\[0\\] People that have some college but no degree already do moderately better than people with a high-school diploma, [per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm), or [this Northeastern University study](https://www.northeastern.edu/bachelors-completion/news/average-salary-by-education-level), or any of the dozens of links that pop up when you start to research education and income.\n\n\\[1\\] \"More than a quarter\" = 30% \\* Krugman's \"43 million Americans\", then round it up.\n\n\\[2\\] Of course, there the educational experience.

The people do not flourish, their businesses do not succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think many people would stand for a country club relief program for both groups, and I don&amp;#39;t think the New York Times would publish multiple defenses of the program in the space of a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This comparison might not sound fair, especially if you went to community college or commuter school (to say nothing of a for-profit college), but I promise it is directionally accurate.[2]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At liberal arts colleges, most private universities, and flagship state schools (at least), you get unbelievable amenities for your money. It&amp;#39;s not just the oft-ridiculed climbing walls and lazy rivers - I&amp;#39;m talking about the basics, the features of college that predate the crazy expansion of the last thirty (?) years: access to first-rate facilities, people paid to serve you, people paid to do your dishes, and on top of all that, excellent event programming so that, if your studies ever bore you, you&amp;#39;ll still be stimulated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I&amp;#39;m shocked that so many early reactions to this involve a shrug, or (worse) approval of the policy, seemingly based on the sympathetic profile of a minority of beneficiaries, though maybe that&amp;#39;s my naivete. Another writer here (responding to Trace&amp;#39;s post, I think) wrote convincingly that people probably just conceive of this as &amp;quot;free college&amp;quot; rather than debt. That&amp;#39;s an idea that&amp;#39;s probably more popular than &amp;quot;free country clubs&amp;quot; (and definitely more popular than &amp;quot;free country clubs for the rich&amp;quot;), but I&amp;#39;m not sure it deserves the support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[0] People that have some college but no degree already do moderately better than people with a high-school diploma, &lt;a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm\"&gt;per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"https://www.northeastern.edu/bachelors-completion/news/average-salary-by-education-level\"&gt;this Northeastern University study&lt;/a&gt;, or any of the dozens of links that pop up when you start to research education and income.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[1] &amp;quot;More than a quarter&amp;quot; = 30% * Krugman&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;43 million Americans&amp;quot;, then round it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[2] Of course, there the educational experience. But I must say, this is easy to overstate, especially if you&amp;#39;ve been &lt;a href=\"https://substack.com/profile/12666725-freddie-deboer\"&gt;Fred-pilled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/ime085j/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1661868803.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_x0hc17", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_imcpyav", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "imcpyav", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "sonyaellenmann", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1661837875.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_x0hc17", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_sxjr0", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I came across a [fascinating blog post about dating and sexual preferences](https://blaqueinthecity.com/2022/05/21/dating-preferences-and-the-painful-burden-of-being-less-preferred-but-always-desired-2/) written by a black trans woman, drawing on her personal experiences in the dating market. She's clearly coming from a woke perspective \u2014 \"I only date people on the left; I guess that makes me 'rightphobic', but I'm okay with that,\" lol. But she's also far more nuanced than your typical Twitter SJW (is there a less-dated noun for That Type? anyway)\n\nSome notable excerpts, emphasis added by me:\n\n&gt; **A society that rejects transgender people\u2019s bodies as valid is also one that deeply fetishizes them.** As a trans woman, most of the men I\u2019d describe as \u201cchasers\u201d are men who get off on the social taboo of sleeping with transgender women and the fact that no one knows what they\u2019re doing. Partially because they\u2019re ashamed, but also because the secret excites them. Their secrecy also maintains their chances with cis women, who tend to be their preference. These men know that a lot of cis women would be repulsed if they knew they were attracted to transgender women, and this is the excuse they give for treating trans women how they do. Unfortunately, most chasers are in the position they\u2019re in because they saw a trans woman who challenged their understanding of self, and they slowly but surely developed the habit of secretly consuming transgender pornography and contacting transgender women. They were curious, but then they learned they can prey on a group of people who are so used to not being preferred that they are often willing to go the extra mile to satisfy those who have privilege over them. **In fact, because transgender women know that they are rarely preferred over cis women, the attention of cis men is very validating to transgender women who are in an insecure phase of life. It\u2019s not uncommon for transgender women to feel flattered by the affection of a man who identifies as heterosexual because, to them the expression of attraction is also a validation of them as women.** So, you have a group of heterosexual men who might otherwise be unimpressive whose inherent quality is now seen as impressive long before anything else is established. Some men become intoxicated by the idea that all they have to do is say they\u2019re straight and gorgeous transgender women, who haven\u2019t quite found their worth, will overlook all of their flaws, all of the reasons other women have rejected them all to feel more proximity to their privilege. This often leads to some very toxic and abusive dynamics that are very stressful for transgender women. **These men are actively attracted to them and choose to mistreat them because they are transgender. For me, that will always feel more transphobic than someone simply saying no to me.**\n\n---\n\n&gt; Who men tend to prefer becomes very obvious when you are polyamorous. **I\u2019ve dated men of various racial backgrounds who all denied they had a preference but were often primary partnered to cis white women. If they weren\u2019t when I met them, almost all of them left or paused their relationships with me because of a new, cis white partner.** Removing monogamy from the conversation, allows for these things to be seen more clearly because a monogamous person could easily argue that it\u2019s a coincidence that they just so happened to fall in love with someone who fits the idealized beauty standard. When you live in a very diverse city and all of your partners are that idealized beauty standard, it\u2019s obvious you have a preference; but these people will deny it. **If you went to a Polyamory social and lined up every woman who was primary partnered, most of them will be cis and white; that\u2019s not a coincidence. You\u2019ll notice the \u201csecondary\u201d partners tend to be a bit darker skinned, often more queer, sometimes less cis than their primary. Often times, men primary their \u201cpreference\u201d and keep their curiosities or the less socially acceptable partners as secondaries. To this day, I have never met a cis man primary partnered to a transgender woman with a cis woman as a secondary, but I have been the transgender secondary partner for many polyamorous men in LA.** If you were to ask these men if they had a preference, they would absolutely say no, but you see their preferences clear as day and you notice how when new women of color come to the event, they don\u2019t get swarmed with attention the same way a white girl would. None of these socially aware, left leaning people want to say that they have a preference, but they do. But being a bit graceful, another aspect of \u201cpreference\u201d that isn\u2019t often discussed is that sometimes their \u201cpreference\u201d really isn\u2019t even their own. \n\nThere are a couple poly people here, right? Hoping you can comment on whether her perception matches yours as well. Not because I don't believe her \u2014 sounds very plausible \u2014 but because scene dynamics can vary, regionally and otherwise, so I'm curious.\n\nOverall, the territory she treads in this essay is familiar \u2014 it's the madonna-whore dichotomy, the difference between a good-time girl and the one you take home to mama. I can imagine it's very frustrating to be sorted into the \"whore\" category sheerly because of your demographic. Last excerpt:\n\n&gt; Maybe it\u2019s because I date men, but my experience with being less preferred has often been that I\u2019m placed in a position where my intimate partners mistreat me and expect me to stay because they know I\u2019m less preferred. It took me a while to understand that white men like my ex who very performatively trash white women to uplift women of color are doing so out of bitterness and a history of rejection. A lot of times when these men have low self-esteem, they\u2019ll pursue someone they know they have more privilege than to prey on theirs instead. **Through our relationship, I knew he had insecurities, but I didn\u2019t make the connection that those insecurities meant that he was intimidated by the white women he preferred and that he saw me as easier to connect with because I existed outside of most people\u2019s preferences.** When he spoke about white women, it was always about how they were too prissy or high maintenance. He\u2019d complain about women who had standards and were willing to say no and not settle for less. In retrospect, I can see that he knew he\u2019d get away with relying on me financially because perhaps subconsciously, I did buy into the idea that a relationship with him was flattering, and I didn\u2019t want to walk away from it. Chasers will often trash cis women in a similar way. They\u2019ll talk about how much more feminine trans women are and how bitchy and stuck up cis women are. It\u2019s all constructed to prey on the insecurities they know society promotes within you. These are often relationships where I\u2019m expected to do a lot and to put up with more shit than the women they prefer. I cannot even believe that I spent all of this money in my last relationship providing for a man who is far more privileged than I\u2019ll ever be, but that\u2019s often the position you end up in. **These men often expect you to do more labor for them because you do not have the same bargaining power as their preference. I\u2019ve seen men who were broke for me, be rich for their preference.** These relationships always left me feeling depleted and the only reason I speak so much about them is that they\u2019ve left me with lasting trauma that has very viciously affected me and made me so fearful of men and their true desires. For that reason, it\u2019s hard for me to hear conversations that attribute bigotry to someone rejecting someone they do not prefer. **I struggle to buy into the idea that because a man is attracted to me, he\u2019s less bigoted than the men who reject me on the basis of who I am and leave me alone. I wish so many of my former intimate partners simply left me alone and pursued their preferences until one stuck. I wish they\u2019d stop using me as a stop gap between relationships with the kind of women they prefer.** I wish I could stop being in relationships where I\u2019m expected to settle for less, because of who I am. I cannot remember every man who\u2019s rejected me for being a trans woman, but to this day, I feel the pain of being so intimate with men who mistreated me because I\u2019m a transgender woman.\n\nI definitely sympathize with the issue of having your low self-esteem used as manipulation leverage within an intimate relationship, by someone who is doing that shit because they too have low self-esteem (whether the self-assessment, by either party, is warranted or not).\n\nAnother theme of the essay, not emphasized as much in the longer passages that I quoted, is the degree to which desire is culturally mediated. She writes, \"What I dislike about this discourse is that on one hand it acknowledges that the type of people we're attracted to is linked to our socialization, but it downplays the depth of that socialization.\"\n\nAs for myself, I don't really have a point here. I thought her perspective \u2014 her inside view of dating as a black trans woman \u2014 was very interesting.

What does this actually mean? It is a sentiment I encounter often. Including on this subreddit in the course of a discussion a few days/weeks ago (most articulately elucidated by /u/FCfromSSC). \n\nIt usually comes up in arguments between Christian and non-Christian right-wingers. e.g:\n\n\"Christianity is a cringe cuck Asiatic soy religion\" \n\n\"Actually Christianity is heckin based and redpilled and built western civilization.\" \n\nI disagree with the proposition, or at least, I am pretty sure I do. \n\nI think \"Christianity built western civilization\" can be interpreted a number of ways. \n\nFirst, and least charitably, it could be taken to mean that Christianity has had a very great influence on western civilization over the course of the past, say, fifteen centuries. This is undeniable. There would be no Gothic cathedrals, no *Divine Comedy* without Christianity. Sure. But I don't think this is what is meant by \"Christianity built western civilization.\" Because this is a very tautological and uninteresting interpretation of the proposition. If not for Christianity, European civilization would not bear a Christian stamp. Sure. So what?\n\nThere is a stronger interpretation, which is that Christianity added something (or some*things*) to European civilization which, while not explicitly Christian, it would not have had without Christianity. For example, it sometimes said that the scientific method is rooted in a Christian worldview (I happen to think this is absurd). However, I could still probably agree with this. European civilization would certainly have been very different without Christianity. Fun as counterfactuals are, we will never know precisely *how* it would have been different, but it certainly would have been, and many of these differences would probably have been subtle and not immediately tied to the absence of Christianity. \n\nThe strongest interpretation of the proposition, and the one I believe its defenders are adhering to, is something like, \"European civilization is/was *great* and its *greatness* is entirely or largely owed to Christianity.\" This is the interpretation I strongly *disagree* with. \n\nIt depends on what you think is (or was) *great* about European civilization. If you are a Christian, and you say, \"Christianity is true, and therefore a civilization that exemplifies Christian morals and virtue is great,\" then we have a very deep disagreement, because I *don't* think Christianity is true. The argument will have to be suspended while we dig down to a deeper level and argue about the truth of Christianity. \n\nBut most defenders of the proposition don't tend to argue so bluntly.

One might as easily say, \"well, the west has been liberal democratic for two centuries, now.

What does this actually mean? It is a sentiment I encounter often. Including on this subreddit in the course of a discussion a few days/weeks ago (most articulately elucidated by &lt;a href=\"/u/FCfromSSC\"&gt;/u/FCfromSSC&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It usually comes up in arguments between Christian and non-Christian right-wingers. e.g:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Christianity is a cringe cuck Asiatic soy religion&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Actually Christianity is heckin based and redpilled and built western civilization.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I disagree with the proposition, or at least, I am pretty sure I do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think &amp;quot;Christianity built western civilization&amp;quot; can be interpreted a number of ways. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, and least charitably, it could be taken to mean that Christianity has had a very great influence on western civilization over the course of the past, say, fifteen centuries. This is undeniable. There would be no Gothic cathedrals, no &lt;em&gt;Divine Comedy&lt;/em&gt; without Christianity. Sure. But I don&amp;#39;t think this is what is meant by &amp;quot;Christianity built western civilization.&amp;quot; Because this is a very tautological and uninteresting interpretation of the proposition. If not for Christianity, European civilization would not bear a Christian stamp. Sure. So what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a stronger interpretation, which is that Christianity added something (or some&lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt;) to European civilization which, while not explicitly Christian, it would not have had without Christianity. For example, it sometimes said that the scientific method is rooted in a Christian worldview (I happen to think this is absurd). However, I could still probably agree with this. European civilization would certainly have been very different without Christianity. Fun as counterfactuals are, we will never know precisely &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it would have been different, but it certainly would have been, and many of these differences would probably have been subtle and not immediately tied to the absence of Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The strongest interpretation of the proposition, and the one I believe its defenders are adhering to, is something like, &amp;quot;European civilization is/was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; and its &lt;em&gt;greatness&lt;/em&gt; is entirely or largely owed to Christianity.&amp;quot; This is the interpretation I strongly &lt;em&gt;disagree&lt;/em&gt; with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It depends on what you think is (or was) &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; about European civilization. If you are a Christian, and you say, &amp;quot;Christianity is true, and therefore a civilization that exemplifies Christian morals and virtue is great,&amp;quot; then we have a very deep disagreement, because I &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; think Christianity is true. The argument will have to be suspended while we dig down to a deeper level and argue about the truth of Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But most defenders of the proposition don&amp;#39;t tend to argue so bluntly. In my experience, they attempt to find common ground with the non-Christian RWer by which they can persuade them that the greatness of European civilization, agreed upon by both parties, can be credited to Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what made European civilization great?

I don\u2019t normally enjoy writing about this kind of piece because of how heated people can get, but I found this interesting enough that I\u2019ll give it a go.\n\nTl;dr: Likes:  \n-\tTrump, the president \n-\tThe right\u2019s interpretation of Russiagate  \n-\tRepublicans  \n-\tJoe Manchin and Stephen Breyer  \nDislikes:  \n-\tTrump, the person  \n-\tProgressives (unclear to me how wide a net this casts)  \n-\tPolitical tribalism  \n\nBarr tells a few stories that echo what has come out about the Trump administration in a number of books and other sources. Stories like this one:\n\n&gt;AG BARR: It was on June 1 when the president was bellowing at a number of his cabinet secretaries, especially the military guys\u2014the secretary and chairman of the joint chiefs. He was calling all of us \u201cfucking losers\u201d at the top of his lungs. \nOr this one, where he tried to resign over the allegations Trump was making of election fraud:\n&gt;AG BARR: He was in a little dining room that adjoins the Oval Office. He was as furious as I\u2019d ever seen him. He confronted me and said, \u201cDid you say this to the AP?\u201d And I said, \u201cI did. Because it was the truth.\u201d I went over some of the allegations. He said there was plenty of evidence of fraud. I explained in some detail why the allegations didn\u2019t fly. I told him that there were only five or six weeks to challenge a presidential election because the Constitution requires the Electoral College to meet at a certain date and he didn\u2019t have much time. He\u2019d already wasted five of your six weeks with this crazy stuff about the Dominion machines. He\u2019d wheeled out this clown show of lawyers that no reputable lawyer is willing to work with.  \n&gt;I said, \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re unhappy with me. I\u2019m going to tender my resignation.\u201d And he slammed the table. Everyone jumped. And he said, \u201cAccepted.\u201d So I said OK and left. I was getting into my car right outside the White House and all of a sudden, people started pounding on the windows. It was late at night and raining, so it was sort of this eerie thing. The president sent Cipollone, another White House lawyer, out there, to retrieve me and tell me \u201cNevermind, he\u2019s not going to fire you, and would you come back in?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don't think there's any use to going back in tonight. I\u2019m going to go home. But we can talk about it in the morning.\u201d \n\nI suppose it depends how much credence you lend to his version of events over Trump\u2019s. Barr genuinely seems to like what Trump did while in office, though, if that moves your needle towards believing him. I won\u2019t link those quotes due to space concerns. He also doesn\u2019t lend any credence to the election fraud theories:\n\n&gt;AG BARR: I was somewhat demoralized that he was leaving office this way. The left says, \u201cOh, you said all these nice things about him in your resignation.\u201d But I felt that what he should do was focus on all his achievements and leave with dignity. Whether he thought there was fraud or not, he had his day in court and he lost.  \n&gt;So I was demoralized that he was going out the way he was. I thought it was very unfair to all the people, especially the younger people, who had worked in the administration. It hurt them getting jobs and it also hurt the Republican Party, which I thought up until then, could take the high ground as the party of law and order.  \n&gt;I would say it [the January 6th riot] was an effort to intimidate Congress and the vice president. I haven\u2019t heard words from the president that I would consider incitement under the law. That\u2019s a very high bar because of our First Amendment, and it should be a high bar. But I did feel that he was morally responsible for it because he led these people to believe that something could happen on Capitol Hill that would reverse the election. That there\u2019s something they could do involving pressuring the vice president and Congress that would overturn the election. \n\nBarr also says a number of things about politics that make me think that compromise and a rapprochement are possible. Perhaps I\u2019m projecting, but he seems to argue against reactionary politics and towards something more constructive:\n\n&gt;Something I\u2019m pretty tired of from the right is the constant pandering to outrage. The picking and picking at the scab without trying to channel those feelings in a constructive direction. In my opinion, Ronald Reagan was a great populist not because he followed the frustrated instincts and the outrage of the people, but because he channeled it and was constructive with it\u2026We have these institutions that need reform. The first step is to win an election with a decisive majority that allows you to put a program into effect and fix some of these problems going forward. That is not done by just throwing fuel on the fire of outrage on one side of the equation while the other side does the same thing on their side\u2026I think we should basically try to persuade people. People like Youngkin, the Governor of Virginia, have shown that the Republican Party is a potential majority party.  \n&gt;The problem with Trump is that it\u2019s all about running a base election. Whip up your base, get them all upset and outraged, and turn them out at the polls. Both sides do that. That is a prescription for continued hostility and demoralization of the country. The first side to break out of that will do so by restoring politics to what it should be, which is the politics of trying to capture a majority of the people through persuasion and with a decisive enough majority to change things\u2026I say to the people that want to make America great again, \u201cWhat will it take to do that?\u201d You don\u2019t do it just by making your base madder and madder.  \n\nAnd yet, at the same time, the way he talks about liberals is depressing:\n\n&gt;although we\u2019ve been sort of harping on the warts of Trumpism, I think the greatest threat to the country is the radical progressive movement and what it\u2019s degenerated into. In 2016, had there been another Democratic administration, I was concerned that we\u2019d have dug an even deeper hole that would be much harder to get out of. I think Trump did serve a historic purpose: He was sort of the wrecking ball and against progressive excess. People were mad about it, and they wanted a no-nonsense person who would be a wrecking ball, and he did that. What I\u2019m saying now is that we need something different moving forward. I give him credit for identifying people\u2019s frustrations and being willing to call out some of the progressive excess that other people were cowering about then.  \n\n&gt;If we\u2019ve left it behind, I don't think this ends well for the country. I don't see that this leads to any future for the country. I think we have to return to that if we\u2019re going to have a future. I put this on the doorstep of the radical progressives as their responsibility. They\u2019re the ones who have sharply shifted. The political model before this was the liberal democratic spectrum where you have right and left, but we\u2019re all within the liberal, democratic, Anglo-American political tradition.  \n\n&gt;What we\u2019ve moved to is a bipolar system that\u2019s more typical of revolutionary countries, where you have a party like the Marxists or some other totalitarian party trying to take power. It\u2019s all or nothing and anything goes. It\u2019s war by other means. That\u2019s where we are, and it doesn\u2019t end well.  \n\n&gt;Those of us who are traditional conservatives, Reagan conservatives\u2013\u2013I grew up on Bill Buckley and so forth\u2013\u2013believe in the Anglo-American system of politics. We have a First Amendment that allows citizens to debate and come to some consensus for the public good. One of the things that bothers me is that people talk about democracy and the threat to democracy. Well, what did the framers think was the threat to democracy? In Federalist 10, Madison says it\u2019s when the majority uses democracy to oppress the minority. When someone takes a transient 51% majority and tries to ram things down the throat of the other 49%, and now we\u2019re finding ourselves sort of oscillating between those two worlds. Get 51 votes, good: Obamacare. You have 51 votes and you shove it down people\u2019s throats. Whereas the institutions that we\u2019ve had before this were meant to require some form of consensus and incremental change. They allowed people to build up some consensus for an approach, and things moved slowly. That\u2019s not good enough for revolutionaries, who want to tear things down or change things instantaneously. I think that\u2019s the basic challenge we face right now.\n\nautomod_multipart_lockme", "edited": 1661788919.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_im9lflo", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lost in the shuffle last week was an interview between &lt;a href=\"https://www.commonsense.news/p/bill-barr-calls-bullsht\"&gt;Trump\u2019s AG Bill Barr&lt;/a&gt; and Bari Weiss.

Stories like this one:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;AG BARR: It was on June 1 when the president was bellowing at a number of his cabinet secretaries, especially the military guys\u2014the secretary and chairman of the joint chiefs. He was calling all of us \u201cfucking losers\u201d at the top of his lungs. \nOr this one, where he tried to resign over the allegations Trump was making of election fraud:\nAG BARR: He was in a little dining room that adjoins the Oval Office. He was as furious as I\u2019d ever seen him. He confronted me and said, \u201cDid you say this to the AP?\u201d And I said, \u201cI did. Because it was the truth.\u201d I went over some of the allegations. He said there was plenty of evidence of fraud. I explained in some detail why the allegations didn\u2019t fly. I told him that there were only five or six weeks to challenge a presidential election because the Constitution requires the Electoral College to meet at a certain date and he didn\u2019t have much time. He\u2019d already wasted five of your six weeks with this crazy stuff about the Dominion machines. He\u2019d wheeled out this clown show of lawyers that no reputable lawyer is willing to work with.&lt;br/&gt;\nI said, \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re unhappy with me. I\u2019m going to tender my resignation.\u201d And he slammed the table. Everyone jumped. And he said, \u201cAccepted.\u201d So I said OK and left. I was getting into my car right outside the White House and all of a sudden, people started pounding on the windows. It was late at night and raining, so it was sort of this eerie thing. The president sent Cipollone, another White House lawyer, out there, to retrieve me and tell me \u201cNevermind, he\u2019s not going to fire you, and would you come back in?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any use to going back in tonight. I\u2019m going to go home. But we can talk about it in the morning.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it depends how much credence you lend to his version of events over Trump\u2019s. Barr genuinely seems to like what Trump did while in office, though, if that moves your needle towards believing him. I won\u2019t link those quotes due to space concerns. He also doesn\u2019t lend any credence to the election fraud theories:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;AG BARR: I was somewhat demoralized that he was leaving office this way. The left says, \u201cOh, you said all these nice things about him in your resignation.\u201d But I felt that what he should do was focus on all his achievements and leave with dignity. Whether he thought there was fraud or not, he had his day in court and he lost.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo I was demoralized that he was going out the way he was. I thought it was very unfair to all the people, especially the younger people, who had worked in the administration. It hurt them getting jobs and it also hurt the Republican Party, which I thought up until then, could take the high ground as the party of law and order.&lt;br/&gt;\nI would say it [the January 6th riot] was an effort to intimidate Congress and the vice president. I haven\u2019t heard words from the president that I would consider incitement under the law. That\u2019s a very high bar because of our First Amendment, and it should be a high bar. But I did feel that he was morally responsible for it because he led these people to believe that something could happen on Capitol Hill that would reverse the election. That there\u2019s something they could do involving pressuring the vice president and Congress that would overturn the election. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barr also says a number of things about politics that make me think that compromise and a rapprochement are possible. Perhaps I\u2019m projecting, but he seems to argue against reactionary politics and towards something more constructive:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Something I\u2019m pretty tired of from the right is the constant pandering to outrage. The picking and picking at the scab without trying to channel those feelings in a constructive direction. In my opinion, Ronald Reagan was a great populist not because he followed the frustrated instincts and the outrage of the people, but because he channeled it and was constructive with it\u2026We have these institutions that need reform. The first step is to win an election with a decisive majority that allows you to put a program into effect and fix some of these problems going forward. That is not done by just throwing fuel on the fire of outrage on one side of the equation while the other side does the same thing on their side\u2026I think we should basically try to persuade people.

It stirred quite a blowback, and a &lt;a href=\"https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/08/28/is-maternal-instinct-a-misogynistic-myth/#comments\"&gt;rebuttal&lt;/a&gt; from Jerry Coyne.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think its worth discussing why any archetype of maternity is frowned upon as regressive and demeaning towards women. There seems to be a section in hyper progressive academia that thinks that gender roles need to be reversed to &amp;quot;right historical wrongs&amp;quot;, in society, in film, etc. Maybe its just votebank politics, maybe corporations want to discourage family priorities through mass media. I&amp;#39;m not quite sure how this division of consumer demographics between the sexes will end, especially at a time when birth rates are falling and the American establishment is realising that its global unipolarity has ended with an ascendant China, an uppity India and a vengeful Russia on the horizon.
