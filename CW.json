Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of July 18, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_w1s5b7", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 41, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658124910.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

I  know jackshit about any of the life sciences.

They are highly chaotic, non linear and dynamic. There are agents, feedback loops, gains, etc. Much like the [economic system](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2017/06/yudkowsky_on_my.html), there is a [delicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka\u2013Volterra_equations) [balance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320716301185). And this not that insightful at all. Anyone who read learned about the food chain can figure this out, with a bit of thought. This might be the one topic where I diverge significantly from my fellow libertarians and right wingers. Given the the delicate balance, I am more sympathetic to laws that minimize externalities towards the natural world. \n\nThere are plenty of object level arguments on why the environment/ecosystems should be preserved. I won't go into those because they are signal boosted plentifully. I want to have a discussion on the aesthetics of it.\n\n#### The Asian Monsoon \n\nWhen I was a child, I used to live in a country that gets the [Asian monsoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nstixjMS7A&amp;ab_channel=Geodiode). For the uninitiated, it is rain of the likes you have (probably) never experienced before. I'm talking more rain in a month than most European and North American cities get in a years. \n\nIn the countryside you would be immersed in nature just leaving your house. You could barely go for a walk without stumbling into a large (4 foot long) monitor lizard, snakes, turtles, frogs and bugs, so many bugs. And I am not understating this, you could seriously just go and find any one of those animals any day. \n\nA significant part of my childhood consisted of just going out into the edges of the jungle and observing all the critters and sometimes trapping them in plastic jars.  Every day felt like an adventure because I wouldn't know what I would come across the next day. Everything felt for a lack of a better word 'alive'.\n\nUnfortunately it seems like kids a few decades down might not be able to experience that any more. The [Asian monsoon](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220517-the-uncertain-fate-of-asias-monsoons) is drying up. So many of these critters depended on the rain and the vegetation it brought. I would consider it a huge loss to all the kids who would have been like me, if that part of the world dries up. \n\n#### The Windshield phenomenon\n\nThe [Windshield phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windshield_phenomenon) is the observation that less bugs splatter into the windshields of cars than they used to. There are countless anecdotes from Europe and North America about this phenomenon happening over time. \n\nYes anecdata has its shortcomings but it really does seem like the World is [losing its critters](https://e360.yale.edu/features/insect_numbers_declining_why_it_matters).  The world has lost 70% of its insect biomass in the last 50 years. I don't know why, but for some reason, finding out about this filled me with a sense of sadness that is very hard to describe. It's not that I have empathy towards insects, it's just that the world became a less vibrant place. Less insects means, less other types of plants and animals, because its all linked, obviously. Less natural beauty in the world. \n\nI have visited the forests of North America (North East US) in the summer recently. Ofcourse they are not the same type of forest as the ones I had in my country, but they felt very \"clean\". The forests I grew up with had so many critters that you could hear them crawling around. The forests in North America were quite in comparison. If the windshield phenomenon explains anything, the forests in North America were probably much more lively than they are now, at some time in the near past. \n\nThere are plenty of reasons to believe the causation is anthropogenic. \n\n#### North America\n\nNorth America used to have [buffalo heards](http://www.ozarkbisons.com/aboutbison.php) as far as the eye could see. [Passenger pigeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon) flocks that used to cover the sky. They both don't exist anymore, the latter not at all, the former not at the level it used to. And this is  entirely because of what I would confidently assert as [unadulterated evil](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/05/the-buffalo-killers/482349/). \n\nDid North America in the abstract not lose something great? \n\n#### Europe\n\nEurope lost 60% of its forest cover because of agriculture and development. Thankfully [its recovering](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.ZS?locations=EU). \n\nIt gives me an uneasy feeling ,a sort of \"are we playing with fire\" type of feeling, when we can just wipe out 60% of life in a continent to live ourselves. There's not much more to it, just a passing thought.\n\n\n#### Concluding thoughts\n\nI am well aware that some damage to the enviorment has to be done to progress technologically. We need to mine raw materials to make bridges, cars, and computers. Some of that will ruin some forests and some mountains. I am also well aware that not doing destroying some of nature means terrible living standards forever. I understand all that clear enough.\n\nBut I also think sometimes, what good would having tall buildings and planes means if there are no places to live or go with tall trees and bushes with bugs and lizards. Mountains with tall trees and bushes. And land with mountains. \n\n\"Save the Earth\" is a vacuous phrase. The Earth has been there for billions of years without us and can do fine. Yes, we need the Earth to literally live, but we also need it for other things that make life worth living right? What candle does the tallest building hold to Mt Everest if awe is to be inspired? What candle does a botanical garden hold to the Amazon rain-forest?  Is the NYC skyline more awe inspiring than the Niagara falls? Can any zoo in the world replace seeing lions hunt in the Serengeti? \n\nI don't have enough knowledge to assert if its all doom and gloom and the natural world is inevitibly soon to be gone forever. But I do know that we already lost a fair bit of it, and we are losing it fast.", "edited": 1658613470.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ihddgmx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will you miss the critters?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m making this post inspired by &lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ihatskw/\"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"/u/ZorbaTHut\"&gt;u/ZorbaTHut&lt;/a&gt;.

And I am not understating this, you could seriously just go and find any one of those animals any day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A significant part of my childhood consisted of just going out into the edges of the jungle and observing all the critters and sometimes trapping them in plastic jars.  Every day felt like an adventure because I wouldn&amp;#39;t know what I would come across the next day. Everything felt for a lack of a better word &amp;#39;alive&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it seems like kids a few decades down might not be able to experience that any more. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220517-the-uncertain-fate-of-asias-monsoons\"&gt;Asian monsoon&lt;/a&gt; is drying up. So many of these critters depended on the rain and the vegetation it brought. I would consider it a huge loss to all the kids who would have been like me, if that part of the world dries up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;The Windshield phenomenon&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windshield_phenomenon\"&gt;Windshield phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; is the observation that less bugs splatter into the windshields of cars than they used to. There are countless anecdotes from Europe and North America about this phenomenon happening over time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes anecdata has its shortcomings but it really does seem like the World is &lt;a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/insect_numbers_declining_why_it_matters\"&gt;losing its critters&lt;/a&gt;.  The world has lost 70% of its insect biomass in the last 50 years. I don&amp;#39;t know why, but for some reason, finding out about this filled me with a sense of sadness that is very hard to describe. It&amp;#39;s not that I have empathy towards insects, it&amp;#39;s just that the world became a less vibrant place. Less insects means, less other types of plants and animals, because its all linked, obviously. Less natural beauty in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have visited the forests of North America (North East US) in the summer recently. Ofcourse they are not the same type of forest as the ones I had in my country, but they felt very &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot;. The forests I grew up with had so many critters that you could hear them crawling around. The forests in North America were quite in comparison. If the windshield phenomenon explains anything, the forests in North America were probably much more lively than they are now, at some time in the near past. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons to believe the causation is anthropogenic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;North America&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;North America used to have &lt;a href=\"http://www.ozarkbisons.com/aboutbison.php\"&gt;buffalo heards&lt;/a&gt; as far as the eye could see. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon\"&gt;Passenger pigeon&lt;/a&gt; flocks that used to cover the sky. They both don&amp;#39;t exist anymore, the latter not at all, the former not at the level it used to. And this is  entirely because of what I would confidently assert as &lt;a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/05/the-buffalo-killers/482349/\"&gt;unadulterated evil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did North America in the abstract not lose something great? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Europe&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Europe lost 60% of its forest cover because of agriculture and development. Thankfully &lt;a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.ZS?locations=EU\"&gt;its recovering&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gives me an uneasy feeling ,a sort of &amp;quot;are we playing with fire&amp;quot; type of feeling, when we can just wipe out 60% of life in a continent to live ourselves. There&amp;#39;s not much more to it, just a passing thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Concluding thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am well aware that some damage to the enviorment has to be done to progress technologically. We need to mine raw materials to make bridges, cars, and computers. Some of that will ruin some forests and some mountains. I am also well aware that not doing destroying some of nature means terrible living standards forever. I understand all that clear enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I also think sometimes, what good would having tall buildings and planes means if there are no places to live or go with tall trees and bushes with bugs and lizards. Mountains with tall trees and bushes. And land with mountains. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Save the Earth&amp;quot; is a vacuous phrase. The Earth has been there for billions of years without us and can do fine. Yes, we need the Earth to literally live, but we also need it for other things that make life worth living right? What candle does the tallest building hold to Mt Everest if awe is to be inspired? What candle does a botanical garden hold to the Amazon rain-forest?  Is the NYC skyline more awe inspiring than the Niagara falls? Can any zoo in the world replace seeing lions hunt in the Serengeti? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have enough knowledge to assert if its all doom and gloom and the natural world is inevitibly soon to be gone forever. But I do know that we already lost a fair bit of it, and we are losing it fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ihddgmx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1658612017.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_w1s5b7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": "991bceb0-301f-11e9-a749-0ed81f530880", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ihcc72i", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ihcc72i", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "MelodicBerries", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1658595784.0, "send_replies": false, "parent_id": "t3_w1s5b7", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_40utrd39", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Orban says the quiet part out loud:\n\n[Orb\u00e1n: \"Hungarians are not a mixed race and do not want to become one\"](https://dailynewshungary.com/orban-hungarians-are-not-a-mixed-race-and-does-not-want-to-become-one/)\n\n&gt; He slammed Western European countries and politicians for encouraging illegal migration and mixing their population.

So hop on buckoes and buckettes, we're about to take another spin on the merry-go-round.\n\n[Four days ago at a mall in Indiana](https://www.foxnews.com/us/indiana-police-say-good-samaritan-took-out-mall-shooter-15-seconds-landed-8-of-10-shots), 20 year old Jonathan Sapirman opened fire with a rifle, killing three and injuring two more. He was 'neutralized' by bystander-with-a-gun Elisjsha Dicken within 15 seconds. Here's the [front page article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/18/us/greenwood-indiana-mall-shooting.html) the NYT ran:\n\n&gt;By that time, the gunman, identified by the police as Jonathan Douglas Sapirman, 20, had already killed three people and injured two others. But the deadly spree on Sunday was cut short by a 22-year-old bystander carrying a handgun while shopping with his girlfriend.  \n\n&gt;Chief Jim Ison of the Greenwood Police Department called the bystander\u2019s actions \u201cnothing short of heroic,\u201d identifying him as Elisjsha Dicken of Seymour, Ind.\n&gt;\u201cHe engaged the gunman from quite a distance with a handgun, was very proficient in that, very tactically sound, and, as he moved to close in on the suspect, he was also motioning for people to exit behind him,\u201d Chief Ison said at a news conference where he described surveillance video footage of the shooting.\n&gt;\u201cThis young man, Greenwood\u2019s good Samaritan, acted within seconds, stopping the shooter and saving countless lives,\u201d Mayor Mark Myers said on Monday.\n\nThere's no reference in the article to gun control, nothing about the NRA/gun lobby, nothing about the fact that the shooter [posted an image of a nazi officer on 4chan](https://www.thedailybeast.com/greenwood-mall-shooter-jonathan-sapirman-appeared-to-post-chilling-message-on-4chan-with-nazi-imagery?ref=scroll) prior to the shooting. The 'White Nationalist nazi probably-Trump supporting incel shoots 3 hispanic people' story practically writes itself here. There's a short paragraph about the victims that's almost an afterthought:\n\n&gt;The Johnson County coroner identified the victims, who were all from Indianapolis, as Victor Gomez, 30; and a husband and wife, Pedro Pineda, 56, and Rosa Mirian Rivera de Pineda, 37. Two additional people were injured: a 22-year-old woman hospitalized with a leg wound and a 12-year-old girl struck by a bullet fragment.\n\nIt's mostly just glowing praise for the good samaritan who shot the kid. There's no reference to statistics that most mass shootings aren't stopped by bystanders (although they did [run another article later that made that claim)](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/us/armed-bystander-indiana-mall-shooting.html). They also ran another [largely neutral story](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/17/us/greenwood-mall-shooting-indiana.html) along with a video of [police officers praising the bystander](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000008449377/indiana-mall-shooting-suspect.html). \n\nFox News ran a story with this headline: ['Media downplays \u2018good Samaritan\u2019 narrative following Indiana shooting, firearms experts weigh in'](https://www.foxnews.com/media/media-downplays-good-samaritan-narrative-following-indiana-shooting-firearms-experts-weigh-in), because I suppose the NYT coverage was too biased. \n\nThe substance to their accusations of criticism:\n\n&gt;The New York Times also weighed on the debate in a piece written by Richard Fausset, Eliza Fawcett and Serge F. Kovaleski, acknowledging that although Dicken\u2019s actions were \"heroic,\" they were also a \"statistical unicorn.\" Citing an expert on gun policy at UCLA, they wrote most states that require a permit to carry a firearm do not require active shooter response training, and that if good guys with guns was the answer, training would be required across the board. \n\nA point which does not seem to be rebutted in the article. This is the closest I can find to a refutation:\n\n&gt;Cam Edwards, the editor of Second Amendment news site Bearing Arms, claimed that media coverage is simply biased when it comes to concealed carry, and more specifically, the idea that armed citizens \"can and do save lives.\" He also stressed the importance of proper gun training.  \n&gt;\"Every situation is different, of course, but generally speaking if someone has the means and the training to engage an individual who's actively trying to murder as many innocent people as possible I don't see any reason why we wouldn't want them to act as quickly as possible,\" he told Fox News Digital.  \n&gt;Smith too encouraged proper gun training, and said that the idea of a \"good guy with a gun\" argument is definitely \"situation specific.\" Nevertheless, she urged gun owners who heard of the Indiana shooting to get the proper resources, and not to irresponsibly dive into an active shooter situation.   \n\nI suspect I'm going to get the same answers as last time, but...what more do you want from the legacy media? They run this (in my opinion) almost right-slanted story and still get smeared as being ideologically biased. Red tribe still hates the fake news NYT and will never read this anyways, which serves Trump and the Republican party well. (Un)Surprisingly, this incident and the media coverage hasn't been discussed around here, so you aren't rewarding them for it. Why not? Why is it so rare that this space highlights a good deed or a de-escalation as opposed to dancing around the twitter bonfire like [Jack's tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies) and feeding on accelerationism?\n\nMaybe when you read the next hot take trashing this or that outlet (including Fox news!), consider the many stories like this one that fly under the radar.\n\nApologies in advance, but I'll be busy this weekend and likely won't participate much in the comments.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ih8dtll", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I frequently argue in this space that the West, and particularly America, are not as divided as we seem.

This seems to be substantiated [by a chart here](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/oil-prices-and-price-gouging-deconstructing-the-price-of-gas/) that shows the breakdown of profit margins across producers, refiners and gas stations. But doesn\u2019t this leave open the possibility that oil and gas companies are charging inflated prices to intermediaries, while refineries and gas stations are forced to resell at the lowest feasible point to keep business, thus keeping their profit margins tight while the producers grow fat?\n\nFrom the courthouse piece:\n\n&gt;Although the U.S. is the world\u2019s largest oil producer, all U.S. companies together account for only 14.5% of global oil production and thus even if they all somehow worked together they would have a very limited ability to sway global markets. The 13 OPEC countries, by contrast, produce a combined 44% of the world\u2019s oil. Russia accounts for 13.1%, and Canada produces 5.8%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nOf course, factor in that Russia, Iran and Venezuela are out of the picture for US markets and China (normally about equal to Russia at around 15%) is running at reduced capacity.  Maybe all this increases the ability of the American companies to influence price changes, but not by a gigantic amount \u2013 it still wouldn\u2019t come close to OPEC\u2019s market share even minus Iran, and we would still need evidence that American companies were behaving in a cartelized manner.\n\nThe second hand evidence that does exist seems to be, as noted by the President, that current pump prices are above what they historically have been for the current barrel price, as well as the fact that pump prices didn\u2019t fall in response to the March dip in oil prices (though [this piece argues](https://www.courthousenews.com/evidence-of-gasoline-price-gouging-is-very-hard-to-find/) that oil prices generally rise quickly and fall more slowly).  Furthermore, the oil companies\u2019 complaints that they\u2019re operating at max capacity seem a little self serving given that they don\u2019t actually seem to be investing in digging new wells; instead that money is going right to the fat cats on top:\n\n&gt;A more significant allegation is that U.S. oil drillers are taking advantage of the situation by limiting their production to keep prices high. Instead of plowing profits back into drilling, Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell spent more than $44 billion on stock buybacks and dividends in 2021 and have pledged up to $30 billion or more in buybacks this year\n\nWhy is this?\n\n&gt;The real reason that oil companies aren\u2019t madly drilling, the Dallas Fed says, is because shareholders don\u2019t want them to. After years of aggressively expanding operations that produced boom-and-bust cycles \u2014 including enormous losses during the pandemic when oil prices briefly turned negative \u2014 shareholders are demanding that energy companies focus on highly profitable assets rather than speculative new ones. And even though prices have spiked recently, especially after the Ukraine invasion, new drilling is time-consuming, and it\u2019s not clear how long the current cycle will last.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In addition, with trillions of dollars flowing into socially conscious ESG (environmental, social and governance) mutual funds, investors are signaling that they want companies to move away from fossil fuels.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cSo far \u2014 and I am on the front lines, I see this every day \u2014 there is no interest to go in this space,\u201d said Jeffrey Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On the regulatory front, although the Biden administration claims that it\u2019s not holding producers back, environmental and other regulations have made it \u201cnearly impossible to build a new refinery in the United States,\u201d said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Management.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here.  I am not a finance guy but I guess it seems a little hard to believe that there is \u201cno interest to go in this space\u201d during an extended and indefinite period to wrest control of a huge market share and make a ton of money, but maybe the future really is so uncertain that just makes sense.

The short historical sequence goes like this: \n\n1: After the Las Vegas shooting (in which the gunman owned but did not use a weapon with a bump stock), Trump directed the ATF to reclassify bump stocks as \"machine guns\", a legal move which erases the distinction between semi- and full-automatic firearms. No longer is the dividing line \"one shot per pull of the trigger\". Now the official position of the ATF is that a machine gun is any gun that can be fired quickly (undefined). [Jerry's](https://youtu.be/0FbUMqoyjDw?t=48) gonna need a tax stamp!\n\n2: With bump stocks banned, but the legal fight only beginning and nobody turning them in, they turn to pistol braces, another legal-loophole device for a different law. In essence, these allow people who live in states that ban or heavily restrict SBRs (short-barreled rifles) to have a similar gun that is classified legally as a pistol. Sold as a device for disabled people, this is rarely how they are used, it's just a stock by another name, but legally distinct to keep from violating the NFA. \n\n3: So the anti-gun position has been to try to get the pistol braces banned not for being an end-run around the NFA, but for being a machine gun!

The short historical sequence goes like this: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1: After the Las Vegas shooting (in which the gunman owned but did not use a weapon with a bump stock), Trump directed the ATF to reclassify bump stocks as &amp;quot;machine guns&amp;quot;, a legal move which erases the distinction between semi- and full-automatic firearms. No longer is the dividing line &amp;quot;one shot per pull of the trigger&amp;quot;. Now the official position of the ATF is that a machine gun is any gun that can be fired quickly (undefined). &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/0FbUMqoyjDw?t=48\"&gt;Jerry&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; gonna need a tax stamp!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2: With bump stocks banned, but the legal fight only beginning and nobody turning them in, they turn to pistol braces, another legal-loophole device for a different law. In essence, these allow people who live in states that ban or heavily restrict SBRs (short-barreled rifles) to have a similar gun that is classified legally as a pistol. Sold as a device for disabled people, this is rarely how they are used, it&amp;#39;s just a stock by another name, but legally distinct to keep from violating the NFA. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3: So the anti-gun position has been to try to get the pistol braces banned not for being an end-run around the NFA, but for being a machine gun! This, despite the fact that there is zero way for a pistol brace to increase the rate of fire over a regular stock, if anything the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For non-gun-people, it&amp;#39;s a bit like if we banned sports cars for being too fast, then reclassified ten-speed bikes as sports cars, then banned bicycle shorts for being a turbo-charger.

In some ways I\u2019m a native of a culture in which the changes wrought on society by widely available contraception are accepted and taken for granted. The details of how to adjust to such changes are still playing out, but the broad strokes were laid down before I was born. I grew up, not in the absence of a traditional structure around sex, but in the *presence* of a structure that replaces that older one.\n\nThe value system that shaped my childhood sex education was one that wanted me to know about my body and to live in it confidently and without feelings of shame about any part of it. I also understood that society, and my parents, wanted me to avoid sexual coercion and avoid coercing others; avoid having sex too young and avoid getting pregnant before I wanted to. I knew my parents didn\u2019t really approve of casual sex and I also knew they\u2019d be very worried if I were to get married to someone I hadn\u2019t already had sex with.\n\nI don\u2019t think that worldview was perfect; I have criticisms of it from both directions. But I also know that there were places where it succeeded beautifully. There were, indeed, aspects of it that were of incalculable value. The fact that my mother went out of her way not to communicate discomfort when I wanted to know about my body, as a preschooler, really *did* give me a foundational happy confidence. It meant that I could absorb other norms around privacy and courtesy to others as an overlay on that base layer; the shame doesn\u2019t go all the way down. That\u2019s honestly a priceless thing to have.\n\nPuberty classes when we were all eleven years old or so were also really good. It honestly hadn\u2019t occurred to me that people in more conservative parts of the USA might not get these until I casually mentioned them to my husband. I hadn\u2019t quite realised that people would classify them as sex education. Admittedly, there were aspects of them that were related to sex: we learned about erections as well as periods. But most of what we learned was structured around \u201cyour body is about to get weird, don\u2019t freak out\u201d and \u201cyour peers\u2019 bodies are also going to be changing, it is going to be weird for them, be nice.\u201d The latter message is why it was really helpful that they didn\u2019t separate us by gender. \u201cAdolescent boys get erections for all manner of reasons, you don\u2019t have to read too much into it\u201d is a message with two target audiences. (The part where erections are also theoretically relevant to sex was mentioned before *very* swiftly moving on. I absorbed this fact with interest. I do not think I was harmed by it.)\n\nBy contrast, the high school lessons that *were* referred to as \u201csex education\u201d honestly felt a bit embarrassing and useless. Sure, I learned something from seeing a condom demonstrated, even if I, for one, was not going to need that lesson for a good long while. Aside from that, though, I think by then we all knew everything we were being told about the mechanics of sex. I also knew pretty much everything they told us about STDs and contraceptives, either by hearing it from my mother or by reading about it. I\u2019m too old for consent to have been on the syllabus, though I know that is changing in a lot of places, but I can easily imagine it being taught just as uselessly, if the overall atmosphere of detached tension hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nUnlike \u201cpuberty class,\u201d when we learned \u201csex education,\u201d we knew that this was something controversial and politically contested, and it showed in the structure of the lesson. Puberty classes felt *human*. We talked about feelings. Mostly unpleasant feelings of adolescent discomfort, admittedly, but we talked about them. Sex education did not talk about feelings, not really. It made the lessons both less engaging and less useful. Yet I know that everything I might have liked them to include would have political valence of one kind or another.\n\nIf I could go back in time and construct the lesson myself, I would include the way that sex means different things to different people. The way you can control which meanings you give it, to some extent, but you can\u2019t control the meanings given to it by other people \u2014 you can only do your best to take them into account. I\u2019d discuss emotional intimacy. How it\u2019s common (not compulsory, just common) for sex to work better when there is an underlying emotional rapport. How sex can sometimes *induce* emotional rapport. How sex can feel wrong when you don\u2019t have the right kind of understanding of one another; how the exact type of necessary understanding/intimacy can vary from person to person and doesn\u2019t have to follow a specific formula. How it\u2019s good to pull back and re-think when something feels off; how to accept when your partner needs to pull back and re-think.\n\nA lot of these statements apply across worldviews to some extent. Unfortunately, the details are likely to be contested on both sides by a conservative establishment that wants to say that sex *does* have one correct meaning and one correct set of circumstances, and by a liberal establishment that fears setting norms of any kind, and doesn\u2019t necessarily trust the ability of open-ended structural guidance to empower people to understand themselves and others. So we get a sex education that eschews subjectivity on this most personal of topics.\n\nThe easiest way to allow that subjectivity back in is to narrow the audience to a group of people that does have a set of shared values \u2014 hence, for example, the [Our Whole Lives](https://www.uua.org/re/owl) (OWL) curriculum put together by the Unitarian Universalists. Another strategy is private classes for young people whose parents are ideologically aligned with the teacher. And, of course, there are books and websites which are free to write whatever they like. [Scarleteen](https://www.scarleteen.com) was quite well known in my circles, as a young adult.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that small, private classes have come in for some of the worst criticism from the likes of Chris Rufo. Compared to a centralised curriculum like OWL, there is going to be greater underlying variance giving rise to more outliers. Compared to a book or a website, there is going to be greater ambiguity in the available materials, allowing more room for fearmongering.\n\nRufo\u2019s exploitation of ambiguity is particularly effective because the clarifications that it forces from people are still controversial. A large proportion of his audience is unlikely to be pacified by assurances that liberal sexual norms are being adhered to. Not only do they disagree with those norms, they may not even have a clear sense of what such norms would consist of in the first place. Caught on the back foot, his targets can end up protesting about what they *don\u2019t* do (e.g. touching children\u2019s genitals) instead of explaining the positive good they are aiming for (e.g. reducing shame by not making a fuss if children want to touch their own genitals).\n\nI think it\u2019s a real shame when the positive case for liberal sexual norms gets lost in the outrage. An education based on those norms can provide comfort in your own skin, confidence in your understanding of your body, and consideration towards others. Adults promote liberal values because they care about the children and young people who will be guided by them.\n\nThere was really only ever one sex education experience that I had that was uncomfortable in a disturbing sort of way, rather than in an awkward sort of way. We had I separate curriculum, again when we were eleven or twelve or so, about sexual abuse. It mostly consisted of a series of stories; the last one was fairly intense. Not that it was overly explicit, but it managed to be remarkably clear about the social dynamics. I remember the ending: how the child\u2019s mother was angry with her for going along with it, how the child protested that she hadn\u2019t known any better and had been polite as she was taught, how the mother apologised and agreed that it wasn\u2019t the child\u2019s fault. I remember that the story as a whole gave me a small inkling into how abuse could happen. I remember thinking it was hard to hear, but understanding why it might be important.\n\nThat\u2019s the one truly disturbing thing that they taught us, and I get why adults would want a lot of care to be taken with those sorts of lessons. But you know what it wasn\u2019t? It wasn\u2019t grooming.

It's the only article on the topic I found that's not paywalled, and I haven't the motivation to actually read [the 50-page report](https://www.bka.de/DE/AktuelleInformationen/StatistikenLagebilder/Lagebilder/KriminalitaetImKontextVonZuwanderung/KriminalitaetImKontextVonZuwanderung_node.html). I'm going to assume that they don't outright misread the data, though there's probably much in the report that doesn't fit their narrative.\n\nThe German Federal Criminal Police Office recently published their 2021 Federal Crime Report In The Context Of Migration. Here are some CW-relevant numbers.\n\nFor violent and sexual crime, there were 40593 German victims of migrant perpetrators, and 11107 crimes with migrant victims and at least one German perpetrator. According to JF, this means that in violent crime between Germans and migrants, migrants were to blame for 78.5% all cases and Germans for 21.5%. Rape sees migrants as rapists in 95.4% of all cases. For murder, it's 85.7% versus 14.3%.\n\nJF notes that for this report, anyone with a German passport was considered German, and that this includes three quarters of the famous arab crime families in Germany. Presumably this is meant to get the reader to imagine that the numbers might be even more outrageously in disfavor of migrants, but doesn't that work both ways? Wouldn't this also wrongly consider foreigners with German passports German victims of foreigner-on-German violence when it is in fact foreigner-on-foreigner?\n\nAt this point I'm left wondering what this report is even good for. I briefly skimmed it and it seems that it purely concerns itself with \"migrants\" in the sense of asylum seekers, official refugees, registered illegal immigrants and the like. Ever since the German cathedral adopted \"migrant\" as a term describing, in effect, \"anyone who can and does excuse himself as not-German in any way\", the term has been seen as somewhat broader than how this report applies it.\n\nI don't really have a point here. It seems this particular newspaper was eager to construe this report as somewhat equivalent to the famous FBI crime statistics, but it seems to me to fall flat because the situation in Germany lacks any clear black/white distinction.\n\nSorry for the ramble. It seemed relevant, but I fail to make much of it.\n\nI seems obvious to me at ground level that foreigners are very much more likely to be violent than Germans, and that no matter how much you muddy up the distinction this core truth is evident on observation, but I doubt we'll ever see useful statistics verifying or contradicting this.", "edited": 1658478991.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ih5toir", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Germany notices its &amp;quot;13/52&amp;quot; situation, but it&amp;#39;s far less clear than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I&amp;#39;m getting all my numbers and data interpretation on this one from an article by Junge Freiheit, a notoriously partisan and poorly-regarded right-wing newspaper.

According to JF, this means that in violent crime between Germans and migrants, migrants were to blame for 78.5% all cases and Germans for 21.5%. Rape sees migrants as rapists in 95.4% of all cases. For murder, it&amp;#39;s 85.7% versus 14.3%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;JF notes that for this report, anyone with a German passport was considered German, and that this includes three quarters of the famous arab crime families in Germany. Presumably this is meant to get the reader to imagine that the numbers might be even more outrageously in disfavor of migrants, but doesn&amp;#39;t that work both ways? Wouldn&amp;#39;t this also wrongly consider foreigners with German passports German victims of foreigner-on-German violence when it is in fact foreigner-on-foreigner?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;#39;m left wondering what this report is even good for. I briefly skimmed it and it seems that it purely concerns itself with &amp;quot;migrants&amp;quot; in the sense of asylum seekers, official refugees, registered illegal immigrants and the like. Ever since the German cathedral adopted &amp;quot;migrant&amp;quot; as a term describing, in effect, &amp;quot;anyone who can and does excuse himself as not-German in any way&amp;quot;, the term has been seen as somewhat broader than how this report applies it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really have a point here. It seems this particular newspaper was eager to construe this report as somewhat equivalent to the famous FBI crime statistics, but it seems to me to fall flat because the situation in Germany lacks any clear black/white distinction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the ramble. It seemed relevant, but I fail to make much of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seems obvious to me at ground level that foreigners are very much more likely to be violent than Germans, and that no matter how much you muddy up the distinction this core truth is evident on observation, but I doubt we&amp;#39;ll ever see useful statistics verifying or contradicting this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih5toir/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1658475185.0, "author_flair_text": "\"Mejor los indios.\"", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_w1s5b7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ih5eokf", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ih5eokf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "AlternativeEvent2584", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1658465096.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_w1s5b7", "score": 32, "author_fullname": "t2_pjry0rax", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I want to post something I have thinking about for a while.

And slight background on myself: I have a CS degree from a top 50 school but at this point in my career I'm just a glorified sys admin. I'd probably bomb a FAANG interview but I feel like I could get that job if I did leet code for a few months.\n\nNow to my theory. People in my life that are non-technical always ask me how I know so much stuff. To them I'm an expert in everything, especially at my work. I have my hands in pretty much everything at work that's important in IT so I interact with these people all the time. Plus I'm not rude to non-technical people like most STEM lords are so people always go to me because I'm not going to be rude to them for not knowing something.\n\nI'm not a brilliant person and nothing I do is impressive. BUT my one skill that I have is that I'll just go learn something if I don't know it. If for example security buys a new messaging gateway, I'll just look through their documentation and learn all the ways we can automate stuff. When we buy new software, I'll just go look at their documentation and play around with it until I get what I want. I recently had to learn C# for a new product we bought, and mostly what I did was just play around wit their API and ask people on SO if I ran into any issues. I was just as confused as they were, but I actually just followed through and just messed with it until I got it working.\n\nTo contrast this, my mom has a PhD and is briliant but she just gives up on anything technical after 5 minutes. I contrast this with a woman I work with who is a high level engineer. In the 90's she got annoyed that she couldn't get certain data as an accountant and taught herself programming just to solve issues then became a software engineer and is now a millionaire and a director of software engineering at our company. She just was persistent in learning things until she got what she wanted. \n\nEssentially, the \"skill\" is how long you'll persist if the issue is difficult. It's why people drop out of engineering programs because they have trouble with integrals. Another example I'll give is a woman I worked with who was having issue with SharePoint. She opened a ticket with us and insisted she be on any emails with Microsoft. She ended up becoming an expert in SharePoint for our company and got the certs and now doubled her salary working as a SharePoint admin for a credit card company. She used me as a reference.\n\nSo my point is that intelligence isn't necessarily that important for an IT or programming career. What you need is to be comfortable being uncomfortable not knowing things and just learning it. Looking at documentation and just playing around with it until you know it. That's the only reason people at my work think I'm smart is because I'll just play around with stuff until I get it. I'll just make an appointment to meet the team that we are able to learn from with their company. That's it. I'm not some super smart guy. I just have the persistence and ability to not know something and not be embarrassed for not knowing it.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this and used it for their career? People think I'm really smart and it's not the case. I just go out of my way to learn things. Maybe it's because I have a CS degree so I learned how to learn, but it feels like most people's problems with tech is that they just give up quickly. Everything is online if you want to learn it. And how to we instill this in people? It seems to just be a personality trait.

This bill basically sets out a list of reasons why abortions may not be restricted and creates a test for what future reasons will be prohibited by the law. It targets pretty directly laws various Republican states passed when *Roe* was still in effect to limit abortion. It empowers both the US Attorney General and private parties (including those seeking abortions and those providing them) to sue to enforce the law.\n\nThe second of these is the [Ensuring Women\u2019s Right to Reproductive Freedom Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8297/text?r=1&amp;s=1). This law creates liability (enforced by either the Attorney General or private citizens) for anyone acting under color of State law who tries to prevent someone from traveling interstate for the purpose of getting an abortion that would be legal in the state they are going to have it done in.\n\nBoth bills passed the House with all but one Democrat in favor and all Republicans against.\n\nBoth bills are most likely dead on arrival in the Senate.\n\n---\n\nOn Tuesday the House of Representatives also passed the [Respect For Marriage Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8404/text) which enshrines, not [*Obergefell v. Hodges*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) but rather [*United States v. Windsor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor) into federal law. The law does not require that states perform either same sex or interracial marriages but it does require they recognize those marriages if performed in other states where they are legal. It is also enforceable by either the Attorney General or a private right of action. The law also clarifies that the federal definition of marriage includes both interracial and same sex marriages.\n\nInterestingly 47 Republicans (~one-fourth of the caucus) joined the Democrats in passing the bill. If a similar fraction of Senate Republicans support the bill that would be sufficient to invoke cloture and pass it.\n\n---\n\nFinally, introduced today by a bipartisan group of Senators (but not passed anywhere) is the [Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/electoral_count_reform_and_presidential_transition_improvement_act_of_2022.pdf). Exploitation of some ambiguity in the 12th amendment and Electoral Count Act (USC 3) were key to John Eastman's plan for Trump to retain the presidency even after losing the 2020 election. This act is an attempt to remove that ambiguity. The Act does so first by clarifying that state electors are determined by the laws of the state *prior to election day*. This is to prevent state legislatures from changing who the electors are after the vote has happened (unless they delegated themselves that power in advance). The Act also raises the threshold necessary to trigger a vote on an objection from one Senator and one Representative to one-fifth of Senators and Representatives. It also clarifies the grounds on which electors may be objected to. Finally it clarifies that the role of the President of the Senate is ministerial only and sets up an expedited legal process (three judge panel, then SCOTUS) for hearing challenges to election certification.", "edited": 1658351494.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_igyr7zl", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about a post on some recent Congressional legislation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The House of Representatives has now passed two bills aimed at protecting abortion rights. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first is the &lt;a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3755/text\"&gt;Women&amp;#39;s Health Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;.

The law also clarifies that the federal definition of marriage includes both interracial and same sex marriages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly 47 Republicans (~one-fourth of the caucus) joined the Democrats in passing the bill. If a similar fraction of Senate Republicans support the bill that would be sufficient to invoke cloture and pass it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, introduced today by a bipartisan group of Senators (but not passed anywhere) is the &lt;a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/electoral_count_reform_and_presidential_transition_improvement_act_of_2022.pdf\"&gt;Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Exploitation of some ambiguity in the 12th amendment and Electoral Count Act (USC 3) were key to John Eastman&amp;#39;s plan for Trump to retain the presidency even after losing the 2020 election. This act is an attempt to remove that ambiguity. The Act does so first by clarifying that state electors are determined by the laws of the state &lt;em&gt;prior to election day&lt;/em&gt;. This is to prevent state legislatures from changing who the electors are after the vote has happened (unless they delegated themselves that power in advance). The Act also raises the threshold necessary to trigger a vote on an objection from one Senator and one Representative to one-fifth of Senators and Representatives. It also clarifies the grounds on which electors may be objected to. Finally it clarifies that the role of the President of the Senate is ministerial only and sets up an expedited legal process (three judge panel, then SCOTUS) for hearing challenges to election certification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igyr7zl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1658350215.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_w1s5b7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 25}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": "991bceb0-301f-11e9-a749-0ed81f530880", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_igy93di", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "igy93di", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "DinoInNameOnly", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1658342658.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_w1s5b7", "score": 38, "author_fullname": "t2_13ryno", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Merriam-Webster recently updated the definition of the word \"female\": The first one:\n\n&gt;of, relating to, or being the sex that typically has the capacity to bear young or produce eggs\n\nThe second one is different:\n\n&gt;having a gender identity that is the opposite of male\n\nThe definitions for male are similar.

And will continue to do so. \n\n\nRecently there was a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/ifl02lf/) talking about how; now that covid restrictions are mostly done with; covid is not something most people really think or talk about. But, there are still two groups of people who continue to talk about covid. Those who were really scared and still are, and the \"skeptics\". The post somewhat implied that both groups are extremist in some way or the other on the issue of covid. \n\nI will try to defend my case on why I think my position of being a skeptic should have been the default position. And the fact it wasn't requires some heavy investigation as to why.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nAs a \"covid skeptic\" much of the discourse around covid restrictions makes me feel like I am being 'gaslighted' on a grand level. The jist of it being that I operated under one overton window, one epistemology my entire life and both those things get radically shifted and transformed in 2 years and everyone is suddenly on board, and I am the crazy one for asking \"wait what about everything we knew before?\"? \n\nTo put it shortly there have been shifts on multiple overton windows in ways that are not conductive to a epistemologycally and politically healthy society and somebody has to acknowledge and speak about it. And continue speaking about it, because some of these shifts pave the way for tremendous injustices. \n\nHere are the reasons why I will keep talking about covid for the rest of my life. And I will not be convinced I am crazy or of a certain ideological group because I do so. I believe the ones who are not talking about these things have had the cloak successfully put over their eyes (even if they are otherwise skeptics), they forgave what was done to them after it wasn't being done anymore, they are complacent.\n\n1. Being a \"covid skeptic\" is the default position of almost all societies before 2020. It was the medical consensus that;\n * Lockdowns are not worth it (QALY,$, \"human rights\" ) for the vast majority of diseases. The ones that pose an IFR high enough to justify them are not that scary because they also tend to be non contagious for various reasons. \nWhat was  essentially considered putting entire cities or countries of people under house arrest suddenly became the default mode of addressing the problem? \n * Universal masking is ineffective for airborne diseases.\n * Vaccinating the entire population by threatening the loss of education/work is by the State is overstepping the bounds by any reasonable western State. \n\n The first two points are correct. They were reached after decades of \"good science\". The bullshit ideological science (along with all sorts of publication bias and a thousand other traps) peddled to make it seem that lockdowns are worth it and masks work are the work of pure propaganda. We can't just let that slide right? If \"mistakes\" were made, they need to be discussed and analyzed lest they not be repeated. \n\n We can't just replace the field of public health which is fundamentally based on the idea of a cost benefit analysis with some idiotic throw EVERYTHING at the wall and hope it works at whatever costs method right? More importantly we can't have this \"philosophy\" wear the skin-suit of what it replaced and pretend to be something it is not, rational. Least of all this needs to be discussed. \n\n2.  The much obvious economic malign caused by covid policies are blamed on \"supply chain issues\",\"Ukraine war\", \"general economic turmoil\", etc. Why is no one talking about the elephant in the room when it comes to economic downturn?\n\n\tReally? Lockdowns and travel bans and printing all that money had nothing to do with the inflation and economic struggles? Why is no one discussing the policies that literally consisted of shutting down economies not having an effect when economies are shutting down? Would Sri Lanka be where it is today if not for travel bans and lockdowns? \n\n\tIn a recent [video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxdHm2dmvKE) by Jordan Peterson. He posits that perhaps the Russian invasion of Ukraine was in part caused by covid restrictions, as some far out there nth order effect. That world leaders being isolated from each other in person for nearing two years might have been a straw that broke the camels back. Even if this sounds like a far reaching judgement on the surface, is it not more far reaching to assert that two years of lockdowns, mandates, minimized travel, and all its social and economic malaise would not manifest at the margins?\n\n      What about an easier to digest example? The mass shootings in the US? They must be at least slightly correlated with the declining social and economic environment right? Why is no one talking about how further isolating and economically straining those on the margins of shooting up a school going to make them do it? Hell I wanted to cause mayhem as I was locked up in my room (don't live in the US) for 2 months on end. \n\n3. The overton window has been shifted significantly towards authoritarianism. We expected the government to play God and deal with nature in 2020 and they let us have our cake, they gladly played as the Gods people wanted them to play so desperately.

And will continue to do so.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently there was a &lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/ifl02lf/\"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; talking about how; now that covid restrictions are mostly done with; covid is not something most people really think or talk about. But, there are still two groups of people who continue to talk about covid. Those who were really scared and still are, and the &amp;quot;skeptics&amp;quot;. The post somewhat implied that both groups are extremist in some way or the other on the issue of covid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will try to defend my case on why I think my position of being a skeptic should have been the default position. And the fact it wasn&amp;#39;t requires some heavy investigation as to why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a &amp;quot;covid skeptic&amp;quot; much of the discourse around covid restrictions makes me feel like I am being &amp;#39;gaslighted&amp;#39; on a grand level. The jist of it being that I operated under one overton window, one epistemology my entire life and both those things get radically shifted and transformed in 2 years and everyone is suddenly on board, and I am the crazy one for asking &amp;quot;wait what about everything we knew before?&amp;quot;? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To put it shortly there have been shifts on multiple overton windows in ways that are not conductive to a epistemologycally and politically healthy society and somebody has to acknowledge and speak about it. And continue speaking about it, because some of these shifts pave the way for tremendous injustices. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are the reasons why I will keep talking about covid for the rest of my life. And I will not be convinced I am crazy or of a certain ideological group because I do so. I believe the ones who are not talking about these things have had the cloak successfully put over their eyes (even if they are otherwise skeptics), they forgave what was done to them after it wasn&amp;#39;t being done anymore, they are complacent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a &amp;quot;covid skeptic&amp;quot; is the default position of almost all societies before 2020. It was the medical consensus that;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lockdowns are not worth it (QALY,$, &amp;quot;human rights&amp;quot; ) for the vast majority of diseases. The ones that pose an IFR high enough to justify them are not that scary because they also tend to be non contagious for various reasons. \nWhat was  essentially considered putting entire cities or countries of people under house arrest suddenly became the default mode of addressing the problem? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Universal masking is ineffective for airborne diseases.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vaccinating the entire population by threatening the loss of education/work is by the State is overstepping the bounds by any reasonable western State. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first two points are correct. They were reached after decades of &amp;quot;good science&amp;quot;. The bullshit ideological science (along with all sorts of publication bias and a thousand other traps) peddled to make it seem that lockdowns are worth it and masks work are the work of pure propaganda. We can&amp;#39;t just let that slide right? If &amp;quot;mistakes&amp;quot; were made, they need to be discussed and analyzed lest they not be repeated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t just replace the field of public health which is fundamentally based on the idea of a cost benefit analysis with some idiotic throw EVERYTHING at the wall and hope it works at whatever costs method right? More importantly we can&amp;#39;t have this &amp;quot;philosophy&amp;quot; wear the skin-suit of what it replaced and pretend to be something it is not, rational. Least of all this needs to be discussed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The much obvious economic malign caused by covid policies are blamed on &amp;quot;supply chain issues&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Ukraine war&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;general economic turmoil&amp;quot;, etc. Why is no one talking about the elephant in the room when it comes to economic downturn?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really? Lockdowns and travel bans and printing all that money had nothing to do with the inflation and economic struggles? Why is no one discussing the policies that literally consisted of shutting down economies not having an effect when economies are shutting down? Would Sri Lanka be where it is today if not for travel bans and lockdowns? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxdHm2dmvKE\"&gt;video essay&lt;/a&gt; by Jordan Peterson. He posits that perhaps the Russian invasion of Ukraine was in part caused by covid restrictions, as some far out there nth order effect. That world leaders being isolated from each other in person for nearing two years might have been a straw that broke the camels back. Even if this sounds like a far reaching judgement on the surface, is it not more far reaching to assert that two years of lockdowns, mandates, minimized travel, and all its social and economic malaise would not manifest at the margins?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about an easier to digest example? The mass shootings in the US? They must be at least slightly correlated with the declining social and economic environment right? Why is no one talking about how further isolating and economically straining those on the margins of shooting up a school going to make them do it? Hell I wanted to cause mayhem as I was locked up in my room (don&amp;#39;t live in the US) for 2 months on end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overton window has been shifted significantly towards authoritarianism. We expected the government to play God and deal with nature in 2020 and they let us have our cake, they gladly played as the Gods people wanted them to play so desperately. As a libertarian I don&amp;#39;t think this is a good development.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did we really expect the governments to do everything they did in 2020 for diseases of the past. They were given the right to put people under house arrest for arbitrary levels of disease depending on time and place. This is a terrible precedent. Will this increased state power never be used for stamping out dissent in the future? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To further add on.
