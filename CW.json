['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 29, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_x0hc17", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 32, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1661753708.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

That **is the break-even point**. Each aditional dollar I borrow means $1.08 that disappears at the end.\n\n$93,000 is a lot of debt. [Only 4% get over 56K](https://www.aplu.org/our-work/5-archived-projects/college-costs-tuition-and-financial-aid/publicuvalues/student-debt.html) and only 0.5% hit 100K. Average medical debt is $200,000 but my numbers were based on a salary of $100,000 which doctors will eclipse.\n\nWhat if I run a family of 4? At $100,000 my DI is $58,375. That drops all the above loan numbers by about 30%. **$68,000 is still a lot of loans** to take out.\n\nBut let us change the salary. Average salary for a college graduate is around $55,000. For the single guy, that is a DI of $35,000, meaning annual payments of $3500. This is a DI of 44% of the original value, meaning **the break-even is now $40,700**. About 20% of graduates hit this level, eyeballing the earlier aplu.org link. This is starting to become a serious moral hazard.\n\nFor a family of 4 the DI at $55,000 is only $13375. That **requires only $15,600 in debt**. I am not so much worried about financially supporting a family of 4 making $55,000 as I am in giving them a direct incentive to go as expensive as possible once loans hit $15,600.\n\n\n\n**Proposed Regime**\n\nThe [new program](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2022/08/26/the-new-income-driven-repayment-system-could-cause-some-big-problems/) has these relevant changes:\n\n* Increase the amount of income not subject to IDR from 150 percent of the federal poverty line to 225 percent of the federal poverty line.\n\n* Eliminate any accrual of interest on IDR-enrolled loans.\n\n* For undergraduate debt, reduce the IDR rate from 10 percent of income beyond the threshold in (1) to 5 percent of income beyond the threshold in (1).\n\nItems 1 and 3 directly change my math. I will get back to item 2 later.\n\nSo now our fresh-college-graduate-single-guy-making-$100,000 has a DI of (100000 - 13590 * 2.2) or $70,000 and annual payments of $3500. This means **the break-even point is now $40,700.** If he has (or will soon have) a family of 4 his DI is now just $38,950 and will pay no more than $1,950 per year. **Just $22,600 in loans is the break-even**, meaning there is no difference to him between borrowing $22,600 and $93,000. Might as well go into luxury student housing, move the family in.\n\nThat average college grad making $55,000 with a family of 4? Your DI is *less than zero*. In fact, **any income up to $61,050 means you do not have to pay a single cent towards your loans**, as the balance stays flat and the 20-year timer ticks away.\n\nItem 2 is missing from my analysis. If I read it right, as long as your income is below the IBR threshold, no money gets added, but in a lot of my above analysis that did not matter because uncapitalized interest vanished.\n\nI guess it matters if you think you will have many years of salad days and then suddenly earn a lot of money. If you could get an extra dollar in financial aid and put it in a crummy retail bank savings account, that would still be a good idea. Either 20 years hits and you get to keep all the money, or your income goes up and you withdraw the money from the savings account to pay it back.\n\nI want to make up a web calculator that shows the break-even point for given circumstances, but first I need to figure out how many mistakes I made above.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_imu8nvt", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Income Based Repayment is totally insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People had pointed out that it was a reasonable part of the loan forgiveness.

I mean this guy literally said an election was corrupted solely because he lost. his supporters have also demonstrated a willingness to back Trump&amp;#39;s interest with violence. based on their stances, what underlying principles can possibly be said to undergird trump or his supporters&amp;#39; stances? at a certain point we have to b able to recognize something for what it is. and I&amp;#39;ve also heard that republicans are starting to distance themselves from trump after the revelations of the past month, so the timing of this could end up being fairly astute on biden&amp;#39;s part.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imtooq6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1662140796.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_x0hc17", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 1, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": -3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_imtiik9", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "imtiik9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "wear146", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1662138387.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_x0hc17", "score": 72, "author_fullname": "t2_chpiy", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "This isn\u2019t necessarily culture war but I wanted to share what I consider to be some unambiguously good news which defied all of my expectations, namely that California will be saving the Diablo Canyon Nuclear power plant (https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-01/lawmakers-approve-1-4-billion-loan-for-pg-e-to-keep-diablo-canyon-nuclear-plant-open?_amp=true ).

I personally don't have a problem with the idea of people being transgender. My biggest problem with it is I think we don't have the technology to actually do what is being promised and the surgery/transitioning is cruel to vulnerable people. All you have to do is go on /b or /pol to see the results to see that this is not a settled scientific process. I know it sounds gross, but seeing the results of these surgeries just makes me sick to my stomach. And then you have the child side where kids who aren't even fully developed emotionally/physically getting life changing surgery that can't be reversed. This is what bothers me the most.\n\nI truly think we will look back on this time the same as we do with lobotomies. It feels like we are doing experimental surgery on vulnerable people who would be better off staying their assigned gender. That's my argument against this current (what I consider) madness.\n\nI feel that most people agree with me here. However, if transitioning was actually possible, would you change your mind? To me, it makes the debate over. If you can safely and effectively transition people, what is the downside?\n\nEdit: On the 4chan part, I was being glib there. The point I was trying to make is that we only see bad results. With how aggressive the trans lobby is, if they were actually the same in how they looked, people would be saying look it's indistinguishable. That fact that we don't see this shows they know it looks unnatural and would be off-putting to most people if they actually saw the results. I\u2019ve never seen a trans person pass irl.

I personally don&amp;#39;t have a problem with the idea of people being transgender. My biggest problem with it is I think we don&amp;#39;t have the technology to actually do what is being promised and the surgery/transitioning is cruel to vulnerable people. All you have to do is go on /b or /pol to see the results to see that this is not a settled scientific process. I know it sounds gross, but seeing the results of these surgeries just makes me sick to my stomach. And then you have the child side where kids who aren&amp;#39;t even fully developed emotionally/physically getting life changing surgery that can&amp;#39;t be reversed. This is what bothers me the most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I truly think we will look back on this time the same as we do with lobotomies. It feels like we are doing experimental surgery on vulnerable people who would be better off staying their assigned gender. That&amp;#39;s my argument against this current (what I consider) madness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel that most people agree with me here. However, if transitioning was actually possible, would you change your mind? To me, it makes the debate over. If you can safely and effectively transition people, what is the downside?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: On the 4chan part, I was being glib there. The point I was trying to make is that we only see bad results. With how aggressive the trans lobby is, if they were actually the same in how they looked, people would be saying look it&amp;#39;s indistinguishable. That fact that we don&amp;#39;t see this shows they know it looks unnatural and would be off-putting to most people if they actually saw the results. I\u2019ve never seen a trans person pass irl.

We haven't been \\*quite\\* as dependent on Russian power than many other countries - Russian gas was only 5 % of the energy supply, Russians cut the flow already back in May, and in general Russian electricity imports have formed 10 % of the Finnish electricity use. However, prices are still expected to rise very high in the winter, naturally the season when the society most needs electricity and has to import it.\n\nThe crisis is particularly - as everywhere else - hitting those living in detached housing. Even though district heating and, lately, geothermal are increasingly popular for heating, and an increasing amoung of air-source heat pumps have been installed there's still a lot of them relying on direct electric heating, which on current terms translates to \"pay up the nose\". Such houses might well see electricity bills hitting well over a thousand a month, unless nothing is done.\n\nAmong various issues:\n\n\\- Nordic electricity generation is reliant on water power, and though the Nordic countries haven't seen droughts on the Central European level, these are still affecting water power generation. Finland has imported electricity from Norway, and now the Norwegians are mulling restricting [electricity exports](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/22095-lintilae-norway-restricting-electricity-exports-would-play-into-putin-s-hands.html).\n\n\\- There would still be a chance to avoid the worst of it - if the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear generator goes fully online before the schedule, or at least is not delayed any more. Olkiluoto 3 has been the white whale of nuclear projects for years now, incredibly delayed and costly project that is now in test use, with those tests also frequently facing unplanned downtimes. The current estimate for Olkiluoto 3 finally starting commercial use is December 2022, but we'll see. In particular having OL3 being online and without issues would lead to stability - less need to worry about whether winter's particularly cold and how windy/sunny it is for renewables.\n\n\\- While browsing Twitter, I've seen a fair amount of what can only be described as 'schadenfreude' by pro-Russian right-wingers in various countries mocking Europeans with high energy bills and Ukraine flags in the profile photo. There's next to none of that here, as the entire Finnish society continues to be broadly pro-Ukrainian.

We haven&amp;#39;t been *quite* as dependent on Russian power than many other countries - Russian gas was only 5 % of the energy supply, Russians cut the flow already back in May, and in general Russian electricity imports have formed 10 % of the Finnish electricity use. However, prices are still expected to rise very high in the winter, naturally the season when the society most needs electricity and has to import it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crisis is particularly - as everywhere else - hitting those living in detached housing. Even though district heating and, lately, geothermal are increasingly popular for heating, and an increasing amoung of air-source heat pumps have been installed there&amp;#39;s still a lot of them relying on direct electric heating, which on current terms translates to &amp;quot;pay up the nose&amp;quot;. Such houses might well see electricity bills hitting well over a thousand a month, unless nothing is done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among various issues:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Nordic electricity generation is reliant on water power, and though the Nordic countries haven&amp;#39;t seen droughts on the Central European level, these are still affecting water power generation. Finland has imported electricity from Norway, and now the Norwegians are mulling restricting &lt;a href=\"https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/22095-lintilae-norway-restricting-electricity-exports-would-play-into-putin-s-hands.html\"&gt;electricity exports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- There would still be a chance to avoid the worst of it - if the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear generator goes fully online before the schedule, or at least is not delayed any more. Olkiluoto 3 has been the white whale of nuclear projects for years now, incredibly delayed and costly project that is now in test use, with those tests also frequently facing unplanned downtimes. The current estimate for Olkiluoto 3 finally starting commercial use is December 2022, but we&amp;#39;ll see. In particular having OL3 being online and without issues would lead to stability - less need to worry about whether winter&amp;#39;s particularly cold and how windy/sunny it is for renewables.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- While browsing Twitter, I&amp;#39;ve seen a fair amount of what can only be described as &amp;#39;schadenfreude&amp;#39; by pro-Russian right-wingers in various countries mocking Europeans with high energy bills and Ukraine flags in the profile photo. There&amp;#39;s next to none of that here, as the entire Finnish society continues to be broadly pro-Ukrainian. I haven&amp;#39;t seen any major political actors suggesting trying to make nice with Russia as a solution, of course it would be hard to do that by our lonesome anyway as long as we&amp;#39;re a part of the EU, and Russians might tell us to pound sand anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- The environmental aspect is, of course, a big local culture war, especially in a country where much (most?) of the culture war has been environmentalism-related for a long time.

But in effect, it looks like they're taking out their frustrations on random nobodies. One of those guys was Hervis Rogers, who went viral during the 2020 election for waiting in line at a polling place for six hours and being the last person to vote. He eagerly spoke to and gave his name to a TV news crew that was on site, presumably proud to showcase to the public how committed he was to voting.\n\nBut, it turns out, [Rogers was a convicted felon](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/politics/2021/07/14/the-arrest-of-hervis-rogers-brings-bail-reform-into-focus). Now 62 years old, he had been convicted of a burglary almost 3 decades prior, spent 9 years in prison, and was eventually released in 2004. But he remained on parole until June 2020, and Texas law makes it a felony for anyone to \"knowingly\" vote while still serving a parole sentence. The publicity of being broadcast as the face of the voting franchise is likely what prompted an investigation into his voting record. Although his voting rights were restored in time for the 2020 election, Rogers had somehow cast ballots on two separate occasions (in March 2020 and November 2018) while he was still on parole.\n\nTexas' Attorney General, Ken Paxton, [brought the hammer down on Rogers](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/11/texas-voter-arrested-parole/). Paxton had been one of the most enthusiastic boosters of Trump's stolen election theories, and he was responsible for filing the doomed [SCOTUS case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._Pennsylvania) in this realm. Paxton [publicized Rogers' case](https://twitter.com/kenpaxtontx/status/1413642254598688774?lang=en) as a way to flex how seriously he takes allegations of election fraud (Note: Paxton has [ongoing criminal legal issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Paxton#Legal_issues). He was indicted for securities fraud in 2015, and in 2020 several of his deputies had resigned in protest and accused him of bribery and corruption. It's likely that Paxton's enthusiasm in this area was leveraged for the purpose of seeking a presidential pardon). Rogers was arrested and held in jail on $100,000 bail. \n\nPretrial bail is [nominally intended to encourage good behavior](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/the-poverty-trap-of-monetary-bail) from the accused while they wait for their trial. And with that in mind, it's impossible for me to appreciate how someone accused of illegally voting is somehow such a dramatic danger to the community to warrant $100k bail (especially since by the time he was arrested, Rogers' voting rights had been restored for more than a year). Sky-high bail in this case appears to have been used as a way to impose punishment *now*, regardless of the presumption of innocence, and regardless of what ends up happening to his charges down the road.\n\nBecause the facts of Rogers' situation meant that pretrial detention was very likely the only thing they ever would've gotten out of his case. It's difficult to see how the prosecution could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Rogers \"knew\" he was legally barred from voting. After all, he was able to cast ballots on two separate occasions with no issues, and he showed no hesitation about speaking to a camera crew.\n\nThe same thing is again playing out, but this time in Florida. Gov. Ron DeSantis has similarly jumped on the \"tough-on-fraud\" bandwagon and has endorsed several proposals, including advocating for a ballot signature match system [which likely would have disqualified his own voter registration](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2021/04/13/desantis-wants-voters-signatures-to-match-would-his-pass-the-test/). DeSantis recently held a press conference to announce that 20 people with felony convictions who voted in the 2020 election will be arrested and charged. This was showcased as the \"opening salvo\" for the newly minted \"Office of Election Crimes and Security\" that was created by DeSantis.\n\nBefore 2018, Florida had permanent felony disenfranchisement laws (one of only four states). The only way for a felon to regain their voting rights then was to petition the State Board of Executive Clemency. Gov. Charlie Crist had instituted a system of automatic restoration and approved 155,000 applications during his tenure. Gov. Rick Scott ended this system, and the number of approved applications plummeted to 3,000. Florida voters ended up overwhelmingly approving [Amendment 4 in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Florida_Amendment_4), which instituted automatic voting right restoration for felons \"after they complete all terms of their sentence\". That specific clause became the subject of intense litigation, and the Legislature codified that \"all terms\" included paying all outstanding fines.\n\nA persistent problem with this implementation is that nobody seems to have a good idea of when exactly \"complete all terms\" actually happens. State officials have [repeatedly admitted in court they have no good centralized system in place to make this determination](https://www.wlrn.org/news/2019-10-04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-floridas-amendment-4-lawsuit). Court records (many of which several decades old) are all over the place and poorly catalogued, with each local clerk's office using a different format. Sometimes fines are collected by multiple different government agencies, and there is no easy system in place to double-check the ledgers.\n\nThe 20 people whose arrests DeSantis touted so far appear to have been in the same situation: They were *[specifically told by election authorities that they could vote](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/26/desantis-voter-fraud-defendants-florida-00053788)*.\n\nGiven how messy Amendment 4's implementation has been, it's unclear how any normal person is expected to navigate to an answer on their own. Getting an assurance from the local election authority seems to be the best that anyone can expect. So if anyone should get into trouble, perhaps it's the local officials who messed up? That's the tack [some on the DeSantis camp](https://twitter.com/tarynfenske/status/1563261005303787521) are staking. Except... the director of the \"Office of Election Crimes and Security\", who was appointed by DeSantis, [explicitly told local officials they were not at fault](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/29/despite-public-blame-desantis-election-investigation-chief-told-local-officials-they-face-no-fault-for-felon-voting-00054089). Local officials do not have access to all the relevant state-wide data, and [they instead rely on the state](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/08/florida-voter-fraud-election-police-desantis-entrapment.html) via Division of Elections for this information.\n\nTo summarize, state officials in charge of tabulating incomplete felony sentences messed up and gave faulty information to local election officials. Those local officials approved the voting registration of people with felony convictions who by any measure appear to believe they were eligible to vote. Those people voted.

The player's ~~grandmother~~ godmother also took to twitter to say that the player was called the n-word \"every time she served\".\n\nThis story hit the national papers with the predictable headlines - strong denunciation against racism, praise for Rachel as a strong person standing up to adversity, denunciation of coaches and officials, athleticndepartments, the crowd at the game, and all Mormons.\n\nBYU's AD apologized profusely, and the school indefinitely banned a fan identified by Duke as the racist abuser.
