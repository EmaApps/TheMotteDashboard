There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh).

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series.

This would be a direct act of war. The U.S. does not take foreign policy demands from Communist China or any other belligerent bully\u201d,  says [U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn](https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn/status/1553077081633873920).   \n\n- A post appeared on Jul 29 on the official account of China's 80th group of People's Liberation Army, saying [\u00abGet ready for war!\u00bb](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202207/1271742.shtml). \n\n- During Nancy Pelosi's supposed visit to Taiwan, a U.S. Navy strike group led by the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan [will move into the South China Sea](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-28/us-aircraft-carrier-enters-south-china-sea-amid-taiwan-tensions).\n\n- The Chinese army, on the other hand, is actively [relocating armored vehicles to Fujian](https://twitter.com/gusten777/status/1553107420054016003), the nearest province to Taiwan from mainland China. Unscheduled exercises will start tomorrow.\n\n- [Another word to the staff of Global Times](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202207/1271745.shtml): \n\n&gt; \"Don't say we didn't warn you!\" - a phrase that was used by the People's Daily in 1962 before China was forced to fight the border war with India and ahead of the 1979 China-Vietnam War, was frequently mentioned during a forum held Friday by a high-level Chinese think tank, as analysts warned that open military options and comprehensive countermeasures ranging from the economy to diplomacy from China await if US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gambles with a visit to the Taiwan island during her Asia tour.\n&gt; Sending fighter jets to intercept Pelosi's plane, declaring air and maritime zones around the island of Taiwan as restriction zones for military exercises \u2026 China's responses will be systematical and not limited to small scale given the severity of Pelosi's move and the damage to the political trust of China-US relations, Yang Mingjie, head of the Institute of Taiwan Studies in Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.  \n&gt; [...]  \n&gt; The 80th Group Army posted a comment saying, \"we must bear in mind the fundamental responsibility of preparing for war and charge on the journey of a strong army.\" The comment has received 8,000 thumbs-up.\n\nWell if Marsha Blackburn on Twitter and 300000 Chinese people on Sina Weibo agree, I guess this is it. Should I buy USD, gold, Bitcoin, RTX 3090, or buckwheat? This is the question...\n\n----\n\nIt's possible to frame this in a number of ways. Old clueless women and frenzied nationalists stumbling into abyss, pulling their country along; something something our rights, freedom, liberty, Communism vs. Capitalism, Tyranny vs. Democracy; Thucydides Trap... You all follow big brain bloggers who can pontificate on that (or *are* such bloggers) and I don't have the energy to go though it all. (Frankly I'm sick and someone else should write a proper post). \n\nMy hypothesis, of course, is that the US is actually ran by hypercompetent people, and they will crush China without breaking a sweat \u2013 or, more likely, force it to back down in humiliation, although they would accept sacrificing not just Pelosi but the majority of the world's population including most Americans to achieve their goal of total hegemony if that were the cost. How those competent people have paved the road to the provocation with Pelosi is the content of a bona fide **conspiracy**, and we'll never learn of it. \n\nThe war was generally pegged to happen in 2025-2026 or later, as implied by Chinese-American power differential and rates of military buildup \u2013 at the schedule most convenient to PLA. (Alternatively, the \u00abdeclining power\u00bb model [is purported to yield much the same result](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/24/china-great-power-united-states/)). Just like with AI forecasts, it was naive and didn't account for the trivial notion that interested parties are aware of this basic scenario and thus anticipate its turns. Google *can* in fact keep scaling transformers; USA can in fact accelerate the schedule of the conflict to settle it on preferred terms. \n\nAnd right now the terms are excellent. \n\nTaiwan is very defensible. According to (picked at random) the *Naval War College Review* issue from 2001, titled [\u00abHow China Might Invade Taiwan\u00bb](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2535&amp;context=nwc-review), \u201cJust to get ashore, the landing force commanders would have to improvise extensively to deal with the inhospitable Taiwanese west coast, which is mostly mud flats, with significant tidal ranges. **The Chinese would also have to contend with two monsoon seasons, from August to September and from November to April**; it would be restricted to two \u201cwindows\u201d of attack, from May to July and the month of October.\u201d \n\nMoreover, they're just strait up not ready. For example, according to the *Southern China Morning Post*, [China\u2019s Fujian aircraft carrier doesn\u2019t have radar and weapon systems yet, photos show](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3185845/chinas-fujian-aircraft-carrier-doesnt-have-radar-and-weapon). \u00abThe Fujian was\u00a0[launched a month ago](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3182032/china-launches-fujian-pla-navys-3rd-aircraft-carrier?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article), and military analysts say the process to get the warship ready for active service could take several years \u2013 from the fit-out to testing and sea trials\u00bb. They didn't rush it enough. What does this say for their chances to attain air superiority?\n\nCan they fight the US in their present state? Their main ally is in no shape to help or even lend them arms, battered and discredited in Ukraine. Their economy is buckling under the strain of Zero-Covidiocy and bursting housing bubble.

It doesn't look good.  \n\nOn this note, back in the December of 2021 Telegram military analyst Atomic Cherry (known here through his coverage of Ukrainian conflict) has said: \n\n&gt; In 2018, China was not just deprived of access to advanced chip production technology - Beijing was literally kicked to the curb on the eve of a new round of microelectronic evolution. The mainstay of this trend in recent years has been the 7nm chip process (China still has not received the technology to manufacture such chips). A few days ago, however, TSMC began test production of 3nm chips. IBM unveiled a prototype 2nm chip back in May, and is now working with Samsung on a unique VTFET (vertical transistor arrangement) technology which will eventually break the 1nm (!) barrier.   \nA special zest to the appearance of these technologies is that they will be launched into mass production at about the same time as the U.S. will finish and start up new plants in the microelectronics industry - that is roughly 2024-2025.  \nProbably not all readers understand what the evolution of chips is all about. So as not to bore you with nerdy theory, I will explain the difference in simple and understandable categories.   \n\u25aa\ufe0f 100-nm technology makes it possible to produce, for example, cruise missiles similar to the American Tomahawk of old modifications;   \n\u25aa\ufe0f 40-nm technology makes it possible to make missile launchers similar to the older versions of the Javelin or, for example, the Predator UAV;  \n\u25aa\ufe0f 7-nm technology is your ticket into the world of multi-platform kamikaze drones and compact reconnaissance drones.   \nNot to say that the PRC had any chance at all of changing the current strategic environment - but now there is none at all. \n\nAnd a few days ago we've learned that they are in fact producing 7nm class chips... for Bitcoin mining ASICs. In a year or two, perhaps...\n\nIt's like watching [AlphaZero clobber Stockfish](https://youtu.be/lFXJWPhDsSY). \n\nI am not sure how it'll go, but I think they'll blink, like they always do when this issue is raised and the US clears its metaphorical throat. If they don't... it'll be even worse for them.\n\nXi is \u2013 or [was](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/29/chinas-xi-faces-major-economic-challenges-says-investor-david-roche.html) \u2013 expected to secure his third term [this November](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_National_Congress_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party) on the 20th National Congress of the CCP.

Can he survive disappointing them \u2013 by giving Taiwan up symbolically or losing it in an open conflict? *Probably.* If his grasp on power is comparable to Putin's, he can. It will necessitate turning the country into a comparable one-man show, with crippling brain drain from leading corporations  (sanctions will follow, of course), economic collapse and irrelevance.  \nIt won't be *that* bad.

Certainly, the Red Tribe rejects many rights that the Blue Tribe asserts, perhaps most loudly the right to abortion. And the Blue Tribe also rejects rights that the Red Tribe asserts, perhaps most loudly the right not to vaccinate. I\u2019m talking about whether we have a universal understanding that the scope of fundamental rights can change\u2014whether we can gain new rights that weren\u2019t there before, even if we disagree on which ones.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this in light of the current Supreme Court majority effectively answering this question \u201cno.\u201d In three of their major, controversial cases last month, they applied a definition of fundamental rights that relies on historical tradition. I could cite multiple examples, but here\u2019s Alito in *Dobbs:*\n\n&gt;\\[The Due Process Clause\\] has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be \"deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\" and \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\"\n\nIn my reading, Alito\u2019s opinion limits the doctrine of \u201csubstantive due process\u201d to those rights that have a historical basis in this country. Substantive due process is the doctrine that courts can identify and protect fundamental rights other than the enumerated ones in the Bill of Rights (and later amendments), and it has been used as the basis for SCOTUS decisions in *Ro*e and *Casey*, as well as gay rights cases, marriage rights cases, and more. Alito would apply it more narrowly, to exclude abortion rights. Kavanaugh assures us (without explanation) that the *Dobbs* decision *definitely* doesn\u2019t threaten other substantive due process rights, but Thomas rejects substantive due process entirely.\n\nI disagree with Thomas (at minimum), but for a different reason. I tend to look at rights first through the Ninth Amendment:\n\n&gt;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n\nIt honestly surprises me that this isn\u2019t invoked more in legal arguments because it just comes out and *says* that there are other rights besides the ones that are spelled out--and by extension, they need to be protected. (For example, Justice Arthur Goldberg used it in his concurrence in *Griswold*, but it wasn\u2019t the controlling opinion.)\n\nIn practice, I think this may actually be the same as the substantive due process argument. While it reads as an open-ended grant of rights, in order for the Ninth Amendment to have any teeth, a right has to be identified and protected. Protected how? Presumably by due process. The protection that the government may not \u201cdeprive any person of life, *liberty*, or property without due process of law\u201d implies that *any* right must be so protected, not just the enumerated ones. But the usual formulation of substantive due process never even mentions 9A. (If it did, it would be a stronger argument against Thomas.)\n\nExcept there\u2019s one complication, one that Alito invokes in *Dobbs*, but I think is more obvious when 9A is in play: *Which* rights?\n\nThe Ninth Amendment was written in 1791. The Fourteenth Amendment, which is the last Constitutional word on the subject, in 1868. Should they be interpreted, as Alito says, according to historical tradition of what people said fundamental rights were in 1791/1868?\n\nOther amendments have been interpreted broadly to keep up with the times. The right to free speech has been extended to radio, television, and the internet. The right to bear arms has been extended to repeating firearms and then semi-automatics. The right against unreasonable search and seizure has been extended (albeit less successfully) to electronic communications. Should 9A likewise be interpreted broadly to encompass what people say fundamental rights should be today.\n\nNo, that\u2019s not exactly the same thing. And given the Culture War dispute on what \u201crights\u201d exist or should exist, it seems like a moot point. But I think there is a test we can do to point us empirically toward a real answer:\n\nAre there any rights that *both* tribes (in the United States) agree on today, which are not mere extensions of the enumerated rights in the Bill of Rights (or later amendments), *and* were not recognized in 1868, either because social mores have changed or because technology has advanced?\n\nIf we can name such a right, that would be evidence not of substantive due process itself, but rather that the way we *think* about fundamental rights today is consistent with the doctrine of substantive due process, either *per se* or as a consequence of 9A. But I\u2019m having trouble thinking of any. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because I\u2019m too deep in the Bill of Rights paradigm, or if there aren\u2019t any, or if there *are*, but by definition they aren\u2019t political issues, but I welcome suggestions on the question.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ii70gtf", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has our concept of fundamental rights in the United States changed since the days of the Founders and/or Reconstruction?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And by that, I mean rights with &lt;em&gt;bipartisan support&lt;/em&gt;. Certainly, the Red Tribe rejects many rights that the Blue Tribe asserts, perhaps most loudly the right to abortion. And the Blue Tribe also rejects rights that the Red Tribe asserts, perhaps most loudly the right not to vaccinate. I\u2019m talking about whether we have a universal understanding that the scope of fundamental rights can change\u2014whether we can gain new rights that weren\u2019t there before, even if we disagree on which ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been thinking about this in light of the current Supreme Court majority effectively answering this question \u201cno.\u201d In three of their major, controversial cases last month, they applied a definition of fundamental rights that relies on historical tradition. I could cite multiple examples, but here\u2019s Alito in &lt;em&gt;Dobbs:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[The Due Process Clause] has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be &amp;quot;deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my reading, Alito\u2019s opinion limits the doctrine of \u201csubstantive due process\u201d to those rights that have a historical basis in this country. Substantive due process is the doctrine that courts can identify and protect fundamental rights other than the enumerated ones in the Bill of Rights (and later amendments), and it has been used as the basis for SCOTUS decisions in &lt;em&gt;Ro&lt;/em&gt;e and &lt;em&gt;Casey&lt;/em&gt;, as well as gay rights cases, marriage rights cases, and more. Alito would apply it more narrowly, to exclude abortion rights. Kavanaugh assures us (without explanation) that the &lt;em&gt;Dobbs&lt;/em&gt; decision &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; doesn\u2019t threaten other substantive due process rights, but Thomas rejects substantive due process entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I disagree with Thomas (at minimum), but for a different reason. I tend to look at rights first through the Ninth Amendment:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It honestly surprises me that this isn\u2019t invoked more in legal arguments because it just comes out and &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; that there are other rights besides the ones that are spelled out--and by extension, they need to be protected. (For example, Justice Arthur Goldberg used it in his concurrence in &lt;em&gt;Griswold&lt;/em&gt;, but it wasn\u2019t the controlling opinion.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In practice, I think this may actually be the same as the substantive due process argument. While it reads as an open-ended grant of rights, in order for the Ninth Amendment to have any teeth, a right has to be identified and protected. Protected how? Presumably by due process. The protection that the government may not \u201cdeprive any person of life, &lt;em&gt;liberty&lt;/em&gt;, or property without due process of law\u201d implies that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; right must be so protected, not just the enumerated ones.

But I think his case is one of the best examples of the MeToo pendulum swinging too far.  \n\nSo Watson is(was) a young star at NFL quarterback, who prior to spring 2021 was known for being humble, kindhearted, and a strong leader of excellent character. Now those may be platitudes you hear about every athlete, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that these traits were especially emphasized by coaches and commentators about Watson, given that he came from poverty and was raised by a single mother who was chronically ill with cancer for much of his life.  \n\nAround February or March 2021, a story surfaced that Watson had been accused of sexually assaulting a massage therapist, and had refused to pay a low six-figure settlement before anything went public. His accuser enlisted the services of Texas mega/meme-lawyer Tony Buzbee (look him up), who immediately solicited other women who had been \u201csexually assaulted\u201d by Watson while giving him a massage. Ultimately, there were something like 25 civil suits filed against him for sexual misconduct, most of which have been settled recently. One or two of the accusations allege forced oral sex, and the remainder allege some version of \u201che tried to rub his dick against my hand, he asked me to do X sexual act, he ejaculated while I was massaging him\u201d. Additionally, 2 grand juries in Texas have declined to indict Watson on any criminal charges.  \n\nThe evidence presented by the accusers, at least what\u2019s been seen by the public, is their testimony, and some Instagram messages or texts corroborating that Watson booked them for a massage. Almost all of these women are \u201cunlicensed massage therapists\u201d who operate via Instagram, many of whom were flown to Texas from out of state. Watson\u2019s defense is that he did see these women for massages, had sexual contact with them, but that everything was consensual. He has also shown evidence that some of the accusers reached out to work with him again after the date of the alleged sexual assault, and that some of them bragged or spoke positively to friends about their appointments with him.  \n\n\u201cOnly 1-10% of sexual assault cases are falsely reported. With 25 women accusing him, the chance that they are all false is infinitesimally small! And sexual assault is notoriously difficult to prove. The women who wanted to work with him again after being assaulted are just processing their trauma\u201d. This is the argument you hear from NFL subreddit commenters, who from basically the very beginning have been thrilled to demonstrate how anti-sexual assault they are by condemning Watson as a serial rapist/assaulter/predator.  \n\nLet\u2019s take as a given that the stat about false accusations is true (I don\u2019t think it is, and definitely not for rich/famous people). Well, the 25 women accusing him are not independent events- they all have the same lawyer and all but one or two came forward after the possibility of a six-figure settlement was put on the table. And sexual assault IS notoriously difficult to prove, but don\u2019t the reasons that make it difficult to prove also make it impossible to DISprove? And to the argument about the women who worked with him after being assaulted just \u201cprocessing their trauma in their own way\u201d, I don\u2019t even have a response because I can\u2019t imagine being that charitable to anybody making evidence-free accusations.\n\nSo what do I think actually happened? Well it seems clear that Watson has some sort of fetish for sex with massage therapists.

When those unlicensed massage therapists are getting flown from out of state to massage an NFL quarterback, I really have a hard time believing they didn\u2019t know exactly what was happening.  \n\nIf you\u2019re one of these \u201cmassage therapists\u201d who has worked with Watson and you hear about this lawyer who is soliciting clients who have been assaulted by Watson: you know that you have evidence proving you met with Watson for a massage, you know that any discussion of paying for sex happened in person, you know that it will be impossible to disprove, you know that Watson will not use \u201cI was actually just flying in prostitutes\u201d as a defense, and you know there\u2019s a very good chance of getting a six figure settlement for telling a story about how traumatized you were that Watson asked you to jack him off. Why wouldn\u2019t you take that? \n\nTo me, the most plausible scenario is that the first accuser was looking for hush money thinking Watson would just pay up, somehow Tony Buzbee caught wind of this and that Watson had hooked up with like 60 masseuses in the last year, and saw an opportunity for a big settlement and a whole lot of positive publicity. Every mainstream media source post-MeToo will reflexively support the accusers, Buzbee\u2019s name will be all over the news, and you know if you just keep dragging this out you will get a settlement as Watson can\u2019t waste his prime earning years unable to play football because of the 25 civil court cases.

The [full text](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22122281-inflation_reduction_act_of_2022) is here if you're interested, a breezy read at 725 pages.  This [one page summary](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22122297-inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary) gives a quick breakdown, and [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/manchin-climate-tax-bill.html) has a pretty solid summary of the key stuff:\n\n&gt;The package would set aside $369 billion for climate and energy proposals, the most ambitious climate action ever taken by Congress, and raise an estimated $451 billion in new tax revenue over a decade, while cutting federal spending on prescription drugs by $288 billion, according to a summary circulated Wednesday evening.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;. . .  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The two health care pieces would allow Medicare to directly regulate the price of prescription drugs for the first time beginning in 2023. It would also extend through 2025 an expansion of premium subsidies that Democrats first pushed through in 2021 as part of their $1.9 trillion pandemic aid bill, preventing a lapse at the end of the year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The plan would raise most of its new tax revenue, an estimated $313 billion, by imposing a minimum tax on the so-called book income of large corporations, like Amazon and FedEx, that currently use tax credits and other maneuvers to reduce their tax rates below the 21 percent corporate income tax rate in the United States.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It would raise another $14 billion by reducing a preferential tax treatment for income earned by venture capitalists and private equity firms, which has long been a goal of Democrats.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It invests $30 billion in production tax credits for solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and critical minerals processing; $10 billion in tax credits to build clean technology manufacturing facilities; and $500 million to be used through the Defense Production Act for heat pumps and critical minerals processing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The deal also includes a means-tested $7,500 tax credit to make new electric vehicles more affordable, and a $4,000 tax credit for used electric vehicles, according to a summary of the package. Both credits will be offered only to lower and middle-income consumers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The measure also includes a methane fee that will start in 2025.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also included will be $60 billion to address the disproportionate burden of pollution on low-income communities and communities of color, $27 billion for a \u201cgreen bank\u201d aimed at delivering financial support to clean energy projects and $20 billion for programs that can cut emissions in the agriculture sector.\n\nRelevant to our discussion yesterday about Trump and DeSantis, the bill also includes \"comprehensive permitting reform\" aimed at making building easier, though not a lot of details have been released so far and I haven't trawled the bill yet.\n\nI'm pretty into everything I see here at first glance, especially the provision allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and also the investments in electric vehicles and related clean energy technologies (as you might have guessed from my posts ranting about gas reliance always exposing us to international crises).  I see nothing about nuclear power in the summary unfortunately (edit: see u/ChrisPrattAlphaRaptr's comment for details on what they are doing).\n\nI'm a little surprised at some of the tax stuff - if we're going after paying back the deficit why focus on carried interest and not capital gains in general, one of Biden's original pledges?  Presumably lost in compromise I suppose.  I've been unconvinced by the arguments that eliminating the capital gains tax will choke off investment since so much of venture capital is from already tax-exempt sources like pension funds, but possibly also they were worried about choking off investment at a time when fears of a recession are already growing.  Note that Manchin also put the kibosh on attempts from the coastal senators to raise the SALT cap, which I consider to be a plus.\n\nNote  also that this bill isn't guaranteed; Kyrsten Sinema hasn't weighed in yet and we haven't actually heard from every other Democratic senator either.\n\nThis comes a day after the Senate passing an actually bipartisan (64-33) [industrial policy bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/senate-chips-china.html) aimed at countering China and in particular onshoring the semiconductor industry:\n\n&gt;The bill, a convergence of economic and national security policy, would provide $52 billion in subsidies and additional tax credits to companies that manufacture chips in the United States. It also would add $200 billion for scientific research, especially into artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing and a variety of other technologies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The bill calls for pouring $10 billion into the Department of Commerce \u2014 which would also dole out the chips subsidies to companies that apply \u2014 to create 20 \u201cregional technology hubs\u201d across the country. The brainchild of Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, and Mr. Schumer, the hubs would aim to link together research universities with private industry in an effort to create Silicon Valley-like centers for technology innovation in areas hollowed out by globalization.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The legislation would steer billions to the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation to promote both basic research and research and development into advanced semiconductor manufacturing, as well as work force development programs, in an effort to build a labor pipeline for a slew of emerging industries.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;. . .  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The bill also seeks to create research and development and manufacturing jobs in the long run. It includes provisions aimed at building up pipelines of workers \u2014 through work force development grants and other programs \u2014 concentrated in once-booming industrial hubs hollowed out by corporate offshoring.\n\nI haven't read nearly as much about this one but interested and heartned to see any piece of major legislation passed with such substantial cross-aisle cooperation.  Apologies for the bare bones analysis but I need to dig into both of these deeper to have much more to say.

Both credits will be offered only to lower and middle-income consumers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The measure also includes a methane fee that will start in 2025.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also included will be $60 billion to address the disproportionate burden of pollution on low-income communities and communities of color, $27 billion for a \u201cgreen bank\u201d aimed at delivering financial support to clean energy projects and $20 billion for programs that can cut emissions in the agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Relevant to our discussion yesterday about Trump and DeSantis, the bill also includes &amp;quot;comprehensive permitting reform&amp;quot; aimed at making building easier, though not a lot of details have been released so far and I haven&amp;#39;t trawled the bill yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty into everything I see here at first glance, especially the provision allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and also the investments in electric vehicles and related clean energy technologies (as you might have guessed from my posts ranting about gas reliance always exposing us to international crises).  I see nothing about nuclear power in the summary unfortunately (edit: see &lt;a href=\"/u/ChrisPrattAlphaRaptr\"&gt;u/ChrisPrattAlphaRaptr&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s comment for details on what they are doing).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little surprised at some of the tax stuff - if we&amp;#39;re going after paying back the deficit why focus on carried interest and not capital gains in general, one of Biden&amp;#39;s original pledges?  Presumably lost in compromise I suppose.  I&amp;#39;ve been unconvinced by the arguments that eliminating the capital gains tax will choke off investment since so much of venture capital is from already tax-exempt sources like pension funds, but possibly also they were worried about choking off investment at a time when fears of a recession are already growing.  Note that Manchin also put the kibosh on attempts from the coastal senators to raise the SALT cap, which I consider to be a plus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note  also that this bill isn&amp;#39;t guaranteed; Kyrsten Sinema hasn&amp;#39;t weighed in yet and we haven&amp;#39;t actually heard from every other Democratic senator either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This comes a day after the Senate passing an actually bipartisan (64-33) &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/senate-chips-china.html\"&gt;industrial policy bill&lt;/a&gt; aimed at countering China and in particular onshoring the semiconductor industry:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The bill, a convergence of economic and national security policy, would provide $52 billion in subsidies and additional tax credits to companies that manufacture chips in the United States. It also would add $200 billion for scientific research, especially into artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing and a variety of other technologies.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bill calls for pouring $10 billion into the Department of Commerce \u2014 which would also dole out the chips subsidies to companies that apply \u2014 to create 20 \u201cregional technology hubs\u201d across the country. The brainchild of Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, and Mr. Schumer, the hubs would aim to link together research universities with private industry in an effort to create Silicon Valley-like centers for technology innovation in areas hollowed out by globalization.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The legislation would steer billions to the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation to promote both basic research and research and development into advanced semiconductor manufacturing, as well as work force development programs, in an effort to build a labor pipeline for a slew of emerging industries.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. . .  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bill also seeks to create research and development and manufacturing jobs in the long run. It includes provisions aimed at building up pipelines of workers \u2014 through work force development grants and other programs \u2014 concentrated in once-booming industrial hubs hollowed out by corporate offshoring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t read nearly as much about this one but interested and heartned to see any piece of major legislation passed with such substantial cross-aisle cooperation.  Apologies for the bare bones analysis but I need to dig into both of these deeper to have much more to say.

When it launched, it was the first service to really make the disappearing pic/video big, and that made it popular with teenagers/20-somethings who wanted to send pictures that they might be embarrassed by later. Besides the obvious sexting use-case (the privacy was of course much worse than promised), I also recall having a lot of male friends that loved to send me pictures of their giant poops as a gag, and people liked to use it at parties to send drunken videos that wouldn't last any longer than necessary. Its use was always casual, no one wrote a thesis on Snapchat the way they have on Twitter/Reddit or made art on it the way they have on Instagram/TikTok.

Somebody is going to, or already has, lost a lot of money on this.\n\nAnd it's summer, so I'm thinking of summer trips to the Jersey Shore as a kid, and the Surf Mall on the boardwalk that was like a big pseudo-department store with every summer fad or gimmick of the year. I think I've been inside it most years since about 1998 or so, and every year the majority of their entire stock of stuff is different. One year it's drug rug hoodies, the next year it is marvel themed sweatshirts, the next everything is in a certain shade of pink. Baseball cards become Pokemon cards become YuGiOh cards become Funko Pops (I think? I'm still not entirely sure what those are beyond hearing them in sneers) comes all the way back around to first edition Holo Charizard Pokemon Cards. \n\nAnd I'm thinking about it, the Surf Mall proprietors if you asked them would say they need to make money on whatever they are selling before it goes out of fashion, and run their business each year at a profit on that item. And their suppliers would say, we're selling these sweatshirts at a price where we can make money this year before they go out of fashion next year and then we'll make something else, whether they are manufactured in NJ or in Sichuan they are able to figure out what their customer will move to. I feel like that's what we've lost in this business environment, you get a gimmick you and recognize it and you cash in while you can, then move on. Snapchat was a gimmick, it was always a gimmick, and anyone who knew teenagers using it would have said \"Yeah, this is a gimmick.\" A business like that should have been trying to actually make money off its business while the going was good. What is it that leads to this attitude:\n\n1) Is it that everyone is trying to get the next Amazon or Google? Are all these investors just foolishly playing the lottery? Are they all lemmings following a few leaders on CNBC or whatever who fell for the lottery approach?\n\n2) On a related note, cult of the founder? Snapchat's founding pair will always control 98% of voting shares, much like WeWork before them, were investors snookered by a few charismatic guys?\n\n3) Generation gap expanding? Maybe middle aged businessmen get physical fads like Pokemon cards because they saw similar things when they were teens, but digital fads confuse them because they didn't experience them. This should become less true over time, as digital generations age, but it does not seem to be. It would have been obvious, in my mind, to any 19 year old sexting on Snap that Snap was not a $100bn company for the future, it was a fun thing you would stop doing soon enough. There's a disconnect between the customer and the investor somewhere.\n\n4) Cult of the future? I'm probably more plugged into fashion than most Motte-izens, and you see this as well in fashion companies where brands are constantly decried for not keeping up with the times, or alternatively for selling out when they get big, when the reasonable explanation for the vast majority of brands is that they're big for a while and then they disappear.

A few commenters replied that this was probably because of Biden \u2013 he opened up his term by cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline, removing permits on drilling on federal lands and saying we should move towards fully green energy.  My reply was that Obama basically did all that stuff too and oil production doubled under him, so are these kinds of regulatory policy moves really that important to investors?\n\nUsers u/LeninLovedUncleTom and u/Pulpachair offered more information on how technology breakthroughs and the relatively high price of crude oil opened up the new shale market under Obama and led to that crazy growth.  But there\u2019s still a lot of shale and crude prices are crazy high again and no one\u2019s drilling.  I think [both](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/comment/ih8bt2a/?context=3) [users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/comment/ih89f6l/?context=3) made compelling arguments (if i followed them), substantiated with the articles I can find with quotes from oil leaders, that the primary driver of investment isn't really regulatory policy, it's the fact that everyone is too worried about massive market fluctuations.  OPEC cratered prices after the initial shale boom and hurt a lot of investors, and Covid saw barrels going for negative prices.  Who wants to invest in drilling more when the market could switch up on you and completely destroy your profits?  [To quote](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-18/shale-wildcatters-send-bullish-oil-price-signal-with-output-restraint):\n\n&gt;\u201cWhether it\u2019s $150 oil, $200 oil, or $100 oil, we\u2019re not going to change our growth plans,\u2019\u2019 Pioneer Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield said during a Bloomberg Television interview. \u201cIf the president wants us to grow, I just don\u2019t think the industry can grow anyway.\u2019\u2019\n\nI think here this offers us two possibilities, with two questions I\u2019d ask everyone.\n\n1:  If we assume government policy can\u2019t make a huge difference on oil investment relative to the market, and the market experiences such dramatic fluctuations that investors literally won\u2019t invest in drilling more even when it would be profitable, and that this common sense market rationale means we all have to eat high gas prices: is this not an extremely strong argument for trying to divest away from oil?  To invest full scale in nuclear and renewables (edit: and battery storage technology) and microgrids and the infrastructure to make electric vehicles possible and widespread?\n\nMuch is talked about the intermittency issues with renewables, but should the fact that Russia and China each control 15% of the world\u2019s oil production, and petroleum sales can always be used as a carrot or stick in conflicts like the current one, and that we don\u2019t have the ability to control OPEC with their further 44% of the world\u2019s production \u2013 shouldn\u2019t all this be seen functionally as an broad scale intermittency problem as well?  You can address shortfalls with wind and solar in a number of ways, like using combined heat and gas systems or only using them to complement nuclear power, but in crisis situations where 15% of the world\u2019s oil disappears off of the western markets there doesn\u2019t seem to be any quick fix \u2013 our oil companies outright say the won\u2019t drill more no matter what the president does!\n\nI\u2019m well aware this would be a cost intensive and technologically challenging road, and that renewables in particular have other huge limitations and could perhaps never fully fill the gap fossil fuels played, but wouldn\u2019t shrinking our fossil fuel dependency alone go significantly far towards reducing our exposure to these kinds of crises?  Would the eventual problems we might face in a country that invested to the hilt in electric cars, nuclear energy, renewable energy systems and decentralized microgrids be worse than what we\u2019re dealing with now?  Would it be worse than the fact that our country is always vulnerable having the pipe turned off from the outside?\n\n2:  Alternatively, maybe none of the obvious stuff Biden could do would help oil.  But let\u2019s pretend he can - what if he did all the non-obvious stuff as well?  What if Biden completely deregulated oil, cut their taxes down to zero, gave them (more) massive subsidies and promised to insure any losses from market fluctuations, slashed wages, cut all zoning laws, worker\u2019s rights, safety regulations and environmental regulations and finally got domestic oil production to rise.\n\nWould it be worth it?\n\nSometimes I\u2019m jealous of China\u2019s powerful industrial base.  Then I think about their horrendously polluted waterways and their skies full of smog and their workers paid pittances to labor for crazy hours in often unsafe conditions, and I wonder if it would be worth having to do all that to compete with them on some kind of even footing.\n\nWould it be worth producing two, three, four times as much oil, enough that we have dominance over the world price and never have to worry about this situation again, if we also had to trade away our centuries of hard-fought worker\u2019s rights? If all of our gorgeous national parks were studded with oil wells and refineries and our waterways and skies groaned under the weight of their pollution?  This is an exaggerated example to be sure, but in a world where oil executives outright say the President\u2019s normal policy levers won\u2019t change their investment outlook, it bears worth asking: how much are we actually willing to give up to change that?", "edited": 1658761324.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ihkqcw6", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow up from &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih7jtj4/?context=3\"&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; about oil prices a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the sub-questions I was curious about was why oil companies weren\u2019t investing more in digging new wells.

To invest full scale in nuclear and renewables (edit: and battery storage technology) and microgrids and the infrastructure to make electric vehicles possible and widespread?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much is talked about the intermittency issues with renewables, but should the fact that Russia and China each control 15% of the world\u2019s oil production, and petroleum sales can always be used as a carrot or stick in conflicts like the current one, and that we don\u2019t have the ability to control OPEC with their further 44% of the world\u2019s production \u2013 shouldn\u2019t all this be seen functionally as an broad scale intermittency problem as well?  You can address shortfalls with wind and solar in a number of ways, like using combined heat and gas systems or only using them to complement nuclear power, but in crisis situations where 15% of the world\u2019s oil disappears off of the western markets there doesn\u2019t seem to be any quick fix \u2013 our oil companies outright say the won\u2019t drill more no matter what the president does!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m well aware this would be a cost intensive and technologically challenging road, and that renewables in particular have other huge limitations and could perhaps never fully fill the gap fossil fuels played, but wouldn\u2019t shrinking our fossil fuel dependency alone go significantly far towards reducing our exposure to these kinds of crises?  Would the eventual problems we might face in a country that invested to the hilt in electric cars, nuclear energy, renewable energy systems and decentralized microgrids be worse than what we\u2019re dealing with now?  Would it be worse than the fact that our country is always vulnerable having the pipe turned off from the outside?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2:  Alternatively, maybe none of the obvious stuff Biden could do would help oil.  But let\u2019s pretend he can - what if he did all the non-obvious stuff as well?  What if Biden completely deregulated oil, cut their taxes down to zero, gave them (more) massive subsidies and promised to insure any losses from market fluctuations, slashed wages, cut all zoning laws, worker\u2019s rights, safety regulations and environmental regulations and finally got domestic oil production to rise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would it be worth it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I\u2019m jealous of China\u2019s powerful industrial base.  Then I think about their horrendously polluted waterways and their skies full of smog and their workers paid pittances to labor for crazy hours in often unsafe conditions, and I wonder if it would be worth having to do all that to compete with them on some kind of even footing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would it be worth producing two, three, four times as much oil, enough that we have dominance over the world price and never have to worry about this situation again, if we also had to trade away our centuries of hard-fought worker\u2019s rights? If all of our gorgeous national parks were studded with oil wells and refineries and our waterways and skies groaned under the weight of their pollution?  This is an exaggerated example to be sure, but in a world where oil executives outright say the President\u2019s normal policy levers won\u2019t change their investment outlook, it bears worth asking: how much are we actually willing to give up to change that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihkqcw6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1658755905.0, "author_flair_text": "Not a big culture war guy", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_w7h8wa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 21}}], "before": null}}]
