['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 08, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wj1cwt", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1659939308.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

From one perspective, anything that helps fossil fuels in any way is absolutely forbidden, therefore, this is a bad idea; from the other, we &lt;a href=\"https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Modeling-the-Inflation-Reduction-Act-with-the-US-Energy-Policy-Simulator_August.pdf\"&gt;see that the policy bundle reduces 24 tons of emissions for every ton it adds&lt;/a&gt;, so it&amp;#39;s net good, period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a persistent belief on the left that there&amp;#39;s a vast disaffected left-wing mass of voters who would show up for a sufficiently inspiring candidate. This was shown to be false when Sanders ran in 2016 and again in 2020, but it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;sticky&lt;/em&gt; because it&amp;#39;s nice to believe that everyone&amp;#39;s silently on your side. Similarly, this portion of the left has been very keen to believe that &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/KateAronoff/status/1089327906139054080\"&gt;we can crush fossil-fuel supply, and it&amp;#39;ll only affect billionaires&lt;/a&gt;. The political reality is, of course, different, in that people &lt;a href=\"https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Presidential-Approval-and-Gas-Prices.pdf\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;really hate&lt;/em&gt; high energy prices&lt;/a&gt;, which is how supply restrictions manifest themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to emphasize, not everyone on the climate-hawk left is taking the deontological approach. But it&amp;#39;s certainly &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; to see this split.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijmqb7h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1660078486.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wj1cwt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ijidq33", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ijidq33", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "rokosbasilica", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660002038.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wj1cwt", "score": 57, "author_fullname": "t2_9dntitwz", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "The FBI just [raided Mar A Lago](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/mar-a-lago-search-warrant-fbi-donald-trump/index.html) (Trump's home).\n\nThis doesn't seem quite *unbelievably* stupid, since, there is a lot of very stupid things that have already happened, so I can believe it, but...man this just seems like a really dumb thing to do.\n\nThere's no way this isn't a major step on an escalatory spiral.

We\u2019re posting everything as top levels here so everyone sees them, but later you can also see all of the fleshed out entries together at the bottom of [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative_analysis_of_the_inflation_reduction/). Thanks to u/xablor for coming up with the idea to do this and for setting up the whole collaborative analysis.  My section is taxes.\n\n**PART 1\u2014CORPORATE TAX REFORM**\n\nThe corporate tax in the Inflation Reduction Act announces a new tax of 15% on book income, so your earnings prior to taxes, deductions, etc.  Basically, if the 15% tax on book income is higher than what they a corporation owes on their normal taxes, then that corporation has to add the difference between the two amounts on their tax bill and pay the total sum.  The idea here is to target corporations which are paying little to no taxes because of loopholes.\n\nHowever, this only applies to corporations that have had $1 billion in taxabale income (averaged across the previous three years, unless the company has existed for less than three years, then averaged across however long they have been around).  These corporations can almost be exempt if they are experiencing a change in ownership, or if they had a certain number of (as yet undetermined) consecutive years earning below $1 billion, or if the Secretary of the Treasury feels like it.  Taxes are also levied on global income, so as to account for base erosion, the process of shifting profits from your high tax home country to a subsidiary or parent in a low tax foreign country. This is similar-ish to the way Trump\u2019s Base Erosion and Tax proposal implemented an alternative minimum tax on global income.\n\nFor a [critical perspective](https://taxfoundation.org/inflation-reduction-act/), the conservative Tax Foundation argues \u201cThe proposed 15 percent minimum tax on corporate book income is the most economically damaging provision in the bill, reducing GDP by 0.1 percent and costing about 23,000 jobs\".  Another [article of theirs](https://taxfoundation.org/biden-corporate-income-tax-rate/) gives a good explanation of the problems of taxing book income.  There might be good reasons why taxable income is lower (or higher) than book income, because of depreciation of tangible investments, because of stock options, because of net operating losses being carried forward \u2013 all of which might actually be reasonable and shouldn\u2019t be penalized. The Tax Foundation [offers a more specific breakdown](https://taxfoundation.org/book-minimum-tax-analysis/) of which industries would be affected the most.  Supposedly real estate is number one followed by minining, mostly because they make significant use of depreciation.\n\nAll of this makes sense but again, though, this is only a tax on (certain) corporations making over a billion dollars.  In other words, at its most inefficient this tax will only affect at most 135 of the over 6 million companies registered in the US.  Even if all of their caveats are correct, will the tax really have such wide-ranging distortionary affects for the whole economy when its targeted at such a tiny minority of extremely profitable companies?  Would those negative effects outweigh the $313 billion in new revenue and deficit reduction?\n\nOne reason to justify being a little nervous is that the liberal Tax Policy Center [is also skeptical](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/book-minimum-tax-may-discourage-investment-more-rate-hike) about taxing book income rather just raising the ordinary corporate tax for the same reasons. They also point out that while the tax would only hit 300 companies (double my findings but who\u2019s counting), those companies account for about 60% of all capital so if the tax disincentivizes investment the effects could be large.\n\nHowever, [they take issue](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/putting-jcts-score-inflation-reduction-act-context) with the Tax Foundation's broad analysis and projections of the IRA, arguing that their assessment fails to take into the ameliorative affects of other tax credits.  As for the corporate tax, the point to a substantial body of research indicating that now up to 60% of corporate profits are estimated to be \u201csupernormal,\u201d ie profits beyond what you would normally expect that are made possible by rent seeking, patents, specialized expertise, economies of scale, luck, etc. ([1](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/WP-116.pdf), [2](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.17310/ntj.2016.4.05), [3](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.17310/ntj.2013.1.09) \\- note that the the sources here are the US Treasury ~~and researchers from the famously non-leftist U Chicago~~). As long as the new tax is lower than 100% of excess profit, it shouldn\u2019t really impact investment and hiring, at least according to the [Congressional Research Service](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RL34229.pdf) and my understanding of mainstream thinking on the issue (it\u2019s possible I totally misunderstand this).  Furthermore, they [point to growing evidence](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/rethinking-incidence-corporate-income-tax) that the corporate tax is more progressive than once thought, landing more on the capitalists than on the laborers.\n\nThe Tax Foundation seems to basically agree with this \u2013 they don\u2019t use the most liberal estimates you can find but they assume that 75% of the burden will fall on capitalists and 25% on laborers.  Tax Policy Center counsels further that the \u201claborer\u201d category still hides significant progressivity because significant research ([1](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/rethinking-corporate-income-tax-role-rent-sharing/full), [2](https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/slower-productivity-and-higher-inequality-are-they-related), [3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2586870), [4](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533003769204362)) shows that growing shares of profits are now shared as income with top managers and executives, who are still counted as laborers in this context.  The corollary is that the incidence of the corporate tax that lands on labor is still fairly progressive, landing the highest on these high earners.

Thanks to &lt;a href=\"/u/xablor\"&gt;u/xablor&lt;/a&gt; for coming up with the idea to do this and for setting up the whole collaborative analysis.  My section is taxes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PART 1\u2014CORPORATE TAX REFORM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The corporate tax in the Inflation Reduction Act announces a new tax of 15% on book income, so your earnings prior to taxes, deductions, etc.  Basically, if the 15% tax on book income is higher than what they a corporation owes on their normal taxes, then that corporation has to add the difference between the two amounts on their tax bill and pay the total sum.  The idea here is to target corporations which are paying little to no taxes because of loopholes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, this only applies to corporations that have had $1 billion in taxabale income (averaged across the previous three years, unless the company has existed for less than three years, then averaged across however long they have been around).  These corporations can almost be exempt if they are experiencing a change in ownership, or if they had a certain number of (as yet undetermined) consecutive years earning below $1 billion, or if the Secretary of the Treasury feels like it.  Taxes are also levied on global income, so as to account for base erosion, the process of shifting profits from your high tax home country to a subsidiary or parent in a low tax foreign country. This is similar-ish to the way Trump\u2019s Base Erosion and Tax proposal implemented an alternative minimum tax on global income.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/inflation-reduction-act/\"&gt;critical perspective&lt;/a&gt;, the conservative Tax Foundation argues \u201cThe proposed 15 percent minimum tax on corporate book income is the most economically damaging provision in the bill, reducing GDP by 0.1 percent and costing about 23,000 jobs&amp;quot;.  Another &lt;a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/biden-corporate-income-tax-rate/\"&gt;article of theirs&lt;/a&gt; gives a good explanation of the problems of taxing book income.  There might be good reasons why taxable income is lower (or higher) than book income, because of depreciation of tangible investments, because of stock options, because of net operating losses being carried forward \u2013 all of which might actually be reasonable and shouldn\u2019t be penalized. The Tax Foundation &lt;a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/book-minimum-tax-analysis/\"&gt;offers a more specific breakdown&lt;/a&gt; of which industries would be affected the most.  Supposedly real estate is number one followed by minining, mostly because they make significant use of depreciation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this makes sense but again, though, this is only a tax on (certain) corporations making over a billion dollars.  In other words, at its most inefficient this tax will only affect at most 135 of the over 6 million companies registered in the US.  Even if all of their caveats are correct, will the tax really have such wide-ranging distortionary affects for the whole economy when its targeted at such a tiny minority of extremely profitable companies?  Would those negative effects outweigh the $313 billion in new revenue and deficit reduction?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One reason to justify being a little nervous is that the liberal Tax Policy Center &lt;a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/book-minimum-tax-may-discourage-investment-more-rate-hike\"&gt;is also skeptical&lt;/a&gt; about taxing book income rather just raising the ordinary corporate tax for the same reasons. They also point out that while the tax would only hit 300 companies (double my findings but who\u2019s counting), those companies account for about 60% of all capital so if the tax disincentivizes investment the effects could be large.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/putting-jcts-score-inflation-reduction-act-context\"&gt;they take issue&lt;/a&gt; with the Tax Foundation&amp;#39;s broad analysis and projections of the IRA, arguing that their assessment fails to take into the ameliorative affects of other tax credits.  As for the corporate tax, the point to a substantial body of research indicating that now up to 60% of corporate profits are estimated to be \u201csupernormal,\u201d ie profits beyond what you would normally expect that are made possible by rent seeking, patents, specialized expertise, economies of scale, luck, etc. (&lt;a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/WP-116.pdf\"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.17310/ntj.2016.4.05\"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.17310/ntj.2013.1.09\"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; - note that the the sources here are the US Treasury &lt;del&gt;and researchers from the famously non-leftist U Chicago&lt;/del&gt;). As long as the new tax is lower than 100% of excess profit, it shouldn\u2019t really impact investment and hiring, at least according to the &lt;a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RL34229.pdf\"&gt;Congressional Research Service&lt;/a&gt; and my understanding of mainstream thinking on the issue (it\u2019s possible I totally misunderstand this).  Furthermore, they &lt;a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/rethinking-incidence-corporate-income-tax\"&gt;point to growing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the corporate tax is more progressive than once thought, landing more on the capitalists than on the laborers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tax Foundation seems to basically agree with this \u2013 they don\u2019t use the most liberal estimates you can find but they assume that 75% of the burden will fall on capitalists and 25% on laborers.  Tax Policy Center counsels further that the \u201claborer\u201d category still hides significant progressivity because significant research (&lt;a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/rethinking-corporate-income-tax-role-rent-sharing/full\"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/slower-productivity-and-higher-inequality-are-they-related\"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2586870\"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533003769204362\"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;) shows that growing shares of profits are now shared as income with top managers and executives, who are still counted as laborers in this context.

It allows players on both private and Mojang-hosted multiplayer servers to flag inappropriate messages in chat for review by Mojang investigators, potentially resulting in suspensions and bans for players that violate Minecraft's community guidelines even on self-hosted servers. Fans are worried that the system will result in player bans for messages taken out of context, and more broadly that it gives Microsoft too much power to dictate the content of discussions on its platform.\n\nMore details from Mojang (aka Microsoft) [here](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/7317376541197), or a more technical breakdown of an earlier implementation from the weekly builds [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20220630085634/https://blog.bithole.dev/mc-report.html).\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the game's online mode, Minecraft (way back in 2009) originally focused on privately-run servers, and while there's a subscription service for company-run Realms servers (starting in 2013, before the Microsoft buyout), and a small industry of third-party management tools, some [better](https://chs.gg/) and some worse, but either way, the majority of servers are effectively managed by non-Mojang and non-Microsoft employees.  People playing on such machines only interface directly with Microsoft services to login and to download updates (and, uh, for everything in Windows).\n\nMost of these servers are _small_.  It's theoretically possible to run a 'large' server or server cluster -- [HyPixel's count is famously high](https://hypixel.krashnz.com/) -- but this usually involves some combination of throwing obscene amounts of RAM at the problem, using an extremely customized version of the server, and/or [clustering approaches](https://velocitypowered.com/wiki).  For a single dedicated server machine or even mid-end cloud instance, it's very hard to scale past ~200 simultaneous users: modded environments tend to struggle badly in the [~100](https://twitter.com/CuriousCalamari/status/1535364691488395266) users range, and the most recent BlanketCon (a modder convention server focused on a higher-performance culture war split called Quilt that derived from the high-performance internal-frustration split called Fabric) [managed to get a workable server to 170 concurrent players](https://hackmd.io/@LemmaEOF/blanketcon-22-postmortem#Performance-Performance-Performance) by live-patching out stuff like Achievements.  Most servers more likely run 5-40 concurrent players, usually favoring the low end.\n\nRunning a server is balancing act beyond the technical aspects.  Even without mods or PvP, it's trivially easy for a bad actor to grief other players at least some of the time, and even well-meaning players can unintentionally create lag bombs or overflow NBT.  And people are people, for better or worse.  In turn, server operators are dictators by nature; there is little appeal past whoever controls the electrical bill or the file system, and it's historically be constrained to the sort of thing that involve the FBI.\n\nWhich runs into some complications, when you're talking about a game a) is at least somewhat marketed toward kids, b) [that supports chat and a nearly-unfettered voxel sandbox](https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg/status/604411327583375361), c) has or had prominent cultural trends toward [anti-censorship](https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/en).  Not _new_ problems -- kids wandering unobserved into the wrong IRC channel, PHPbb or USENET/BBC are stories nearly as old as the internet themselves, and [inspirations behind federal legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act) older than Java 1.2 -- but ones somewhat more prominent when the majority of the children in the country play the game.So there's [definitely](https://twitter.com/politicalmath/status/1391282599046238208) a [problem](https://twitter.com/mattcarriere/status/1391290583486922757) that this is [pointed](https://twitter.com/gigaherz/status/1553076537179660288) at solving, or at least helping solve.\n\nBut there are some tradeoffs.  There are some technical efforts built into the system to avoid or at least reduce manipulation, but ultimately this is a field where not just one client, but also the server and the other client may be in the hands of the enemy -- early attempts to manipulate it are [allegedly failed](https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1553077938639085568), but I'm somewhat skeptical that it's totally bulletproof and the rapid release of a couple patches hasn't encouraged people.  Even with the system working perfectly at a mechanical and code level, there's also just a more fundamental problem when moderation runs into culture: \"\"Is Queer A Slur\" - the greatest thread in the history of forums, locked by a moderator after 12,239 pages of heated debate,\".    There's also not a lot of trust of Microsoft, here.  The migration from Mojang to Microsoft accounts famously, in the modded community, [booted one Forge dev out for over four months](https://twitter.com/voxcpw/status/1489695958925463555).  Xbox's general moderation capabilities are not exactly held in high regard, either, and it's pretty easy to imagine that the typical server maintainer does a better job.\n\nWorse, there's reason to think it may not stop at this particular limit.  The [ADL](https://www.adl.org/resources/report/breaking-building-blocks-hate-case-study-minecraft-servers) has a oft-linked study on Minecraft moderation on the largest server clusters, and somewhat interestingly there's not very much overlap between what it's worried about, and what the new reporting system focuses on.  That [glassbottommeg](https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg/status/604411327583375361) thread wondering how Minecraft hasn't resulted in a bunch of lawsuits?  It's also about content that isn't reportable, here.  The central example where a server op might be an abuser?  Possibly handled... if the victim realizes it, and reports something that's obvious enough.  It's not clear how well this fixes or even seriously slows the underlying motivations and concerns, in the long run, in short.\n\nWorse, this handles the _difficult_ technical problems: while not a perfect solution to the questions of authenticity of messages only viewed by three untrusted parties, it's a good enough one for Microsoft to have shipped it.  Expanding this system to upload different data, or without user intervention, isn't as simple as a boolean tweak, but it's not deeply complicated.\n\nThat's not to say it _will_ go wrong, or go further.  I'm hope I'm just being paranoid, and outside a small number of cases for stuff that would otherwise end up involving the FBI we never hear about it again.  But that's a hope.\n\nThere's a temptation to label this by the normal Culture War assumptions, where _obviously_ Red Tribers would oppose the new system, and Blue Tribers would support it.  And you can find _some_ of that, whether genuine or primed by the coverage, and whether pogger-faced unverifiable claims on YouTube or hyperbolic comparisons to Gamergate (yes, really) on Discord.\n\nBut there's also people on the Quilt Discord, a place defined in no small part by its Culture War split from a different modloader, pondering about the ramifications when someone reports certain feelings about the international status of Hong Kong.  Or that, given the weaponization of concerns about child abuse applied to even the most of LGBT-related topics, that perhaps this is not a great tool to be passing to the XBox Live Moderation Staff.  Which isn't a _huge_ surprise; I've posted before about tech censorship [aimed at VioletBlue](https://www.reddit.com/r/CultureWarRoundup/comments/b7ycv5/offtopic_and_loweffort_cw_thread_for_the_week_of/ejwyhxf/?context=999) who then used that [as examples of what should be aimed at her _opponents_](https://twitter.com/violetblue/status/1112878491588939776), but it's worth pointing out none-the-less.((And, on the other side, it's not like PoliticalMath is going to share VioletBlue's perspective on what is acceptable discussion matter [when young adults are in the room](https://twitter.com/politicalmath/status/1523840050122870789).  There are people with principles, but you'd give Diogenes a run for his money looking for 'em.))\n\nSo... I dunno.\n\nThe deeper melancholy is more about the general case.  Minecraft hits particularly had because it's Microsoft's Mojang (2 billion served!) on one side and Your Personal Server (2/10 active players) on the other, but that isn't exactly unique.  Everyone knows that anything happening on Discord is between you, everyone else on the server, Discord Inc, and [the inevitable leaks](https://twitter.com/hradzka/status/1116502891689172993), but it's not like the motivations for Minecraft here will care that you're running your own RocketChat or Matrix instance; they're just smaller and haven't gotten the same attention.\n\nFor now.\n\nIt's not like this is new grounds in a framework where private or small-community utterances can end up sliced and diced by faceless team of reviewers by metrics you can't understand or contest.  It's not even particularly extreme as such goes.

In turn, server operators are dictators by nature; there is little appeal past whoever controls the electrical bill or the file system, and it&amp;#39;s historically be constrained to the sort of thing that involve the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which runs into some complications, when you&amp;#39;re talking about a game a) is at least somewhat marketed toward kids, b) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg/status/604411327583375361\"&gt;that supports chat and a nearly-unfettered voxel sandbox&lt;/a&gt;, c) has or had prominent cultural trends toward &lt;a href=\"https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/en\"&gt;anti-censorship&lt;/a&gt;.  Not &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; problems -- kids wandering unobserved into the wrong IRC channel, PHPbb or USENET/BBC are stories nearly as old as the internet themselves, and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act\"&gt;inspirations behind federal legislation&lt;/a&gt; older than Java 1.2 -- but ones somewhat more prominent when the majority of the children in the country play the game.So there&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/politicalmath/status/1391282599046238208\"&gt;definitely&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattcarriere/status/1391290583486922757\"&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; that this is &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/gigaherz/status/1553076537179660288\"&gt;pointed&lt;/a&gt; at solving, or at least helping solve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are some tradeoffs.  There are some technical efforts built into the system to avoid or at least reduce manipulation, but ultimately this is a field where not just one client, but also the server and the other client may be in the hands of the enemy -- early attempts to manipulate it are &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1553077938639085568\"&gt;allegedly failed&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;#39;m somewhat skeptical that it&amp;#39;s totally bulletproof and the rapid release of a couple patches hasn&amp;#39;t encouraged people.  Even with the system working perfectly at a mechanical and code level, there&amp;#39;s also just a more fundamental problem when moderation runs into culture: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Is Queer A Slur&amp;quot; - the greatest thread in the history of forums, locked by a moderator after 12,239 pages of heated debate,&amp;quot;.    There&amp;#39;s also not a lot of trust of Microsoft, here.  The migration from Mojang to Microsoft accounts famously, in the modded community, &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/voxcpw/status/1489695958925463555\"&gt;booted one Forge dev out for over four months&lt;/a&gt;.  Xbox&amp;#39;s general moderation capabilities are not exactly held in high regard, either, and it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to imagine that the typical server maintainer does a better job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse, there&amp;#39;s reason to think it may not stop at this particular limit.  The &lt;a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/report/breaking-building-blocks-hate-case-study-minecraft-servers\"&gt;ADL&lt;/a&gt; has a oft-linked study on Minecraft moderation on the largest server clusters, and somewhat interestingly there&amp;#39;s not very much overlap between what it&amp;#39;s worried about, and what the new reporting system focuses on.  That &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg/status/604411327583375361\"&gt;glassbottommeg&lt;/a&gt; thread wondering how Minecraft hasn&amp;#39;t resulted in a bunch of lawsuits?  It&amp;#39;s also about content that isn&amp;#39;t reportable, here.  The central example where a server op might be an abuser?  Possibly handled... if the victim realizes it, and reports something that&amp;#39;s obvious enough.  It&amp;#39;s not clear how well this fixes or even seriously slows the underlying motivations and concerns, in the long run, in short.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse, this handles the &lt;em&gt;difficult&lt;/em&gt; technical problems: while not a perfect solution to the questions of authenticity of messages only viewed by three untrusted parties, it&amp;#39;s a good enough one for Microsoft to have shipped it.  Expanding this system to upload different data, or without user intervention, isn&amp;#39;t as simple as a boolean tweak, but it&amp;#39;s not deeply complicated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; go wrong, or go further.  I&amp;#39;m hope I&amp;#39;m just being paranoid, and outside a small number of cases for stuff that would otherwise end up involving the FBI we never hear about it again.  But that&amp;#39;s a hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a temptation to label this by the normal Culture War assumptions, where &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; Red Tribers would oppose the new system, and Blue Tribers would support it.  And you can find &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of that, whether genuine or primed by the coverage, and whether pogger-faced unverifiable claims on YouTube or hyperbolic comparisons to Gamergate (yes, really) on Discord.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s also people on the Quilt Discord, a place defined in no small part by its Culture War split from a different modloader, pondering about the ramifications when someone reports certain feelings about the international status of Hong Kong.  Or that, given the weaponization of concerns about child abuse applied to even the most of LGBT-related topics, that perhaps this is not a great tool to be passing to the XBox Live Moderation Staff.  Which isn&amp;#39;t a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; surprise; I&amp;#39;ve posted before about tech censorship &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CultureWarRoundup/comments/b7ycv5/offtopic_and_loweffort_cw_thread_for_the_week_of/ejwyhxf/?context=999\"&gt;aimed at VioletBlue&lt;/a&gt; who then used that &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/violetblue/status/1112878491588939776\"&gt;as examples of what should be aimed at her &lt;em&gt;opponents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#39;s worth pointing out none-the-less.((And, on the other side, it&amp;#39;s not like PoliticalMath is going to share VioletBlue&amp;#39;s perspective on what is acceptable discussion matter &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/politicalmath/status/1523840050122870789\"&gt;when young adults are in the room&lt;/a&gt;.

I dunno.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The deeper melancholy is more about the general case.  Minecraft hits particularly had because it&amp;#39;s Microsoft&amp;#39;s Mojang (2 billion served!) on one side and Your Personal Server (2/10 active players) on the other, but that isn&amp;#39;t exactly unique.  Everyone knows that anything happening on Discord is between you, everyone else on the server, Discord Inc, and &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/hradzka/status/1116502891689172993\"&gt;the inevitable leaks&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#39;s not like the motivations for Minecraft here will care that you&amp;#39;re running your own RocketChat or Matrix instance; they&amp;#39;re just smaller and haven&amp;#39;t gotten the same attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like this is new grounds in a framework where private or small-community utterances can end up sliced and diced by faceless team of reviewers by metrics you can&amp;#39;t understand or contest.  It&amp;#39;s not even particularly extreme as such goes.

It is admittedly based on my own observations, with my very biased samples, so please take it with a grain of salt.\n\nAs a woman from a south american country who migrated to a Nordic country, I had expectations about what it would be like to live in a more progressive society when it comes to gender roles. Nordic countries are well known for their advances in gender equality, with men and women playing very similar roles in parenting, the work environment, politics, and so on.\n\nAnd I was not disappointed. To my experience, this is true. However it surprised me to find out there are aspects in which people seem to spontaneously segregate themselves with a strong gender bias, much more than in comparatively more sexist countries such as my homeland.\n\nOne of them is in the STEM work field. I have noticed an even lower percentage of women working in this area. And even among those who work in the field, there seems to be a tendency for them to work more in management and other \"people oriented\" roles instead of pure technical tasks. Similarly, nurses are in their vast majority women. Bus drivers, more mixed than in other countries. And so so on.\n\nWhen I asked nordic people about the reasons of that phenomenon, many shared the same opinion. With a small pay gap between different work fields, more symmetrical parenting roles at home and similar work-life balance across industries, there is less of an incentive for people to seek jobs that will fit their financial aspirations or parenting schedules. And when people are more free to choose their careers based on their tastes, then the gender imbalance in some fields is just an organic manifestation of the biological vocational differences.\n\nNow, it is hard for me to imagine that the implications of this hypothesis are true. Well, if you are to believe that the nordic gender/professional roles distribution is at least closer to the baseline biologically oriented distribution, then what cultural pressures are driving proportionally more developing countries women towards STEM? An overwhelming societal pressure to be well succeeded financially? Does not seem to be the case. And more developing countries men towards, say, nursing?\n\nMaybe to understand this matter we should look at another social phenomenon. Again, something that I empirically observe and have no data to support. But I feel there is a strong gender segregation that starts much earlier, at school and familiar circles.\n\nIt is common to see groups of girls or boys in the street, hardly ever gender mixed. Even in kindergarten hangouts - a common view in nordic streets - isles of pink or blue little dots, no noticeable intersections.\n\nI can't help comparing that to my own developing country middle class childhood. We were not struck by poverty, by all means. But let's say my parents had greater concerns than surrounding their little girl with pink and unicorns.

It is admittedly based on my own observations, with my very biased samples, so please take it with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a woman from a south american country who migrated to a Nordic country, I had expectations about what it would be like to live in a more progressive society when it comes to gender roles. Nordic countries are well known for their advances in gender equality, with men and women playing very similar roles in parenting, the work environment, politics, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I was not disappointed. To my experience, this is true. However it surprised me to find out there are aspects in which people seem to spontaneously segregate themselves with a strong gender bias, much more than in comparatively more sexist countries such as my homeland.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of them is in the STEM work field. I have noticed an even lower percentage of women working in this area. And even among those who work in the field, there seems to be a tendency for them to work more in management and other &amp;quot;people oriented&amp;quot; roles instead of pure technical tasks. Similarly, nurses are in their vast majority women. Bus drivers, more mixed than in other countries. And so so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I asked nordic people about the reasons of that phenomenon, many shared the same opinion. With a small pay gap between different work fields, more symmetrical parenting roles at home and similar work-life balance across industries, there is less of an incentive for people to seek jobs that will fit their financial aspirations or parenting schedules. And when people are more free to choose their careers based on their tastes, then the gender imbalance in some fields is just an organic manifestation of the biological vocational differences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, it is hard for me to imagine that the implications of this hypothesis are true. Well, if you are to believe that the nordic gender/professional roles distribution is at least closer to the baseline biologically oriented distribution, then what cultural pressures are driving proportionally more developing countries women towards STEM? An overwhelming societal pressure to be well succeeded financially? Does not seem to be the case. And more developing countries men towards, say, nursing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe to understand this matter we should look at another social phenomenon. Again, something that I empirically observe and have no data to support. But I feel there is a strong gender segregation that starts much earlier, at school and familiar circles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is common to see groups of girls or boys in the street, hardly ever gender mixed. Even in kindergarten hangouts - a common view in nordic streets - isles of pink or blue little dots, no noticeable intersections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help comparing that to my own developing country middle class childhood. We were not struck by poverty, by all means. But let&amp;#39;s say my parents had greater concerns than surrounding their little girl with pink and unicorns. My and my peers&amp;#39; reality was wearing oversized hand-me-down clothes and toys from our elder siblings - more numerous than in most families nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I observe in families here is more intensive parenting, both in techniques and financial resources.
