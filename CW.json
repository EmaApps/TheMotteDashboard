['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of August 08, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_wj1cwt", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 40, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 40, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1659939308.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

As used in this subsection, the term \u201coffice\u201d does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nThe warrant does not specify which section the allegation is for but I think (b) seems the most likely. (a) seems to apply specifically to judicial related documents and I don't think any of Trumps were of that kind. The inventory doesn't obviously indicate so to me. Looking *far* forward, will be interesting to see what kind of legal arguments might evolve around the prohibition of holding office in (b) if Trump were convicted and decided to run anyway. My understanding is current Court precedent prohibits Congress (or the States) adding additional qualifications beyond those in the constitution to offices that are mentioned in the constitution.\n\n793 is probably the spiciest section. I'm not gonna quote it in full here like the others because it's much longer. It basically lists out a bunch of subsections that have to deal with having access to information related to national defense and it being misused in various ways. If I had to pick a section I think (d) or (e) are the most likely. Those paragraphs cover anyone who has access to national defense information (lawfully or unlawfully) and refuses to turn over those documents to a United States officer entitled to receive it. From section (d):\n\n&gt;(d) Whoever, lawfully having possession of, access to, control over, or being entrusted with any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it; or\n\nThe way I read this section is that even if assuming Trump lawfully had possession of these documents (a dubious proposition itself, I think) he still violated this section by refusing to return the documents on demand of whatever government agency was entitled to receive them.\n\nSection 1519 provides a punishment of up to 20 years imprisonment, 2071 provides a punishment of up to 3 years imprisonment, and 793 provides a punishment up to 10 years imprisonment. Note that these are maximums, not necessarily what someone convicted will get.\n\nETA:\n\nOne thing that jumps out to me is that none of these charges seem to depend on the classification status of the documents themselves. I've seen some people float the idea that Trump could have declassified all these documents before leaving office but none of these charges read to me as requiring any particular classification level for the documents referenced therein. Maybe that's my lack of knowledge though.\n\nETA2:\n\nFor reference 18 USC 794(e) (the one I quoted but when you don't have lawful possession) is the one that landed [Reality Winner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Winner) five years in federal prison.", "edited": 1660338290.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ik1ibdz", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump search warrant has been &lt;a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854.17.0_6.pdf\"&gt;unsealed&lt;/a&gt; and it tells us a little more than we already knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The warrant authorizes a search of:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The premises to be searched, 1100 S Ocean Blvd, Palm Beach, FL 33480, is further\ndescribed as a resort, club, and residence located near the intersection of Southern Blvd and S Ocean Blvd. It is described as a mansion with approximately 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, on a 17- acre estate.

If your a libertarian that should make sense to you.  Here\u2019s a few I disagree with the general view on things (apparently from survey results of people like me).\n\n1. Highest ranked big disagreement is Abraham Lincoln.  Comes in as 6th most favorable.  This gets complicated as I dislike slavery but longer term he ended the right of states to secede and with it a lot of the power of State\u2019s Rights.  Personally in an alternative history I would think slavery dies in 30-40 years and a union is re-established while States Rights is watered down forever and eventually when that happened I assume a union was recreated.  Loss of States Rights makes me lower Abraham Lincoln significantly.  Tough call.\n\n2.  Aella making the list is sort of funny.  Probably least known broadly but I guess most have heard of her in this specific community.\n\n3.  Deng Xiaoping.  Way too low.  Probably because of the anti-Chinese bias today (partially earned).  But I would rank him top 10.  Hugely influential and in my opinion successful in eliminating more human misery than anyone else I can think of.\n\n4.  There seems to be a correct interpretation to me that partisan low quality sources are rated lowly.  Looking at ADL/OANN with low rankings.\n\n5.  Assad I rate a lot higher especially in the aftermath.  Simple utilistarianism when Assad dominated Syria was semi-livable.  Now rubble.  Somehow he kept everyone from killing each other.  Which counts for something in my book.\n\n6.  AOC i rank higher.  She\u2019s a meme politician like Gaetz.  Personally think she\u2019s in a process of normalizing and will end up like Nancy Pelosi at 60.  Party leader in the machine.  I don\u2019t have huge negative view of her.\n\n7.  Xi i have a similar bad view of.  And it\u2019s because I\u2019m beginning to question his competency.  Mishandling of COVID and with an authoritarian bent.  I think low competency, bad values, and extreme power makes him a huge threat unlike Deng who had extreme competency.  I would rank him lower from his already low position.  Probably third from bottom.\n\n8.  White Nationalism I rate higher.  Mostly because I don\u2019t know what it means.  And I don\u2019t think the bad version exists at any meaningful level which means it shouldn\u2019t be below things like Xi that has real power.  Same view on Kamala.  Though unlike White Nationalism there\u2019s no strong version that she\u2019s a really bad person.  There\u2019s nothing I dislike about her.  I think she got promoted to a position above her ability.  She shouldn\u2019t be in the lowest tiers.\n\n9.   The Taliban I rate significantly higher.  While they don\u2019t vote on leaders in Afghanistan they seem to have the consent of the governed because no one cared enough to fight them even when they had leftover US guns to stop them.  I will respect a country choosing to be a theocracy provided their shit stays within their own borders.\n\n10.  Weinstein I would also rate higher like Hannania.  On net he made good movies and from a utilitarian perspective he contribute more good than bad.  And I don\u2019t view prostitution as close to as bad as the people he\u2019s listed around him (trading sex for acting jobs).  Though he likely crossed into some non consensual stuff.  I just see a much bigger gap between what he did and Hitler/Stalin.  Xi I would rank next to them.   But still significantly higher because he\u2019s only genocided a little bit instead of entire continents.\n\n\nSome of my differences are probably just how he did the survey and it didn\u2019t differentiate at the lower end well.  And when you dislike someone like Newsome he gets the same score as someone really bad like Hitler.  A 10 point scale would have likely shown bigger gaps.  The scoring would scare me that we are far closer to civil war but I think that\u2019s just the methodology.  I might dislike a lot of Democrat establishment but not at that level.\n\nPersonally was waiting for someone else to post these surveys.  The overlap in communities seemed strong.

I just see a much bigger gap between what he did and Hitler/Stalin.  Xi I would rank next to them.   But still significantly higher because he\u2019s only genocided a little bit instead of entire continents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of my differences are probably just how he did the survey and it didn\u2019t differentiate at the lower end well.  And when you dislike someone like Newsome he gets the same score as someone really bad like Hitler.  A 10 point scale would have likely shown bigger gaps.  The scoring would scare me that we are far closer to civil war but I think that\u2019s just the methodology.  I might dislike a lot of Democrat establishment but not at that level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally was waiting for someone else to post these surveys.  The overlap in communities seemed strong.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he sources ideas here and I\u2019ve had conversations with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ik05nvf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1660317173.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wj1cwt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ijy0qh4", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ijy0qh4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "okay-dot-com", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1660271787.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wj1cwt", "score": 17, "author_fullname": "t2_dn1wyj86", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "How likely is it that these nuclear documents will be what Stumps Trump?

A pithy statement of it is \"Never dine alone with a woman\". For Pence, it goes a bit further and he also won't consume alcohol without his wife present.   \n  \nWhen this came to light after Pence's vice presidential nomination in 2016, it inspired a furor overnight. Some [claimed it was sexist](https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-abcarian-pence-marriage-20170405-story.html), [Kamala Harris called it \"outrageous\"](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/14/kamala-harris-pence-women-1221741), and some commentators have even [questioned its legality](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/3/31/15132730/pence-women-alone-rule-graham-discrimination).

In his opinion, movements like #MeToo make Pence's personal code of etiquette unavoidable because there aren't other ways to avoid the implied \"New Puritanism\". Quoting from [the *Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/pence-wife-billy-graham-rule/521298/), \"Socially liberal or non-religious people may see Pence\u2019s practice as misogynistic or bizarre. For a lot of conservative religious people, though, this set-up probably sounds normal, or even wise. The dust-up shows how radically notions of gender divide American culture.\" With a description as apt as that, whatever you feel about it, Pence's personal is now [certainly political](https://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=0ba7b595-8da9-4e63-a0ec-aec0639e4af6).  \n\nSo what happens when we have a society-wide experiment in forcing Pence's rule on people? [A recent preprint](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105976) alleged that was exactly what happened in the area of economic research. The TL;DR of the result is that post-#MeToo, male economists became more wary of collaborating with female economists. This effect was stronger when university policies on \"impersonal harassment\" were more ambiguous and when the number of past public sexual harassment cases at a university was higher. The effects are a bit scattered, but some clear findings ring out. Despite their proportions of the sample remaining unchanged despite #MeToo, female economists became less productive afterwards. This reduced productivity can be substantially (60%) attributed to the direct effects of having fewer collaborations with male economists, whose own productivity hasn't been affected. The effect on female economists' productivity was broad. Female economists were not less likely to work with women alone or women and men together, but they were less likely to work with men alone. This extended to new projects and new papers. They were not less likely to collaborate with untenured colleagues, but they were less likely to collaborate with tenured people, and this seems to be due to the fact that the tenured colleagues were at higher-ranking universities, which saw larger reductions in cross-sex collaboration. After #MeToo, female economists were less likely to initiate new projects with new and existing coauthors and this effect was due to reductions in the numbers of new projects with new coauthors inside the university and of new projects with new coauthors outside of their university. The same pattern was seen for coauthorships more generally.   \n\nSo this paper argues that what happens when we start practicing what we're told in 2 Timothy 2:22 is that women take a professional hit. The author of this paper offered [two](https://twitter.com/marinambgg/status/1557714978747981824) [stories](https://twitter.com/marinambgg/status/1557714981587546114) to explain these results.  \n\n&gt;Men think \u201c#MeToo means if I accidentally say the wrong thing, I\u2019ll be cancelled/fired. I\u2019d better stay away from women.\u201d Clear policies show that \u201csaying the wrong thing\u201d doesn\u2019t get you cancelled/fired, so clear policies reduce men\u2019s (perceived) risk of #MeToo. \n\nand  \n\n&gt;Women think \u201c#MeToo means I don\u2019t have to work with the predator men anymore, so I\u2019ll avoid them.\u201d If that\u2019s the story, we should see the decrease in collaborations regardless of whether policies are clear or not.  \n \nAnd, to be fair, both of these stories might be true to different degrees. Policy ambiguity does not explain the whole reduction in collaborations. Because this *is* the case, unless the authors' policy ambiguity measures weren't good enough, her suggestion that \"#MeToo plus clear policies could create awareness for sexual harassment without hurting women\u2019s productivity\" may be misguided. Sure, ambiguity reduction looks like it could cut against these changes a bit, but if we trust her measurement we have to conclude that the damage is done. #MeToo has made us all evangelicals, and women are some of the victims of that change.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ijwb99h", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second Epistle to Timothy 2:22 in the New International Version reads &amp;quot;Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&amp;quot; The principle outlined here has also been called the &amp;quot;Modesto Manifesto&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;Billy Graham Rule&amp;quot;, and more recently, the &amp;quot;Mike Pence Rule&amp;quot;.

Jones obviously moved on once the shooting was no longer relevant, but his actions led to his followers harassing the parents in question.

It's difficult to conclusively define his impact, so I can't really say if he's the originator of the hoax claim.

Of course, he added that he'd apparently love to recant his mistake, but the media won't let him. He's also said he apparently wanted to apologize to the parents, but given how many years its been, it's clear this is throwing anything at the wall to see if something sticks.\n\nThe lawsuits are not satisfying for anyone, I think. Jones' defenders can tell themselves that this trial was really only decided by legal technicalities and the actual facts were never put under examination, a similar claim to one that some people here have made regarding 2020 election lawsuits.

(See also [this episode of *Volts*](https://www.volts.wtf/p/volts-podcast-what-to-make-of-the).)\n\nThis is inside-baseball among climate activists, but I thought it was interesting enough to lay out here.\n\nThe [Inflation Reduction Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act_of_2022) is, [as Michael Sweeney predicted](https://nitter.it/mtsw/search?f=tweets&amp;q=inflation+reduction&amp;since=&amp;until=2022-01-31&amp;near=), part of Build Back Better wearing a different hat, but adjusted significantly to appeal to Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Some Mottians [are doing a collaborative analysis here](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative_analysis_of_the_inflation_reduction/).\n\nA central tradeoff is in [section 50625](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22122281/inflation_reduction_act_of_2022.pdf#page=644), which requires that for wind and solar to be developed on federal lands, two million acres of land and sixty million offshore acres of federal land must be offered for lease for oil and gas development. (Note that private and public lands are somewhat fungible, all offers are not leased, and all leases are not developed.)\n\nAdam McKay and David Sirota are the screenwriters of *Don't Look Up* (previously [reviewed on ACX here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/movie-review-dont-look-up)), with 1.3 million Twitter followers between them. They've been *very angry* about this deal. ([Example from Sirota](https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1556487558510821376), [from McKay](https://twitter.com/GhostPanther/status/1556745117838430208).) This has led to some [moderately funny beclownening](https://twitter.com/Wertwhile/status/1556278768674566145), and [is the same line being pushed by some Republicans](https://popular.info/p/the-people-behind-the-bizarre-non) attempting to derail the bill.\n\nBut I think there's something more interesting here. This reads to me as a very clean deontology/consequentialism split. If it hadn't been the leases, it would have been the [supports for keeping nuclear plants open](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-03/machin-deal-tosses-30-billion-lifeline-to-us-nuclear-reactors).
