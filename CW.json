['Culture war'](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;oldid=963768354) is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n\nOptimistically, we think that [engaging with people you disagree with](http://archive.is/LuQ66) is worth your time, and [so is being nice!](http://archive.is/hH3VO) Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://archive.is/ur3Fh). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://archive.is/FtI4S), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight.\n\nWe would like to avoid these negative dynamics. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War:\n\n* Shaming.     \n* Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.     \n* Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.     \n* Recruiting for a cause.     \n* Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or [steel-man](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) the relevant viewpoint.\n\nIn general, you should argue to understand, not to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another; indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you follow some guidelines:\n\n* Speak plainly. Avoid sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.     \n* Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.     \n* Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.     \n* Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.\n\nOn an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week, posted in Quality Contribution threads and archived at r/TheThread. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/themotte's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.\n\n----\n\n**Locking Your Own Posts**\n\nMaking a multi-comment megapost and want people to reply to the last one in order to preserve comment ordering? We've got a solution for you!\n\n* Write your entire post series in Notepad or some other offsite medium. Make sure that they're long; comment limit is 10000 characters, if your comments are less than half that length you should probably not be making it a multipost series.\n* Post it rapidly, in response to yourself, like you would normally.\n* For each post *except the last one*, go back and edit it to include the trigger phrase `automod_multipart_lockme`.\n* This will cause AutoModerator to lock the post.\n\nYou can then edit it to remove that phrase and it'll stay locked. This means that *you cannot unlock your post on your own*, so make sure you do this *after* you've posted your entire series. Also, don't lock the last one or people can't respond to you. *Also*, this gets reported to the mods, so don't abuse it or we'll either lock you out of the feature or just boot you; this feature is specifically for organization of multipart megaposts.\n\n----\n\nIf you're having trouble loading the whole thread, there are several tools that may be useful:\n\n* https://reddit-thread.glitch.me/\n* [RedditSearch.io](https://redditsearch.io/)\n* [Camas Reddit Search](https://camas.unddit.com/)\n* Append `?sort=old&amp;depth=1` to the end of this page's URL", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Culture War Roundup for the week of July 11, 2022", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_vwbj4s", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Culture War Roundup", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 43, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1657520108.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.TheMotte", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_war&amp;amp;oldid=963768354\"&gt;&amp;#39;Culture war&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt; is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines.

Anyway, let's think of it as an [artists practice](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwvr5c/grayed_out_options/).\n\nHow many extremists are consciously exaggerating their case to move the needle of public opinion?  \nHow many could be persuaded to stop if they were exposed to the actual distribution of opinions?\n\nInstead of a definition, here are diverse cases of \u00abextremism\u00bb:  \n\n1. Eliezer Yudkowsky [says that](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities) we're getting wiped out by an evil AGI with probability **\u00abroughly 1\u00bb** and nobody sans him and his frens worries enough about preventing it.  \n2. Scott Aaronson used to insist on [Donald Trump's delicate skin](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2777) posing lethal threat to his family, eclipsing even the threat of feminist trolls and sneerclub. As for the AGI: he thinks we've got it (probably).  \n3. Richard Hanania [explains](https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/why-do-i-hate-pronouns-more-than) that he doesn't *really* find pronouns to be worse than genocide, nor does he think wokism is a larger threat than, like, an unaligned AGI, but he's way more driven to tilt at pronouns and hey, someone's gotta do it.  \n4. Dynomight [suggests](https://dynomight.net/plans/) climate activists believe that geoengineering is a viable solution, but scorn it to keep everyone focused on cutting down CO2.  \n5. Paul Erlich is [still not admitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ehrlich) that he was wrong about the population bomb.  \n6. A sagely intellectual who's devoted his life to checking the influence of the American Empire carries water [for every anti-Western faction](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/11/book-review-manufacturing-consent/) from Palestinians and Hamas to Putin to Pol Pot.  \n7. Some people are very concerned about the Russian grip on the GOP. Others [are imploring of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy) to pay more attention to the Israel lobby instead.  \n8. There's a guy who's dunking on *everything* I say and calls me an illiterate schizophrenic douchebag nazi or permutations thereof. He digs deep enough into references I provide in random chats to find an unsourced number in a book-length supplement; he's my personal stalker cum fact checker active 24/7/365 (it's flattering). He never breaks kayfabe with me around, but has confessed elsewhere that my ideology (the way he understands it) justifies libel.  \n9. [My friend](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16464119/ernest-khalimov-chad-meme/) rates every anime he watches with 1 of 2 numbers, giving either 1 if it's overrated and 10 if it's not.  \n10. Survey designers recommend leaving out or discouraging the use of midpoints on rating scales when you need to decrease [satisficing behavior](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/satisficing-learn-to-defeat-the-subtle-menace-in-your-survey-data/). \n\nSee? \n\nThis can be shoehorned into Motte and Bailey, but I think here lies an important special case. \nMany advocate for the Bailey and insist it's a certainty; the former is in good faith, the latter is not. When pressed to quantify or bet, they don't retreat to some Motte but admit the Bailey is only *possibly true* \u2013 but the thing is, their estimation of the probability is higher than (what they take to be) the public average. In effect, they are **feigning** extremist beliefs to bring the median public signal about the issue closer to truth. \u00abM&amp;B\u00bb is when a boy cries wolf after noticing a fox in the grass; \u00abModerating Extremism\u00bb (suggest a better name?) is when a boy thinks not enough boys are on wolf patrol, because he has once heard a noise that *maaybe* was a howl.\n\nTaken as such, this is strictly incompatible with the core premise of the \u00abBayesian\u00bb rationalist mindset, with its ethos of Tetlockian supeforecasting, calibrating, betting and taxing bullshit and becoming... well, less wrong. Not quite so if you put it in the social context: people who act like this are not intellectual objects, passively updating on evidence, but active subjects of the quasi-Bayesian conversation forming the consensus reality; symmetry breakers, hair-trigger neurons with an agenda in the indecisive collective brain.  \n\nI am not saying that orthodox Bayesians are socially inactive: but they are prosecuting a different strategy of influence, tailored to another way of life. A boy who cried wolf lived in a small tight-knit village, and after two false positives everyone has learned to discard him; the moral of the story is he should have been humbly building credibility with verified truths and admissions of uncertainty, like [Toby Ord](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/01/book-review-the-precipice/) does. These people try to live in the world like that village \u2013 one of high-agency individuals, high trust and high value of reputation, where sources can be (and are!) discretely tracked and evaluated over their lifetimes. It can be said that in their information ecosystem, they encourage K-selection and slow life strategy on all levels: for memes, for expert voices, for attitudes.  \nWhereas Moderating Extremists are creatures or the big city, the bazaar, the newspaper, the advocacy group, the social media feed, the parasocial relationship. They are willing to burn their credibility a la PETA because they see little use to it. A cautious, credible voice is not updating the consensus, it being a muddy stream where chief differentiators are salience and raw volume. More than that, moderation doesn't contribute to building a platform on fame. Some would uncharitably say they're chasing attention for profit, and their organizations may do so; but I think they're somewhat selflessly propagating a meaningful signal in the only way they know.\n\nM-Extremists can baffle Bayesian Villagers simply by living day-to-day peacefully \u2013 or indeed, doing credible science and rising up that hierarchy too! \u2013 while insisting that the sky's about to fall. But, in village-speak, they're just saying you should look up. \n\n---\n\nThere also exist true believers. \n\nThe  problem began when everyone moved into Mcluhan's Global Village, which is neither a village nor a city. I believe there's a failure mode revealed by social networks. It's more nuanced than the basic groupthink, and probably warrants an evo psych story.  \n**Here's the simplest hypothesis in three parts:**   \n1. People like hanging together with those who think the same on various issues.  \n2. Our confidence about a given issue decays a little on meeting disagreement, but *gets reinforced more* on finding *a close match*. 2.1: This *applies to meta-beliefs* as well.   \n3. There are metaparameters, constants governing this dynamic, and I suspect they're not a good fit for a big networked world.\n\nA single cowardly boy who thinks there *might be* a wolf and insists on there being one will bounce around the village, get laughed at by everyone he bumps into, and chill. In the meantime he's spreading public knowledge that there's a Wolf Hypothesis. If someone else reports hearing a (probabilistic) wolf \u2013 then its plausibility skyrockets; and crucially, now they both feel that those not yet enlightened ought to be brought up to speed. It's almost as if they've associated by [Hebbian learning](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aao4159). Should they find a third one...  \nThis is trivial to stabilize in a small well-connected network: the wilder the claim, the harder to find corroboration, the greater the decay. But in a planetary web that's a *small-world network*, and with search to boot, you need almost-constant effort to discover not only multiple reports about wolves but [a deluge of murderous cardiologists](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/16/cardiologists-and-chinese-robbers/). And in Web 2.0, *the very same* exploration process leads you to people who are similar mentally, validate you and who confirm that forests must be teeming with ravenous howling wolves. And, topping it all, you can share stories about your local \u00abvillages\u00bb where everyone is blind and deaf to the horror and [must be beaten over the head with Truth](https://youtu.be/_n7iIYhjiSQ?t=1574). Soon that's your company: spiritual brethren, and ghosts of the ignorant.\n\nIn the limit, this causes gnosticism, the sense of chosenness and radical decisions. In the \u00abnormal\u00bb case, this stays limited to extremist advocacy in the vein of provided examples. \n\nNow I don't really want to demonize social networks \u2013 God knows this is popular enough. Not only do they connect people, but help some get their heads out of their own asses, and reveal naked kings. Consider that 11 years ago [this dumb, artless banality](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/human-plus-science-gallery) could be called \u00abexploring the future of the human species\u00bb, received funds and accolades. I feel like there used to be more of this pre-Twitter, and creepy, out-of-touch \u00abhigh art\u00bb has been decimated when social networks flattened the social landscape and allowed sharp-witted plebs to laugh in the faces of wannabe sophisticates. Consider that 15 years ago some [\u00abYale Professor\u00bb](https://twitter.com/jasonintrator/status/1547513558782681090) or [\u00abPublic Intellectual\u00bb](https://twitter.com/nntaleb) (has blocked you) could ride much further on the accumulated glory of his class or glowing reviews in press before his follies turned memes.\n\nI also don't want to equivocate between all causes of concern. After all, I also am such an extremist on a few topics, and I think I **am** right (if not 100%). \n\nStill, this model may be worth keeping in mind when you tell someone afraid of wolves to go touch grass.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iggzthc", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Two theories of extremism&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A belated meditation on Slatestarcodex CW gems (Moloch, Toxoplasma, Outgroup...) and some topics I&amp;#39;m thinking of lately: pet causes, post-rats, reputation, and steelmanning \u00abderadicalization\u00bb.

Most of these loved ones are very on board with the trans movements and I would desperately like to agree with them. I have read much and believe I understand where most of the big differences between conservatives, gender critical feminists, trans medicalists and gender affirming approaches to the broad subject. I do think each of these different contingents have their own kernel of truth but none of them really seems to by itself describe reality as I see it. \n\nThis post is about self identification or how someone answers the self directed form of the infamous question \"what is a woman\", that is \"Am I a woman?\" in their own head and my dissatisfaction with how all of the above factions approach it but mostly the gender affirming camp as they're the ones I'm most consistently in disharmony with in my day to day life. \n\nWhen I truly try to put myself in the shoes of a young person attempting to tackle the question \"am I a woman\" I am presented with a couple interlocking challenges. \n\n1. The actual definition of what a woman is\n\nFor the conservatives and gender critical crowd this is fairly straightforward. It's a matter of what set of genitals you were born with and the rare exceptions where there are defects are to be handled on a case by case basis. \n\nTrans medicalists are defined pretty much exactly by their difference to the gender affirming camp by having a straight forward answer to this question but in doing so excluding some people. A Woman is either a female who does not experience some form of Body Integrity Dysphoria relating to sexual traits or a male who does. \n\nThe gender affirming camp tends to approach this question in a lot of ways but they tend to boil down to a \"woman is someone who believes they're a woman\" and my problem with this definition and nearly all other formulations is what inspired this post and \n\n\\2. How can I, with my single point of perspective determine whether I fit in this definition.\n\nFor conservatives and gender critical feminists this and the next part are quite easy. You appeal to your physical characteristics and in the very rare edge cases(intersex and similar situations) where this is not obvious you appeal to the community to find the most natural solution expecting grace from those around you on the subject.\n\nFor trans medicalists this is also fairly straightforward. If you experience strong dysphoria relating to your sexual characteristics then you are trans.\n\n**Now the big one and the meat of this post.** How can someone armed only with the circular self identification definition actually evaluate if they are a woman?

Most of these loved ones are very on board with the trans movements and I would desperately like to agree with them. I have read much and believe I understand where most of the big differences between conservatives, gender critical feminists, trans medicalists and gender affirming approaches to the broad subject. I do think each of these different contingents have their own kernel of truth but none of them really seems to by itself describe reality as I see it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post is about self identification or how someone answers the self directed form of the infamous question &amp;quot;what is a woman&amp;quot;, that is &amp;quot;Am I a woman?&amp;quot; in their own head and my dissatisfaction with how all of the above factions approach it but mostly the gender affirming camp as they&amp;#39;re the ones I&amp;#39;m most consistently in disharmony with in my day to day life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I truly try to put myself in the shoes of a young person attempting to tackle the question &amp;quot;am I a woman&amp;quot; I am presented with a couple interlocking challenges. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The actual definition of what a woman is&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the conservatives and gender critical crowd this is fairly straightforward. It&amp;#39;s a matter of what set of genitals you were born with and the rare exceptions where there are defects are to be handled on a case by case basis. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trans medicalists are defined pretty much exactly by their difference to the gender affirming camp by having a straight forward answer to this question but in doing so excluding some people. A Woman is either a female who does not experience some form of Body Integrity Dysphoria relating to sexual traits or a male who does. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gender affirming camp tends to approach this question in a lot of ways but they tend to boil down to a &amp;quot;woman is someone who believes they&amp;#39;re a woman&amp;quot; and my problem with this definition and nearly all other formulations is what inspired this post and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\\2. How can I, with my single point of perspective determine whether I fit in this definition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For conservatives and gender critical feminists this and the next part are quite easy. You appeal to your physical characteristics and in the very rare edge cases(intersex and similar situations) where this is not obvious you appeal to the community to find the most natural solution expecting grace from those around you on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For trans medicalists this is also fairly straightforward. If you experience strong dysphoria relating to your sexual characteristics then you are trans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now the big one and the meat of this post.&lt;/strong&gt; How can someone armed only with the circular self identification definition actually evaluate if they are a woman? We&amp;#39;re each only endowed with one first person experience and are unable to directly access the experience of a member of the opposite sex to compare and contrast our internal experience.

If you're against legal abortion, you tend to be against covid vaccines.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm asking you.\n\nI will use \"pro-abortion\" to refer to the position that abortion should be legal and \"anti-abortion\" to refer to the position that abortion should not be legal.  I will use \"pro-vaccine\" and \"anti-vaccine\" a little more vaguely, but hopefully not too vaguely.  \"Pro-vaccine\" will refer to a spectrum of pro-vaccine attitudes, from \"it's really important that everyone get vaccinated and boosted\" up to and including legal mandates requiring vaccines to enter public businesses, the workplace, etc.  \"Anti-vaccine\" is the negation of this position.\n\nIf you tend to be pro- one of these things, you tend to be pro- the other.  Likewise if you are anti- one of these things, you tend to be anti- the other.  I find this to be curious, since it's hard to find a single unifying moral principle that entails both positions.\n\nFrequently, debates over both abortions and vaccines are cast in terms of bodily autonomy.  \"You can't (force me to get a vaccine || force me to carry a fetus I don't want) because it violates my bodily autonomy\".  If this was actually the key underlying principle at stake, then you would expect that people who are persuaded by the argument from autonomy in one case would be persuaded by it in the other, and we would see a significant contingent of people lining up in support of the pro-abortion-anti-vaccine position.  But this actually turns out to be a relatively rare combination of positions.\n\nFull disclosure: I am both pro-abortion and anti-vaccine, because I take the argument from autonomy seriously in both cases.  However, I also feel that abortion is a more ethically complicated issue than vaccine mandates, which fits with the general observation that there is some underlying shared assumption or psychological trait that tends to pull anti-vaccine people towards being anti-abortion, and vice versa.\n\nI don't feel like I need to provide much evidence in support of the thesis that there is a correlation between the pro-abortion and pro-vaccine positions.  It's pretty obvious to me.  Check any leftist discussion forum or news source and see what they have to say about both abortions and covid vaccines.\n\nThe correlation between the anti-abortion and anti-vaccine positions may not be quite as obvious, but I'm still confident it exists.  Consider, for example, that of the [seven states which brought a lawsuit](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/courts/2021/11/05/ohio-ag-sues-again-try-stopping-bidens-vaccine-mandate-osha-coronavirus-covid-19-white-house-yost/6301706001/) against OSHA's covid vaccine mandate (Ohio, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia), six of them (all but Kansas) are planning to [introduce significant abortion restrictions or outright bans](https://reproductiverights.org/maps/abortion-laws-by-state/) in the wake of the Roe decision.  I take this fact to be reflective of the general anti-abortion, anti-vaccine attitudes of the people who live in those states.\n\nSo.  Why do we observe a correlation between these particular positions?  Like I said at the outset, I don't know.  I'm mainly just opening the floor for discussion.  I'd like to get input from others here and hear what your ideas are.  However, I can briefly outline what *forms* a potential answer might take:\n\n**Shared underlying moral principle** - perhaps I've simply overlooked something, and there is in fact an underlying abstract principle that allows one to reason to both the anti-abortion and anti-vaccine position simultaneously, or vice versa.  I don't think it's going to be \"autonomy\".  Even though everyone will acknowledge that autonomy is ultimately defeasible, and I acknowledge that someone could support a very strong principle of autonomy while also being anti-abortion and anti-vaccine (\"I support your right do you what you want, but the fetus is a person with moral worth, and you simply don't have the right to kill another person\"), I simply don't think that autonomy is actually what's at stake for most people, based on listening to public discourse.  This is particularly evident in the pro-abortion-pro-vaccine camp, where arguments from autonomy against covid vaccines are given essentially no weight at all.\n\nOne idea I've been toying with is the idea of, not exactly an underlying formal principle, but the idea of an underlying \"aesthetic\" that could motivate the set of one's positions.  Perhaps rightists think that both abortions and covid vaccines represent the intrusion of the medical establishment into a natural, potentially even sacred domain that should instead be allowed to take its natural course, and it is opposition to this intrusion that motivates the anti-abortion-anti-vaccine position above all else.  Leftists could be motivated by an opposite impulse where they are fundamentally more sympathetic to humanity's attempts to control its own biology and environment through technological intervention.\n\n**Shared underlying interest**: Of course, not all political beliefs are arrived at through abstract reasoning, or even adherence to deeper unconscious principles.  Sometimes they're simply opportunistic.  The type of person who supports abortion, for example, might see vaccine mandates as a convenient way to penalize the class of people who is unlikely to support their broader social agenda.  \"If you wouldn't get a vaccine then you're probably a shitty person anyway, and now your shittiness is recorded for all the world to see in your digital vaccine passport\".\n\n**Group psychology**: Maybe people on the right are anti-abortion-anti-vaccine because That's Just What People On The Right Do, and vice versa.  On this model of political psychology, people join a team, they see what their team believes, and then they go believe that.  I think there's *something* to this idea, but I certainly don't think it can tell the full story.  There are too many observable patterns in how people think and reason, and it's not plausible to think that all political reasoning is nothing more than a meaningless epiphenomenon of group identity.", "edited": 1657891886.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ig9f6v6", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abortions and Vaccines: Why the Correlation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in favor of legal abortion, you tend to be in favor of covid vaccines.

My main point is that I think the argument over definitions is a distraction from more productive discussions.\n\nExcerpt: \n\nDebates over definition boundaries can be a fun conversational frivolity (Are Pop-Tarts a [sandwich](https://twitter.com/matttomic/status/859117370455060481)? Are Algerians [Latino](https://www.reddit.com/r/LatinoPeopleTwitter/comments/nxhiet/latino_alignment_chart/)? Is *Old Town Road* country music? Etc.) but they\u2019re most often deployed with other goals in mind. Arguments over definitions are often disguised queries for something else entirely. In [Yudkowsky\u2019s example](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4FcxgdvdQP45D6Skg/disguised-queries), a factory worker is tasked with sorting blue furry egg-shaped objects (called \u201cbleggs\u201d) from smooth red cubic objects (\u201crubes\u201d) on an assembly line. This job goes fine until the worker encounters a purple egg and has no idea how to sort it. The worker and his supervisor get distracted by the debate over definitions (Can bleggs be purple? Can rubes be furry?) until the *true* purpose of the sorting job gets revealed: bleggs contain vanadium ore, and rubes contain palladium ore, both of which need to be industrially processed differently. The ore processing plants do not give a fuck what color or shape their supply chain materials are so long as they accomplish the purpose they were built for. The question \u201cIs this a rube or a blegg?\u201d therefore is used as a good enough (and presumably cheaper) way of solving the ultimate (and presumably more complicated) logistical question of \u201cDoes this need to be processed by the palladium or the vanadium plant?\u201d. But without a shared understanding from both parties for *why* the distinction matters, no answer will communicate any useful information to whoever is asking. It\u2019ll remain a useless question.\n\nSimilarly, [if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7X2j8HAkWdmMoS8PE/disputing-definitions), does it make a *sound*? Another useless question. Both yes and no can be correct answers, depending entirely on whether your definition of sound is \u201cacoustic vibrations\u201d or \u201cperceived auditory sensation\u201d. Without first establishing *why* the distinction between the two definitions matters, no useful response is possible. Here too it\u2019s possible to get infinitely distracted over which definition is the \u201ccorrect\u201d one, but the purpose of language ultimately is communication, and the more productive avenue would be to acknowledge that it\u2019s helpful for distinct concepts to have distinct words. You can even make up new words (alberzle and bargulum for example) to avoid future confusion.\n\nSometimes ambiguity is intentional. Was [January 6th](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/the-january-6th-circus) an insurrection? Again, that depends entirely on *why* the distinction matters. The reason this might matter to a federal prosecutor would be maybe to determine whether they should file criminal charges under [18 U.S.C. \u00a72383](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2383). But outside of that niche analysis, it\u2019s reasonable to be suspicious of questions like this because of the serious negative connotations that *insurrection* inevitably conjures up. The question is very likely intended as a cover to ask \u201cWas January 6th a Very Bad Thing\u2122?\u201d.

SMTM's post sounds deservedly ecstatic, but it also sounds undeservedly like they think they've made a discovery.  \n  \nThroughout the article, they pepper in comments like \"If you predicted (or could have predicted) that the potato diet would cause this kind of weight loss, or if medical / nutritional science could have predicted that this diet was going to be so effective in the short term, and so easy for so many people \u2014 then why haven\u2019t doctors and nutritionists been recommending the potato diet to people alongside diet and exercise?\" and \"We understand if you don\u2019t really get this. We didn\u2019t get it either, despite reading about all the previous success stories, until one of us tried the potato diet for ourselves. Hunger vanishes in a really weird way that is hard to describe to anyone who hasn\u2019t felt it directly. So listen to all our participants who are like \u201cno it\u2019s not calories, it\u2019s not willpower\u201d. Or try it for yourself, you might be surprised!\" At a first glance, it's difficult to imagine someone wrote this with anything like serious intent, and these sorts of quotes are commonplace throughout the blogpost. They stand as solid evidence of virtually complete ignorance of this area of research. I'll explain by tackling these quotes.  \n  \nThe first one should stand out to SlateStarCodex readers who remember [this review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/25/book-review-the-hungry-brain/) of Stephan Guyenet's *The Hungry Brain*. At the beginning of Section III, Scott described a very relevant study: \"In 1965, some scientists locked people in a room where they could only eat nutrient sludge dispensed from a machine. Even though the volunteers had no idea how many calories the nutrient sludge was, they ate exactly enough to maintain their normal weight, proving the existence of a \u201csixth sense\u201d for food caloric content. Next, they locked morbidly obese people in the same room. They ended up eating only tiny amounts of the nutrient sludge, one or two hundred calories a day, without feeling any hunger. This proved that their bodies \u201cwanted\u201d to lose the excess weight and preferred to simply live off stored fat once removed from the overly-rewarding food environment. After six months on the sludge, a man who weighed 400 lbs at the start of the experiment was down to 200, without consciously trying to reduce his weight.\"   \n  \nThe study in question is amply described in the book and can be read in full [here](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb34828.x) (or [via sci-hub](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb34828.x)). It's really something, but it's also not the only study of its type. There have been plenty of studies on single-food diets, both with animals and humans. The general tenor of their results is that restriction to a singular type of food leads to weight loss. People who read *The Hungry Brain* will be unsurprised that sort of work is cited. The authors over at SMTM evidently read Guyenet (he is cited twice in the linked post), but never read his book or they could not have written that first quote. But, we know from their series *A Chemical Hunger* (e.g., [here](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/07/a-chemical-hunger-part-i-mysteries/), [here](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/11/a-chemical-hunger-part-ii-current-theories-of-obesity-are-inadequate/)), that they at least cite *The Hungry Brain*, and even had [a blogpost on this exact study](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/23/a-chemical-hunger-interlude-b-the-nutrient-sludge-diet/). The blogpost is an unimpressive handwaving exercise by way of ignoring the post-1980 research on this topic and dismissing the pre-1980 research with the reason being that results from before the obesity epidemic really kicked off won't generalize. But this criticism is too broad. In their own potato diet post, they say that they expect their results will generalize, but for some reason, other monotonous diets will not? Perhaps their criticism only applies to this specific 1965 study, although I have doubts since they focus so heavily on potatoes, to the exclusion of general dietary monotony.  \n  \nRegardless, if you read just a few pages more in *The Hungry Brain*, you will discover (p. 65) where Guyenet predicts the result of a dietary content restriction: \"The fact that sensory-specific satiety drives us to overeat suggests a simple solution to the problem: Limit yourself to a few foods.\" What is the potato diet but limiting yourself to a few foods? The quantity of research supporting this point is enormous, so their arguing that it wasn't predicted - when they have evidently read and even written about material predicting it - should be galling for them. The snide remark they make asking why doctors haven't recommended eating potatoes only serves to obfuscate the reality that it is not potatoes that made the difference here, but induced dietary monotony. (Which is different from cross-sectional dietary monotony, both in terms of causes and effects.) To answer their subsequent quote\n  \n&gt; If you knew the potato diet would work, why did you not run this study many years ago? Why are there no clinical trials? Did you think people would not be excited to see this result? \n\nIt's clear that all that needs to be said is \"The studies were done, the trials were run, the results were in, you just ignored them.\"  \n  \nThe \"We understand if you don't really get this\" quote refers to a reduction in hunger with the diet. My best guess about why they \"don't really get this\" is that they misunderstand hunger. Firstly, Guyenet explained their result very well, and his perspective is by no means unique. Secondly, hunger [follows a Circadian-like rhythm](https://eje.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eje/152/6/1520845.xml) and is reduced to a pittance when you completely restrict caloric intake. Consistent with this, [ghrelin levels fall when you fast](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/90/2/741/2836628). That is part of the standard explanation why, after a few days of fasting, you suddenly stop feeling any hunger. Even the subreddit /r/fasting [has a FAQ section mentioning this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/wiki/fasting_in_a_nutshell#wiki_5.2._tips_and_tricks). Hunger is similarly reduced by dietary austerity, and more austere diets yield bigger weight losses and less rebounding, but I don't wish to ramble.  \n  \nAs with the rest of their posts on weight and weight loss, SMTM's latest comes up short. It ignores things they've read, ignores obvious implications, mechanisms, and prior work that should be cited, whilst being replete with generalizability concerns despite failing to acknowledge predictions generalize to cover theories like their own.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ig0u4zm", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh off &lt;a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7iAABhWpcGeP5e6SB/it-s-probably-not-lithium\"&gt;the lithium debacle&lt;/a&gt;, Slime Mold Time Mold (SMTM) has a new blogpost on &lt;em&gt;one weird trick&lt;/em&gt; that causes weight loss: &lt;a href=\"https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/07/12/lose-10-6-pounds-in-four-weeks-with-this-one-weird-trick-discovered-by-local-slime-hive-mind-doctors-grudgingly-respect-them-hope-to-become-friends/\"&gt;eating potatoes, and only potatoes.&lt;/a&gt;.

After six months on the sludge, a man who weighed 400 lbs at the start of the experiment was down to 200, without consciously trying to reduce his weight.&amp;quot;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The study in question is amply described in the book and can be read in full &lt;a href=\"https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb34828.x\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb34828.x\"&gt;via sci-hub&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;#39;s really something, but it&amp;#39;s also not the only study of its type. There have been plenty of studies on single-food diets, both with animals and humans. The general tenor of their results is that restriction to a singular type of food leads to weight loss. People who read &lt;em&gt;The Hungry Brain&lt;/em&gt; will be unsurprised that sort of work is cited. The authors over at SMTM evidently read Guyenet (he is cited twice in the linked post), but never read his book or they could not have written that first quote. But, we know from their series &lt;em&gt;A Chemical Hunger&lt;/em&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href=\"https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/07/a-chemical-hunger-part-i-mysteries/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/11/a-chemical-hunger-part-ii-current-theories-of-obesity-are-inadequate/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), that they at least cite &lt;em&gt;The Hungry Brain&lt;/em&gt;, and even had &lt;a href=\"https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/23/a-chemical-hunger-interlude-b-the-nutrient-sludge-diet/\"&gt;a blogpost on this exact study&lt;/a&gt;. The blogpost is an unimpressive handwaving exercise by way of ignoring the post-1980 research on this topic and dismissing the pre-1980 research with the reason being that results from before the obesity epidemic really kicked off won&amp;#39;t generalize. But this criticism is too broad. In their own potato diet post, they say that they expect their results will generalize, but for some reason, other monotonous diets will not? Perhaps their criticism only applies to this specific 1965 study, although I have doubts since they focus so heavily on potatoes, to the exclusion of general dietary monotony.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless, if you read just a few pages more in &lt;em&gt;The Hungry Brain&lt;/em&gt;, you will discover (p. 65) where Guyenet predicts the result of a dietary content restriction: &amp;quot;The fact that sensory-specific satiety drives us to overeat suggests a simple solution to the problem: Limit yourself to a few foods.&amp;quot; What is the potato diet but limiting yourself to a few foods? The quantity of research supporting this point is enormous, so their arguing that it wasn&amp;#39;t predicted - when they have evidently read and even written about material predicting it - should be galling for them. The snide remark they make asking why doctors haven&amp;#39;t recommended eating potatoes only serves to obfuscate the reality that it is not potatoes that made the difference here, but induced dietary monotony. (Which is different from cross-sectional dietary monotony, both in terms of causes and effects.) To answer their subsequent quote&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you knew the potato diet would work, why did you not run this study many years ago? Why are there no clinical trials? Did you think people would not be excited to see this result? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clear that all that needs to be said is &amp;quot;The studies were done, the trials were run, the results were in, you just ignored them.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;We understand if you don&amp;#39;t really get this&amp;quot; quote refers to a reduction in hunger with the diet. My best guess about why they &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t really get this&amp;quot; is that they misunderstand hunger. Firstly, Guyenet explained their result very well, and his perspective is by no means unique. Secondly, hunger &lt;a href=\"https://eje.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eje/152/6/1520845.xml\"&gt;follows a Circadian-like rhythm&lt;/a&gt; and is reduced to a pittance when you completely restrict caloric intake. Consistent with this, &lt;a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/90/2/741/2836628\"&gt;ghrelin levels fall when you fast&lt;/a&gt;. That is part of the standard explanation why, after a few days of fasting, you suddenly stop feeling any hunger. Even the subreddit &lt;a href=\"/r/fasting\"&gt;/r/fasting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/wiki/fasting_in_a_nutshell#wiki_5.2._tips_and_tricks\"&gt;has a FAQ section mentioning this&lt;/a&gt;. Hunger is similarly reduced by dietary austerity, and more austere diets yield bigger weight losses and less rebounding, but I don&amp;#39;t wish to ramble.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with the rest of their posts on weight and weight loss, SMTM&amp;#39;s latest comes up short. It ignores things they&amp;#39;ve read, ignores obvious implications, mechanisms, and prior work that should be cited, whilst being replete with generalizability concerns despite failing to acknowledge predictions generalize to cover theories like their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig0u4zm/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1657736366.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_vwbj4s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 46}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_ig0g9km", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ig0g9km", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "tricksandcandlewicks", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1657731011.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_vwbj4s", "score": 14, "author_fullname": "t2_7vwwxtt6", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "A small update on the Ukraine war front - it appears that the sanctions Lithuania put on Kalingrad are [now facing pressure from an EU commission](https://statefirstnews.com/2022/07/13/update-today-breakingthe-european-commission-today-backed-down-to-russian-threats-and-issued-new-guidelines-saying-sanctions-dont-apply-to-rail-transit-via-lithuania-to-kaliningrad-th/).
