They have had Democratic governors (including the incumbent, Laura Kelly) but hey, nobody's perfect. More importantly, the state was the subject of the book \"What's the Matter with Kansas?\"\u2014which was later turned in to a documentary film\u2014which tried to explain why relatively poor rural people tended to vote \"against their interest\" for conservative Republican politicians. (I use scare quotes because I think it's rather presumptuous that someone decide someone else's interests for them, especially if they don't actually know that person and are relying on broad demographic information.) \n\nOf course, the truth is more complicated than that. I'm friends with a couple who lived in the state for several years after they both got postdocs at Kansas State University, and their initial trepidation of moving to the prairie after living in one of the hippest parts of Pittsburgh for a decade turned into an unexpected adoration. While the people there were definitely Trump-supporting conservatives, there was none of the bitterness that one would see in Appalachia. My friends reckoned that this was because there was no deindustrialization that left people longing for a glorified past America; these were simply people whose families ranched cattle for generations and always made a decent living from it and had six kids and always voted Republican because they always voted Republican. It probably also didn't hurt that practically any farmer would let the husband hunt deer on their property, in contrast to Pennsylvania, where people pay good money for private hunting leases and most people are stuck with overcrowded public game lands and state parks. And the Democratic governor? My friends said that she won simply because her campaign focused on solving the state's budget crisis while GOP opponent Kris Kobach focused his campaign on illegal immigration. In a state with few immigrants period, let alone illegal ones. Apparently, Kobach had become a punchline within a few weeks of nomination, even among people who ended up voting for him.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the citizens of Kansas voted yesterday on an Amendment to the state's constitution that would remove limits on the legislature's ability to regulate abortion. The average observer who bought into the \"What's the Matter with Kansas?\" rhetoric assumed the measure would pass handily. Professional journalists and others who were actually paying attention saw the issue as a tossup. So when the measure failed, the surprising thing wasn't that it failed, but that it failed by a 20 point margin. It's as of yet unclear what such an outcome means, whether for the midterms or abortion politics generally, so here are my initial thoughts:\n\n**1. This won't help Democrats in the midterms**\n\nTo be fair, it won't *hurt* them either, but I wouldn't expect a ton of pro-choice Republicans to start voting Democrat. The referendum focused on a single issue, but actual candidates have to deal with as many issues as are necessary. Additionally, now that abortion is primarily a state issue, I would expect that most GOP voters would prefer to have it addressed in state houses rather than Congress. This may also have an effect on the Kansas gubernatorial election. The race is currently a tossup, but Republican challenger Derek Schmidt was on record as supporting the measure and argued the losing position on behalf of the state in 2019. He did, however, temper his position by claiming that termination of nonviable pregnancies did not meet the definition of abortion under Kansas law and would thus not be affected by a constitutional change, though his opponents pointed out that any abortion legislation could define terms however lawmakers wanted. This is a moot point now, but it remains to be seen how Schmidt handles the issue going forward (my guess is that he says the people have spoken and moves on to other things) and whether this tips the scales in favor of Laura Kelly. But I'm no expert in Kansas politics so this is all speculation.\n\n**2. This may have a huge effect on Republican abortion rhetoric**\n\nIn recent years, it's been rare for any Republican running for office to say anything that could remotely be conceived as pro-choice, and the Republicans that did were almost all in New England or the Mid-Atlantic. A quick perusal this morning of comments on the Fox News website and r/conservative shows that the attitude in these places seems to be \"This is what we wanted\u2014leave it up to the states, and let the people decide. The people of Kansas have spoken.\" While I agree that this is a reasonable position to take and I don't doubt the sincerity of those taking it, this isn't exactly what was advertised when it came to overturning *Roe*. Pro-life advocates in states like California didn't want to see *Roe* overturned out of abstract support for Mississippians' right of self-determination; they wanted it overturned because they wanted people in Mississippi to stop killing babies and hoped that one day California would pass such legislation as well. Certainly, some Republicans in Congress have been advocating for some sort of national ban, despite the knowledge that such a ban would likely be opposed by a majority of voters overall. And while I haven't looked into it that closely, it would appear that very few Republicans at the state level have voted against trigger laws and other restrictions in states that have enacted them.\n\nIf the vote proves anything, it's that Republican opinion on abortion isn't as uniform as Republican politicians seem to have assumed. I don't expect a wave of pro-choice Republicans getting elected on a platform of expanding abortion access in states that have restricted it. I do, however, expect a lot of Republican politicians to ditch the anti-abortion rhetoric that they assumed was getting them votes. Sure, some will know that their base is heavily Evangelical and will have no good reason to stop, but for others who rely on a broader base and need to expand their support they may realize that the issue alienates as many as it attracts and will stop hammering on it. At the Federal level in particular, it may be more politically expedient to defer the issue to the states and leave it at that. At the very least, I would expect the constant barrage of pro-life rhetoric coming from the Right to ebb at least somewhat and no longer be at the point where every Republican running for office has to trot out his pro-life credentials.\n\n**3. Expect more ballot measures**\n\nSome states allow for direct ballot measures and a number are already scheduled, as one would expect. What's been left out of the conversation thus far is what happens in states that don't allow for direct ballot measures; some states require voter approval for constitutional amendments, but these measures have to be proposed by the legislature before they go to the ballot. If the national GOP shifts its rhetoric from \"Abortion is wrong and should be banned\" to \"Abortion is an issue that should be decided by the states\", then state legislatures are going to be under pressure to actually allow the people to decide. Pro-life state legislators might not be vulnerable on their votes for abortion restrictions directly, but they may be vulnerable if they steadfastly refuse to submit the question to the people. Some may argue that it's impractical to turn every matter of state law into a constitutional issue and that elected bodies are the best way of enacting the will of the public, but this argument isn't particularly effective when it involves what was clearly a national constitutional issue for fifty years and is one of the most controversial issues of the past two generations. If one looks at the referenda most of these states have put on the ballot in the past, the vast majority of it is stuff that most voters wouldn't find particularly interesting or controversial. In Pennsylvania in particular, the legislature has a tendency to submit items for constitutional amendment as a means of passing a sort of \"Super Law\" that's really hard to get rid of.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iitjna5", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Few Takeaways from the Kansas Abortion Referendum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kansas holds a place in American discourse as the prototypical &amp;quot;Red State&amp;quot;; it a Democratic presidential candidate hasn&amp;#39;t won the state since 1964, and a Democratic Senator hasn&amp;#39;t represented the state since 1939.

More importantly, the state was the subject of the book &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the Matter with Kansas?&amp;quot;\u2014which was later turned in to a documentary film\u2014which tried to explain why relatively poor rural people tended to vote &amp;quot;against their interest&amp;quot; for conservative Republican politicians. (I use scare quotes because I think it&amp;#39;s rather presumptuous that someone decide someone else&amp;#39;s interests for them, especially if they don&amp;#39;t actually know that person and are relying on broad demographic information.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, the truth is more complicated than that. I&amp;#39;m friends with a couple who lived in the state for several years after they both got postdocs at Kansas State University, and their initial trepidation of moving to the prairie after living in one of the hippest parts of Pittsburgh for a decade turned into an unexpected adoration. While the people there were definitely Trump-supporting conservatives, there was none of the bitterness that one would see in Appalachia. My friends reckoned that this was because there was no deindustrialization that left people longing for a glorified past America; these were simply people whose families ranched cattle for generations and always made a decent living from it and had six kids and always voted Republican because they always voted Republican. It probably also didn&amp;#39;t hurt that practically any farmer would let the husband hunt deer on their property, in contrast to Pennsylvania, where people pay good money for private hunting leases and most people are stuck with overcrowded public game lands and state parks. And the Democratic governor? My friends said that she won simply because her campaign focused on solving the state&amp;#39;s budget crisis while GOP opponent Kris Kobach focused his campaign on illegal immigration. In a state with few immigrants period, let alone illegal ones. Apparently, Kobach had become a punchline within a few weeks of nomination, even among people who ended up voting for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the citizens of Kansas voted yesterday on an Amendment to the state&amp;#39;s constitution that would remove limits on the legislature&amp;#39;s ability to regulate abortion. The average observer who bought into the &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the Matter with Kansas?&amp;quot; rhetoric assumed the measure would pass handily. Professional journalists and others who were actually paying attention saw the issue as a tossup. So when the measure failed, the surprising thing wasn&amp;#39;t that it failed, but that it failed by a 20 point margin. It&amp;#39;s as of yet unclear what such an outcome means, whether for the midterms or abortion politics generally, so here are my initial thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. This won&amp;#39;t help Democrats in the midterms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be fair, it won&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt; them either, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect a ton of pro-choice Republicans to start voting Democrat. The referendum focused on a single issue, but actual candidates have to deal with as many issues as are necessary. Additionally, now that abortion is primarily a state issue, I would expect that most GOP voters would prefer to have it addressed in state houses rather than Congress. This may also have an effect on the Kansas gubernatorial election. The race is currently a tossup, but Republican challenger Derek Schmidt was on record as supporting the measure and argued the losing position on behalf of the state in 2019. He did, however, temper his position by claiming that termination of nonviable pregnancies did not meet the definition of abortion under Kansas law and would thus not be affected by a constitutional change, though his opponents pointed out that any abortion legislation could define terms however lawmakers wanted. This is a moot point now, but it remains to be seen how Schmidt handles the issue going forward (my guess is that he says the people have spoken and moves on to other things) and whether this tips the scales in favor of Laura Kelly. But I&amp;#39;m no expert in Kansas politics so this is all speculation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. This may have a huge effect on Republican abortion rhetoric&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In recent years, it&amp;#39;s been rare for any Republican running for office to say anything that could remotely be conceived as pro-choice, and the Republicans that did were almost all in New England or the Mid-Atlantic. A quick perusal this morning of comments on the Fox News website and &lt;a href=\"/r/conservative\"&gt;r/conservative&lt;/a&gt; shows that the attitude in these places seems to be &amp;quot;This is what we wanted\u2014leave it up to the states, and let the people decide. The people of Kansas have spoken.&amp;quot; While I agree that this is a reasonable position to take and I don&amp;#39;t doubt the sincerity of those taking it, this isn&amp;#39;t exactly what was advertised when it came to overturning &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt;. Pro-life advocates in states like California didn&amp;#39;t want to see &lt;em&gt;Roe&lt;/em&gt; overturned out of abstract support for Mississippians&amp;#39; right of self-determination; they wanted it overturned because they wanted people in Mississippi to stop killing babies and hoped that one day California would pass such legislation as well. Certainly, some Republicans in Congress have been advocating for some sort of national ban, despite the knowledge that such a ban would likely be opposed by a majority of voters overall. And while I haven&amp;#39;t looked into it that closely, it would appear that very few Republicans at the state level have voted against trigger laws and other restrictions in states that have enacted them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the vote proves anything, it&amp;#39;s that Republican opinion on abortion isn&amp;#39;t as uniform as Republican politicians seem to have assumed. I don&amp;#39;t expect a wave of pro-choice Republicans getting elected on a platform of expanding abortion access in states that have restricted it. I do, however, expect a lot of Republican politicians to ditch the anti-abortion rhetoric that they assumed was getting them votes. Sure, some will know that their base is heavily Evangelical and will have no good reason to stop, but for others who rely on a broader base and need to expand their support they may realize that the issue alienates as many as it attracts and will stop hammering on it. At the Federal level in particular, it may be more politically expedient to defer the issue to the states and leave it at that. At the very least, I would expect the constant barrage of pro-life rhetoric coming from the Right to ebb at least somewhat and no longer be at the point where every Republican running for office has to trot out his pro-life credentials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Expect more ballot measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some states allow for direct ballot measures and a number are already scheduled, as one would expect. What&amp;#39;s been left out of the conversation thus far is what happens in states that don&amp;#39;t allow for direct ballot measures; some states require voter approval for constitutional amendments, but these measures have to be proposed by the legislature before they go to the ballot. If the national GOP shifts its rhetoric from &amp;quot;Abortion is wrong and should be banned&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Abortion is an issue that should be decided by the states&amp;quot;, then state legislatures are going to be under pressure to actually allow the people to decide. Pro-life state legislators might not be vulnerable on their votes for abortion restrictions directly, but they may be vulnerable if they steadfastly refuse to submit the question to the people. Some may argue that it&amp;#39;s impractical to turn every matter of state law into a constitutional issue and that elected bodies are the best way of enacting the will of the public, but this argument isn&amp;#39;t particularly effective when it involves what was clearly a national constitutional issue for fifty years and is one of the most controversial issues of the past two generations. If one looks at the referenda most of these states have put on the ballot in the past, the vast majority of it is stuff that most voters wouldn&amp;#39;t find particularly interesting or controversial. In Pennsylvania in particular, the legislature has a tendency to submit items for constitutional amendment as a means of passing a sort of &amp;quot;Super Law&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s really hard to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iitjna5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1659554409.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_wda188", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMotte", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_vkedk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TheMotte", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_iit4mxc", "depth": 1, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iit4mxc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "DevonAndChris", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1659548380.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wda188", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_l8afasr", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Sorry I do not have a better opening essay or a better link but Biden's White House has been doing anti-trust against Penguin Random buying Simon &amp; Schuster. https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/media/book-publishing-merger-reliable-sources/index.html\n\nAnd I am -- okay with this?

If anything, remarkably, British media now appears to devote more attention to these issues than their American counterparts.\n\nThis provides some support for the concept that the UK is a cultural colony of the US. Cultural hegemony is a hell of a drug.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;As concepts have become much looser, our national debate has become more divisive \u2014ironically just as the country is becoming a much more tolerant, accepting, and welcoming place.\n\nGuided by the beauty of our memetic superweapons....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The end result is a media that is simply socially constructing a very warped picture of the country we live in, which is playing an active role in driving the division.\n\nThis brings us back to my old hobbyhorse, which is that bigotry is essentially a conspiracy theory about the world that justifies (in the mind of the bigot) their insane hatreds and tactics. The parallels between things like anti-semitism and anti-white-supremacy pretty much write themselves. The construct that the world is rigged against \\[decent people\\] by the evil racist \\[Other\\] who is implacably hateful and infinitely destructive, and thus all extremism is \\[self-defense\\] is as old as group hatreds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;This has also almost certainly been exacerbated by how media today has also become far more dependent on degree-holding journalists who have usually passed through elite private schools and universities (about 44% of Britain\u2019s columnists went to one of only two universities \u2014I will let you guess which)\n\nThis is directly another point of mine, which is that this whole woke thing has been primarily a revolt of the upper-class and the upwardly-mobile against the proles.

If anything, remarkably, British media now appears to devote more attention to these issues than their American counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This provides some support for the concept that the UK is a cultural colony of the US. Cultural hegemony is a hell of a drug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As concepts have become much looser, our national debate has become more divisive \u2014ironically just as the country is becoming a much more tolerant, accepting, and welcoming place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guided by the beauty of our memetic superweapons....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The end result is a media that is simply socially constructing a very warped picture of the country we live in, which is playing an active role in driving the division.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This brings us back to my old hobbyhorse, which is that bigotry is essentially a conspiracy theory about the world that justifies (in the mind of the bigot) their insane hatreds and tactics. The parallels between things like anti-semitism and anti-white-supremacy pretty much write themselves. The construct that the world is rigged against [decent people] by the evil racist [Other] who is implacably hateful and infinitely destructive, and thus all extremism is [self-defense] is as old as group hatreds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This has also almost certainly been exacerbated by how media today has also become far more dependent on degree-holding journalists who have usually passed through elite private schools and universities (about 44% of Britain\u2019s columnists went to one of only two universities \u2014I will let you guess which)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is directly another point of mine, which is that this whole woke thing has been primarily a revolt of the upper-class and the upwardly-mobile against the proles.

Eventually, she was told to retake the oath as written, which she did, but strongly protested. This incident became prominent in not just domestic Australian news, but made it into international news.\n\nLidia Thorpe is a Indigenous woman and activist, is no stranger to these kinds of controversy has been involved with various culture war issues in the past. She's a major provocateur, and a model progressive culture warrior.\n\n---\n\nSome debate has emerged over the truthfulness and validity of Thorpe's statement. Thorpe herself stated: \"It's a fact, it's truth. It's not something to get upset about... If people are hurt by truth, then we need to keep talking truth so we can get people on board and educate people.\"\n\nOn one hand, you can argue that her statement that the Queen is a coloniser isn't true because the Queen herself has personally done very little to actually colonise anyone. This is seems to be the form most mainstream pushback against Thorpe's statement is taking.\n\nHowever, looking at Thorpe's statement in context of what else she said, she has a point. The Queen is the head of Australia, and Australia *is* a colonial state (or maybe post-colonial state), at least in the sense that Australia as a state is result of British settler colonialism, and it forms the foundational basis of our culture to this day.\n\nI think the real issue is that Thorpe is breaking, probably intentionally, a unspoken agreement in Australian society, and Western liberal post-colonial society more broadly. I think the agreement goes something like this: don't call any of us individually, specifically colonists, racists, or other bad term, and we'll agree with you that those things are bad.\n\nWhat Thorpe is doing is essentially putting her ideological opponents (which include mainstream politicians) in a double bind, and I believe she is very aware of what she is doing. Everyone has agreed that colonialism is a bad thing that we oppose. So when she accuses a prominent, respected and essential figure like the Queen of being a colonist, her opponents can either:\n\n- Just deny any association between the Queen and colonialism. This is weak because it doesn't actually refute the arguments made by Thorpe and other progressives, which do have some legitimacy to them.\n\n- Admit the Queen is a coloniser or otherwise concede to her point, which is basically agreeing the Queen (and Australia) is bad and illegitimate. Which no non-progressive politician actually wants to do, least of all because it delegitimises the very political system the politicians operate under.\n\nWhat politicians *can't* do is say, 'yes we admit the Queen is a coloniser and Australia a colonial state, but *that's a good thing*'. Well, outside of some far-right political pariahs like Pauline Hanson. But the more that Thorpe and other progressives pushes and prods and tries to break the unspoken post-colonial 'liberal agreement' on topics like race and colonialism, the more I think people will eventually just say 'fuck it, you know what, I like Australia, colonialism is good, actually.'\n\nThis story has a strong similarity to the issue of white identity and white racial consciousness in the US and the Western world. The unspoken liberal agreement for the last 50 or so years has been for whites to supress any white consciousness or identity, which has seemed to work reasonably successfully, as white rarely do think about themselves in racial terms compared to other ethnic groups. But this is changing as progressives are deliberately trying break the status quo and stoke white racial consciousness, albeit only in self-flagellating and guilt ridden form. But this runs the risk of white eventually saying 'enough, if you want me to be racially conscious, I will do it on my terms, I don't want feel guilty' and becoming actual racists. I suppose the progressives would still see this as a win.\n\nThere was a similar story to this one a couple years ago in Canada where [NDP leader Jagmeet Singh called a Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MP racist in Canadian Parliament](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-jagmeet-singh-rota-racist-therrien-1.5616661). Singh was also breaking that unspoken agreement, I believe.\n\n--- \n\nTo conclude, one interesting thing I noticed about this news story is that there was no coverage of it by the ABC, our national public news broadcaster. At least, I can't find any articles about it on their website.

Here's the [complete official translation](https://miniszterelnok.hu/speech-by-prime-minister-viktor-orban-at-the-31st-balvanyos-summer-free-university-and-student-camp/), and [subtitled video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyNVFIo23Bg).\n\nSummaries by [Hungarian portal 444](https://insighthungary.444.hu/2022/07/28/orban-causes-outrage-for-opposing-mixed-race-society-in-hungary), [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/viktor-orban-against-race-mixing-europe-hungary), [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/27/europe/viktor-orban-hungary-race-speech-intl/index.html).\n\n&gt; Migration has split Europe in two \u2013 or I could say that it has split the West in two. One half is a world where European and non-European peoples live together. These countries are no longer nations: they are nothing more than a conglomeration of peoples. I could also say that it is no longer the Western world, but the post-Western world. And around 2050, the laws of mathematics will lead to the final demographic shift: cities in this part of the continent \u2013 or that part \u2013 will see the proportion of residents of non-European origin rising to over 50 per cent of the total.\n\n&gt; In such a multi-ethnic context, there is an ideological feint here that is worth talking about and focusing on. The internationalist left employs a feint, an ideological ruse: the claim \u2013 their claim \u2013 that Europe by its very nature is populated by peoples of mixed race. This is a historical and semantic sleight of hand, because it conflates two different things. There is a world in which European peoples are mixed together with those arriving from outside Europe. Now that is a mixed-race world. And there is our world, where people from within Europe mix with one another, move around, work, and relocate. So, for example, in the Carpathian Basin we are not mixed-race: we are simply a mixture of peoples living in our own European homeland. And, given a favourable alignment of stars and a following wind, these peoples merge together in a kind of Hungaro-Pannonian sauce, creating their own new European culture. This is why we have always fought: we are willing to mix with one another, but we do not want to become peoples of mixed-race. [...] The time will come when we have to somehow accept Christians coming to us from there and integrate them into our lives. This has happened before; and those whom we do not want to let in will have to be stopped at our western borders \u2013 Schengen or no Schengen.\n\nOne long-term (20+ years) advisor of his, the sociologist Zsuzsa Heged\u00fcs (who is Jewish herself) has stepped down after the speech and called it \"pure Nazi text worthy of Goebbels\", due to such explicit references to \"race\" (\"faj\" in Hungarian).\n\nShortly after the speech people realized that it is almost verbatim from a 1973 book. In fact Orb\u00e1n mentions the book just a bit before the above section:\n\n&gt; There is an outstanding 1973 book on this issue which was written in French, and recently published in Hungary. It is called \u201c[The Camp of the Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Camp_of_the_Saints)\u201d [Le Camp des Saints], and I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the spiritual developments underlying the West\u2019s inability to defend itself.\n\nThe NYT wrote [an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/books/stephen-miller-camp-saints.html) on it in 2019: \"A Racist Book\u2019s Malign and Lingering Influence - \u201cThe Camp of the Saints,\u201d published in 1973, has been a must-read within white supremacist circles for decades. Stephen Miller, Marine Le Pen and Steve King have touted it in recent years.\"\n\nMost of the above quoted speech section is from the intro of the book, including exact phrases like \"historical and semantic sleight of hand\". Orb\u00e1n('s speech writers) basically just swapped the \"Gallo-Roman sauce\" of the original French book with \"Hungaro-Pannonian sauce\".\n\nCommon directions of criticism were 1) that Hungarians are also mixed, no population is racially pure, 2) Hungarians came from Asia, 3) it's biologically inaccurate to talk about \"faj\" (=\"race\", \"species\") regarding humans.\n\nInterestingly, or not, back in 2012, Orb\u00e1n also called Hungarians \"half-Asian\" ([HU source](https://24.hu/belfold/2012/07/26/orban-veszekedos-felazsiai-nep-a-magyar/)):\n\n&gt; \"My philosophy is that unity is a question of strength: if there is strength, there is unity,\" he said. There are other ways of forging unity - for example, in the Scandinavian countries - but he believes that the Hungarians are incapable of doing so. \"That's the only way it works with half-Asian derivatives like us. Here everyone is clever, everyone knows better, everyone has a better idea,\" he said.\n\n[Turanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turanism) and emphasizing cultural or other relations to Turkic peoples have been common over the last ~150 years on the conservative right wing in Hungary. So how does this add up? Not so well, because the text was essentially taken out of a French nationalist context, and it doesn't fit so well. The actual far-righters in Hungary, like the Our Homeland Movement have been talking about a \"Northern Civilization\" (\"from the Celts all the way to the Japanese\") instead of Western for some time now, exactly for this reason, and I guess as a way to get closer to the Russian far-right vision of Dugin's Eurasianism.\n\nSo saying that Hungarians came from Asia misses the point (well, it's arguable anyway in a modern genetic sense, and even if so, the origin was near the Urals, the border of Europe). Orb\u00e1n and the far right's problem is with Africans and Middle Eastern Muslims.\n\nHe has since stated that his speech may have been misunderstandable, and he actually just meant cultural differences, not biological. But the word \"race\" was unusually blunt even for Orb\u00e1n. He usually talks in terms of religion (Christianity vs Islam) or cultures and civilizations, not races. In fact, the Hungarian word he used (\"faj\") is now quite taboo in this sense, today it's only used in the meaning of \"species\" (of animals or plants). Another common criticism came from this angle: that humanity is one species, *Homo sapiens*. This is a very shallow criticism but apparently many felt that it's some kind of gotcha, that Orb\u00e1n doesn't even know basic biology and doesn't understand the concept of \"species\". Except that \"faj\" used to be a much broader term, for stuff like ethnicity, nationality, race, species etc.\n\nZooming out a bit, it's clear that Orb\u00e1n loves the kind of attention that these speeches give him. It's like antifragility, he thrives on being demonized and gets stronger each time when he survives these. So, since there was a possibility of difficulties at home (due to economic problems, they can't keep to their election promises just a few months after their re-election), he decided to cause some controversy so he can again frame things in this way, that all conflict with the EU ultimately stems from the issues of migration, gender, Soros etc. That's his home turf, that's the lens he wants on everything.\n\nOn Thursday, Orb\u00e1n [will speak at CPAC Texas in Dallas](https://www.newsweek.com/von-der-leyen-rips-orban-over-mixed-race-speech-cpac-still-welcoming-him-1729399), to the outrage of American media.\n\nSo, 1) Most of this wasn't even Orb\u00e1n's own ideas but took it verbatim from a book, 2) The reaction to it was lazy criticism, the nth iteration of calling Orb\u00e1n a fascist or feigning ignorance about meanings of words or performatively not understanding that by other races Orb\u00e1n meant Africans and Middle Easterners, not Uralic Asians. 3) Orb\u00e1n needed nothing other than exactly that, to be criticized for his stance on migration and gender instead of utility price hikes and tax raises.\n\nSo is he a racist? It doesn't matter because this is post-politics. People perform to get reactions, it's not about beliefs. A prominent journalist from Orb\u00e1n's circles, Zsolt Bayer (shown [here](https://nepszava.hu/3162052_nemeth-szilard-bayer-zsolt-alsoors-rasszizmus-polo-fenykep) with a Secretary of State) wore a \"white lives matter\" T-shirt just a few weeks ago. It's hard to tell what one should interpret as sincere opinions (if that's even possible for a politician to have) versus pure posturing. But it's mostly just two sides symbiotically needing each other to justify themselves.", "edited": 1659409156.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iilcoqr", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So last week Viktor Orban gave a controversial speech on &amp;quot;race-mixing&amp;quot; among other things.
