I&#39;m thankful for Covid upsetting the old equilibrium.  As such, I&#39;ve come up with a new source of tax revenue, to of course be offset by a tax reduction somewhere else.

For every employee required to commute to work more than 3 days per week, the employer pays a *commute tax*, possibly scaling with commute distance, time, or congestion, in order to offset the economic and ecological harms of unnecessary commutes.  Harms include time away from family, stress, physical accidents, danger to self and others, air pollution...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-purple-50" title="Friday Fun"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik6fadf/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-13 21:39:01 UTC">Aug 13, 21:39 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/sciuru_">u/sciuru_</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik6fadf/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">*Status: dreams and visions*

The biggest benefit of therapy for me was from preparing to articulate about my thoughts and I do that now anyways in a journal. 

So now I wonder, what about psychotherapists? Where should my expectations be? Doing research on local ones, I&#39;m concerned their specialties don&#39;t apply to me (marital, anger, adhd, phobia, learning disability, etc). Should I organize all my self notes into a lengthy character study, to maximize our sessions? And so on.

To those who have had psychotherapy, which genres of contradiction did you have (or not have) success with resolving? General insights are also welcome....</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-gray-50" title="Small-Scale Question"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijq8bd9/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-10 15:18:09 UTC">Aug 10, 15:18 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Navalgazer420XX">u/Navalgazer420XX</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijq8bd9/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">u/VelveteenAmbush, did you get redditbanned for [whatever this was](

Found a nice band of gravel &amp;amp; sand at 18 ft in one conveniently close to where I need it. If it goes down a good 10 ft I&#39;m probably set.  
I have no experience with solar, and wondered if any of our trad homesteaders had any advice about a solar pump setup for irrigation (although it seems like a lot of those guys stopped posting or left for CWR/DSL?)

Am still working out how much water I really need for for the 3 rainless months, and whether a storage pond or ~1gpm shallow well feeding into a smaller tank uphill would be better....</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-gray-50" title="Small-Scale Question"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijdkhcy/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-07 23:50:56 UTC">Aug 07, 23:50 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/bulksalty">u/bulksalty</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijdkhcy/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Two cooking questions:

Not sure if I&#39;m interested enough, but he was a pioneer in cognitive therapies. So far he seems to have added a layer on top of behavioural conditioning, where the words that people use to &quot;self-indoctrinate&quot; themselves function as a reward/punishment mechanism. So even if you use Freudian analysis to reveal the roots of someone&#39;s problems, you still have to deal with the mechanism by which those problems are reinforced. He argues that these self-indoctrinating words often hide irrational premises, which, when noticed and challenged, leads to improvement.

To be honest, the simplicity of the model (I suppose it will get more complex) raises an eyebrow, but perha...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-gray-50" title="Small-Scale Question"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijby81g/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-07 17:05:40 UTC">Aug 07, 17:05 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Difficult_Ad_3879">u/Difficult_Ad_3879</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijby81g/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Do you know of anything beyond peppers which gives short intense pain without an</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijby81g/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">y actual damage?

With obvious certain exemptions for public service announcements and the like, but no advertising generally for commercial products was allowed.

The US advertising industry alone is worth almost US$300 billion.

For example. Lets say I didn&#39;t treat a person the most kindly. Or lost my temper, or acted along those lines. The following weeks. I will get imagery of that person mutilated in a car accident. Or withering away in a hospital bed, or something of the sort.
