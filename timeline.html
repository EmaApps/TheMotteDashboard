In retrospect, it&#39;s not clear if this was meant as &quot;at the same point in their presidency&quot; or &quot;at that moment&quot;, although I lean towards the former since approval ratings of those not in office isn&#39;t usually a topic of discussion. 

In that case, this seems to be narrowly [coming true](https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/two-different-paths-41) by a few percentage points, just barely enough past the margin of error on the polls to call it anyway....</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-red-50" title="Culture War"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/ieuxana/"><span title="2022-07-04 20:10:04 UTC">Jul 04, 20:10 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/MustPavloveDogs.html">u/MustPavloveDogs</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/ieuxana/" class="extlink">I love reading and thinking about the future of robotics and artificial intellig</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/ieuxana/" class="text-gray-500">ence, and am a fan of works such as Blade Runner/Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, iRobot, and other media that explores the possibilities of artificial intelligence.

For most of my adult life, I wasn&#39;t really interested in romance, relationships, or women in general. This has recently changed. I&#39;ve grown increasingly interested about the idea of falling in love and marrying someone. There are a number of reasons for this. Lately, more and more frequently I&#39;ve been feeling unhappy about being alone and lacking connections, and I like the idea of someone genuinely feeling attracted to me. I sometimes feel like my current life is pointless overall; creating a family and fathering children feels like a good way of making myself feel that I&#39;ve amounted to something. And, to be honest, I want to actually share my sexuality with another livin...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-gray-50" title="Small-Scale Question"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ieo612g/"><span title="2022-07-03 06:54:57 UTC">Jul 03, 06:54 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/slider5876.html">u/slider5876</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ieo612g/" class="extlink">Took a flight yesterday.

Serving meals on flights makes absolutely no sense, but at the same time I kind of miss it.  It had to be expensive to serve meals on flights because it’s literally added weight and taking up expensive space.  No one on the ground would pay the price I think it costs.  My guess is $20-30 a meal.  They are sort of like MRE for the military.  Very specific portion sizes.  Supposedly the portion size that a person is suppose to eat; which is smaller than what eat but then you had more courses than I eat.

From nostalgia perspective the food was different than what you would buy on the ground.  It was optimized to taste ok in the air.

There was one small wrinkle, though, which was that he had scheduled a video shoot with *Gordon fucking Ramsey* during the period he was supposed to be fasting.

Here&#39;s a short summary and plug:

**The rules**

Mahjong is a distant cousin of Rummy and plays similarly. You build sequences or sets of 3 tiles (e.g. 2-3-4 or 2-2-2) of the same suit. Discarded tiles can be claimed by other players. Four of those sets/sequences plus a pair make up a winning hand. The more rare qualities (e.g. having a flush, having a straight from 1 to 9) your hand has, the more valuable it is.

Reasonable people might stop here, but it&#39;s Japanese Mahjong, so we need at least four more rules:

Firstly, you need at least one of those rare qualities (called yaku) in your hand for it to be considered a winning hand. So no calling random trash for a quick win.

Also, I think somewhere around this week or two marks the point when I started to think about my creative project seriously. 
 I&#39;m yet to define what I want precisely, but I already have a skeleton and I just keep effortlessly coming up with details, approaches, ideas to explore.

It&#39;s worth covering where it all comes from. I had a habit of daydreaming for my entire life. At first it was primitive, obviously derivative of whatever fiction impressed me most at the time, with me as a self-insert - basically me fantasizing about being badass action hero, soldier, mage, genius, and so on.
