They hope the party will become a viable alternative to the Republican and Democratic parties that dominate U.S. politics, founding members told Reuters.

Alcohol has a significant *retrograde* enhancement on memory; it especially enhances positive-valence memory and (perhaps) social/language memory, but only post-learning.  I don’t think the mechanism is conclusive but the hypothesis is that it works by reducing memory interference on information presented post-ingestion. There is no benefit to drinking *before* learning on memory acquisition, there is only a benefit *after* learning on memory *consolidation*. Drinking before any learning will negatively influence acquisition and retention. Or so studies suggest.

There is a technique that old SysAdmins will recognize called tarpitting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpit_(networking)#SMTP_tarpits

The technique is to prevent spammers from being able to abuse a mail server (send too many messages) by simply wasting their time.  If the mail system detects something it believes is a spammer, it will simply make everything take a really long (relatively) time.

Instead of being able to send 1000 messages/second, it might limit you to one message ever 5 seconds (this is exaggerated).  The idea is that a normal user won&#39;t notice this, but a spammer trying to send thousands of messages will.

One of the sub-questions I was curious about was why oil companies weren’t investing more in digging new wells.  A few commenters replied that this was probably because of Biden – he opened up his term by cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline, removing permits on drilling on federal lands and saying we should move towards fully green energy.

It is a brilliant record; I think it&#39;s one of the crowning jewels of the genre both musically and in lyrical poetry.

It&#39;s a concept album, tracing the journey of the energy of a photon of light. Each song is its own self-contained story, starting with the entrance of this bit of energy into a life and ending with the extinguishing of that life&#39;s light and the energy&#39;s departure. It starts in the fusion forges of the sun, in [An Ember&#39;s Arc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyuDOVm8TG4):

This was partly designed as a bonding experience with my dad and partly because it feels to me like the liberation of France is arguably Western democracy’s finest hour.

I almost skipped it, but I’m glad I stopped at the [cemetery at Omaha beach ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_American_Cemetery_and_Memorial). The grounds are beautiful, and I found the experience of seeing the graves of so many young men surprisingly moving....</a></blockquote></div></div></div><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-sm text-gray-400">Generated on <span title="2022-07-28 02:20:30.619312263 UTC">Jul 28, 02:20 UTC</span></div></div><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-sm text-gray-500"><p>Powered by <a class="font-semibold" href="https://ema.srid.ca">Ema</a> | <a href="https://github.com/EmaApps/TheMotteDashboard">Source &amp; Feedback</a></p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
