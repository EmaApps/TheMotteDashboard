Men, for instance, can be raised to value the Spartan way of life, the Athenian way of life, or the Puritan way of life. By simply changing some variables we can have people value different things.

Lived experience is the idea that for example a black person’s experience trumps any data a white person collects because living as a black person provides more info compared to any data a white person could analyze. 

But a person “born” a male who appears a male and lives life as a male cannot have any experience as a woman; that is, just like the white person can’t really know what it’s like to be a black person a male cant really know what it is like or means to be a female. 

So how can the male know he is a female if he can’t understand what a female is due to a lack of lived experience?...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-red-50" title="Culture War"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igd5kzu/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-16 06:33:10 UTC">Jul 16, 06:33 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Lizzardspawn">u/Lizzardspawn</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igd5kzu/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">In abortion debate I see that number of elective abortions that a woman could ha</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igd5kzu/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">ve during her lifetime is somehow left out of the discourse.

Match number 1 was a thin blonde who opened with “How are you doing handsome?” Yellow flag. That is not something that women say to me, especially not as an opening. I’m not grotesque or repulsive(I don’t think), but I’m certainly not “handsome”, otherwise I wouldn’t be a mid 20s kv.

1: Female subject with small daughter in tow attempts to purchase a number of items at a bodega, but her EBT card is declined. The clerk (M/61)runs the card a couple times, then declines the sale. When he gathers the items, the woman begins shouting that he assaulted her daughter, that he &quot;snatched&quot; a bag of chips from her etc. Unclear from video angle.

Almost all of our friends moved away from our city during or after COVID.  

My wife and I traveled for a friend&#39;s engagement party (one of those friends who moved away)--it was fine.  The day after, we met up with an old friend of mine and an old college friend of hers who live there, and we had a much better time with them than we&#39;ve had with any of our friends at home in a really long time.  

... I&#39;m finding myself feeling a little sad after that for two reasons:

Hence, polemics

I am always surprised by the rhetoric used in these cases, because the main defence from the progressives left is &quot;why we should care about this when we have the economy to care about?&quot;

Mind you, this tactic of &quot;but the economy?&quot; is probably the most used ever by every political side in history, but my point is another:

I think people inherently don&#39;t like being told what to do. When someone compels you to do something, chances are it benefits them more than it benefits you, so we have an automatic reflex to assume that we&#39;re being shortchanged.

The weird thing is, when you look around at modern society, there&#39;s no one entity that really tells you what to do. If you don&#39;t like your job, you can quit at any time and no one will make you keep working. But then, if you don&#39;t have any job, you&#39;ll probably have to live on the street and that&#39;s not pleasant, so if you want to live a normal life...</a></blockquote></div></div></div><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-sm text-gray-400">Generated on <span title="2022-07-18 02:22:08.749697272 UTC">Jul 18, 02:22 UTC</span></div></div><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-sm text-gray-500"><p>Powered by <a class="font-semibold" href="https://ema.srid.ca">Ema</a> | <a href="https://github.com/EmaApps/TheMotteDashboard">Source &amp; Feedback</a></p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
