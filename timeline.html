I think finally we may be seeing our fist notable, multinational woke undoing. It&#39;s too early to blame wokness for sure, but Disney stock has been doing horribly lately, way worse than the S&amp;amp;P 500. 

Disney is at $95, a 53% decline from its peak just 16 months ago, versus a 20% decline for the S&amp;amp;P 500. Moreover, Disney stock is unchanged since early 2015, lagging the S&amp;amp;P 500 considerably there too. 

This difference is huge:  over the past 5 years the S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 56% (excluding dividends) but Disney is down 11%

The idea is that the left is just pushing *too far* and if leftists had been a bit more charitable or a bit more reasonable, then rightists would have been happy to compromise. Explicit or implicit is a historical fantasy where the right was sitting passively until the left showed up and tried to implement some change, which the right happily (or at least agreeably) permitted.

I fasted Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and most of Saturday. 

Unfortunately, I had a drinking lapse. Either Thursday or Friday I justified to myself, in usual alcoholic fashion, to drink “just one last time.” The plan was to grab a “mickey” of rum (contains 8 standard drinks) for my last eating day of the week (Sunday) and factor that into total calories. I grabbed it on Saturday since liquor stores open late on Sundays which would prevent me from beginning to drink right away on the Sunday (yes, I know). Couldn’t resist the urge to have a few drinks that same day and ended up drinking the whole thing.

I did indeed start swiping on other guys on Tinder. I somehow got four matches in a couple days, and two of them didn&#39;t even ghost me immediately! We switched to Snapchat texts and everything.

...which was *absolutely exhausting*. I don&#39;t understand how people chat over text with near-strangers they&#39;re trying to possibly date. The notification sound now produces not so much butterflies as the panic response.

I applied for a a job that was exactly what I was looking for. I had the exact tech stack they were looking for as well. Pay was good too (60k no tax, without bonus, not the US so this is a good pay). 

However, as a part of the interview process, I got handed an &quot;aptitude test&quot;, which was a blatant IQ test. I have never done a real IQ test, but my scores are mensa.no (130), mensa.dk (135). Now I don&#39;t put in too much weight into those numbers but I don&#39;t think I am stupid. My IQ is probably around 120 if we go by proxies of IQ. 

I failed their IQ test hard. They didn&#39;t give me a percentile, but I got 61/100. Mind you this test was a lot harder than standard IQ tests.

Match number 1 was a thin blonde who opened with “How are you doing handsome?” Yellow flag. That is not something that women say to me, especially not as an opening.

My wife and I traveled for a friend&#39;s engagement party (one of those friends who moved away)--it was fine.
