In 1997 a little game came out called “Final Fantasy 7.” You may have heard of it. The game is wildly influential, often considered one of the best games of all time…and has aged like moderately fine vinegar. If you weren’t active in gaming at the time it’s hard to overstate the influence of the game. It was fantastic, for many people it changed what they thought games were capable of, and one of the spoilers was for decades afterwards (although less so now) was often uttered along with “Vader, father” as one of the top spoilers of all time.

There is a technique that old SysAdmins will recognize called tarpitting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpit_(networking)#SMTP_tarpits

The technique is to prevent spammers from being able to abuse a mail server (send too many messages) by simply wasting their time.  If the mail system detects something it believes is a spammer, it will simply make everything take a really long (relatively) time.

Instead of being able to send 1000 messages/second, it might limit you to one message ever 5 seconds (this is exaggerated).  The idea is that a normal user won&#39;t notice this, but a spammer trying to send thousands of messages will.

Lynching.  I&#39;m trying to understand the extent and severity.  Is there a good resource for understanding the historical phenomenon as it occurred in the United States?  Hopefully with some high level of detail and specificity?  I am of the impression that it&#39;s incredibly inflated in the minds of modern individuals - occurring a few thousand times over the course of a century, to people of various ethnicities.

Now, even after uninstalling iTunes (and its associated tools) and a day later reinstalling my Intel onboard graphics driver, the problems remain.

It would seem to fall in line with other kinds of “fasting” that have health benefits (caloric fasting, sleep restriction to increase sleep efficiency).
