Why does the Left hate Ronald Reagan so damn much?

Or, more specifically, what did Reagan do, exactly, to earn so much opprobrium from progressives?

I see it all the time online, people who are on the left/progressive side of politics casually dropping a &quot;Reagan started the destruction of the American middle class&quot; into a conversation with no explanation or context.

I was was born in the late 70&#39;s so I don&#39;t have any memory of what times were like before the Reagan Era.

The argument about the glass shard strikes me as very odd. Of course it makes a difference if the child comes 5 days hence or a millennia. Within a few years we can probably expect the shard to be buried and rendered harmless. Within a century we can assign a reasonably high probability that the forest track has changed route due to natural subsidences etc. Within a millennia, who knows if any hu...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-gray-50" title="Small-Scale Question"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im5ub2m/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-28 19:01:15 UTC">Aug 28, 19:01 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/EdenicFaithful">u/EdenicFaithful</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im5ub2m/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">So, what are you reading?

This dataset received an update last week and has since created a lot of buzz in the vaccine-skeptic/anti-vaxx circles on reddit, Substack and Twitter, while receiving comparatively little airtime on more mainstream publications in relation to the (perceived) importance of the phenomenon. The basic finding is that elevated mortality has continued into 2022 and is currently on track to surpass both 2020 and 2021. This is particularly surprising given that we&#39;d expect a decrease in mortality now that a whole lot of vulnerable people have died already.

Magnus is the most interesting case study of performance psychology because he’s so beyond his competition, in what amounts to the most competitive cognitive game in the world. 

Some interesting bits from the interview:

* Magnus does not like practicing with puzzles. Neither does he consider himself good at stand-alone puzzles. 

* Magnus hates strict, organized practice. He refused to do this as a child and instead enjoyed exploring interesting parts from books he takes a liking to. When he was younger he “fired” Kasparov as a coach (one of the best players of all time) because Kasparov wanted Magnus to ana...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-purple-50" title="Friday Fun"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im0xsgc/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-27 17:25:46 UTC">Aug 27, 17:25 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/DuplexFields">u/DuplexFields</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im0xsgc/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">For the Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality fans here on The Motte, here</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im0xsgc/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">&#39;s [Daniel Radcliffe singing an appropriately scientific song](https://youtu.be/rSAaiYKF0cs?t=32)....</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-purple-50" title="Friday Fun"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilzle2b/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-27 11:00:56 UTC">Aug 27, 11:00 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Difficult_Ad_3879">u/Difficult_Ad_3879</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilzle2b/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">I’ve noticed from social media that  skinny guys with low body fat get more fema</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilzle2b/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">le attention than those who have a gym body.

While I was there, I overhead a not-really private discussion between the nurses about the [removal of 377A](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-62545577).
