The resulting investigation, hearings, and appeals eventually generated nearly 5000 pages of documents, or enough to fill about two banker&#39;s boxes.

Nothing I reviewed indicates whether or not JFK ever personally looked into the matter. May we all be so dedicated to the causes we hold dear.

* The stimulus that signals the end of a punishment, or is even *more toward the end* of a punishment, takes on positive valence in flies, mice, and (debated) humans. Not just *within the context of punishment*, but outside the context too. If you zap a mouse for a couple minutes and toward the end of the zap you play a certain sound, the mouse will “like” this sound and approach it outside the context. This is a kind of relief learning, where we begin to desire things that are associated with relief.

Refresher:

*Q: What is the point?*

Lower inhibition, lower effort conversations. While civility and order is maintained,  most of TheMotte rules do not apply. Why? Well, we do already have a place where they apply. Motte rules produce good discussions, but also constrain, so I thought there is value in  experimenting with something a little different. Chat format is a good fit for that - it has different architecture and features compared to a forum like this one.

Per the details on my YouTube page, in Part 1 we touch on the deracinated dating pov of the isolated, profilicity (ala philosopher Hans-Georg Moeller), AWALT (&quot;All Women Are Like That&quot;), MGTOW, the all-that-matters-are-looks blackpilled MRAs, and hilarious old school pickup artist &quot;Mystery.&quot;

In Part 2 we discuss the racial composition of incels; &quot;Just Be White&quot;; the relationship between income, job type and infidelity; and the impact of remote work and pandemic on singles vs. marrieds.
