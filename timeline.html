&amp;gt;The men who engage in sexual assault are not, as the narrative goes, hapless victims of changing sexual mores. They are, at worst, pretending they don’t know that what they are doing is wrong; or, what is almost as bad, they are utterly clueless: they are unable or unwilling to listen to women because their own sense of entitlement drowns out everything else.

The concept of &quot;entitlement&quot; is frequently used in feminist discourse to explain male sexual behavior, particularly in cases of rape and sexual assault.

* Indian history, esp Partition. Thats a big blank spot on my history knowledge
* Economic history is fun. I always enjoy hearing about the behind the scenes factors that led to our modern world.

I usually prefer larger scope to smaller, though there have been notable exceptions.

For most of my adult life, I wasn&#39;t really interested in romance, relationships, or women in general. This has recently changed. I&#39;ve grown increasingly interested about the idea of falling in love and marrying someone. There are a number of reasons for this. Lately, more and more frequently I&#39;ve been feeling unhappy about being alone and lacking connections, and I like the idea of someone genuinely feeling attracted to me. I sometimes feel like my current life is pointless overall; creating a family and fathering children feels like a good way of making myself feel that I&#39;ve amounted to something. And, to be honest, I want to actually share my sexuality with another livin...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-gray-50" title="Small-Scale Question"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ieo612g/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-03 06:54:57 UTC">Jul 03, 06:54 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/slider5876">u/slider5876</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ieo612g/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Took a flight yesterday.

Serving meals on flights makes absolutely no sense, but at the same time I kind of miss it.  It had to be expensive to serve meals on flights because it’s literally added weight and taking up expensive space.  No one on the ground would pay the price I think it costs.  My guess is $20-30 a meal.  They are sort of like MRE for the military.  Very specific portion sizes.  Supposedly the portion size that a person is suppose to eat; which is smaller than what eat but then you had more courses than I eat.

From nostalgia perspective the food was different than what you would buy on the ground.  It was optimized to taste ok in the air.
