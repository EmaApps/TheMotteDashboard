As a woman from a south american country who migrated to a Nordic country, I had expectations about what it would be like to live in a more progressive society when it comes to gender roles. Nordic countries are well known for their advances in gender equality, with men and women playing very similar roles in parenting, the work environment, politics, and so on.

And I was not disappointed. To my experience, this is true.

1.  Does anyone pay the $25-50 to get a more forward seat on a plane?  I was on a plane with no middle seat - 2 seats on each sides.  I can understand paying for not middle seat but whose shelling out cash for the same seat 10-15 rows closer to front.

1. Sharing personal stories. This writing will mostly be used to speak with friends and family. Possibly as a diary. Possibly as a dream journal (I have lots of weird dreams, and I think I should start mining some of them for story ideas).
2. Writing fictional stories. I use to write a story in the past. I maybe burned out, or just lost my passion. But at the time I didn&#39;t feel very skilled at it, I&#39;d like to be better if the passion ever takes me again.

Not sure if I&#39;m interested enough, but he was a pioneer in cognitive therapies. So far he seems to have added a layer on top of behavioural conditioning, where the words that people use to &quot;self-indoctrinate&quot; themselves function as a reward/punishment mechanism. So even if you use Freudian analysis to reveal the roots of someone&#39;s problems, you still have to deal with the mechanism by which those problems are reinforced. He argues that these self-indoctrinating words often hide irrational premises, which, when noticed and challenged, leads to improvement.

* The stimulus that signals the end of a punishment, or is even *more toward the end* of a punishment, takes on positive valence in flies, mice, and (debated) humans.

If you zap a mouse for a couple minutes and toward the end of the zap you play a certain sound, the mouse will “like” this sound and approach it outside the context. This is a kind of relief learning, where we begin to desire things that are associated with relief.

(The background for this is I&#39;m looking to move in the next year and buy a house to raise my kids in.  I am not tied to any location for work; I care mostly about the education and the culture and the peers my kids will interact with.  When comparing schools and districts, there are lots of dimensions to compare, but most are subjective, difficult to measure, or difficult to compare across states.  SAT scores are cold hard facts that correlate to a lot of things I care about, but they&#39;re hard to find.
