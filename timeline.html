What party do you think John is in?  There is actually a reference, but it&#39;s quick.  I missed it when I saw it live.

I feel like there&#39;s a lot to unpack here.  Fetterman is going to fight Washington?  Where his party has the White House, the House and the Senate???  Because people feel forgotten, like their best time was a generation ago?  A decade of left-leaning media has taught me that that&#39;s a blatant racist dog-whistle, appealing to aggrieved white entitlement.  Maybe it&#39;s just smart, faux-flag campaigning in a red wave year with a very unpopular president.

Why the pay gap? Perhaps it&#39;s because of systemic sexism. Perhaps it&#39;s because no one watches WNBA games and the NBA subsidizes it to the tune of $10M/year. But I&#39;m less interested in understanding that than why WNBA players can move to Russia in the off season to make millions.

3. You can become God like. By the end of it I want my cumulative game skill and upgrades to make the game stupidly easy. Slaughtering foes without a thought, and only the hardest of bosses presenting the slightest challenge.

I can find plenty of games with the first two elements.

It’s popular enough that this kind of gets taken for granted, but the premise is really clever.
On one hand, there’s the distillation of an RPG into each game: do tasks, numbers go up, steer the character to a style you want. There’s a balance between fundamental gameplay loops to improve and broader game *knowledge* to accrue. On the other is the pure PvP aspect using humans as a seed to keep things fresh.

But what really gets me is the specialization. I like a game which gives a specific job, a part of the machine. You get to play to strengths and watch the whole thing come together. And *League* does this...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-purple-50" title="Friday Fun"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii60d0o/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-29 19:24:51 UTC">Jul 29, 19:24 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/SeeeVeee">u/SeeeVeee</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii60d0o/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Does anybody have a link to Yarvin&#39;s essay that covers why he thinks modern poet</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii60d0o/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">ry sucks?...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-purple-50" title="Friday Fun"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii5ks9g/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-29 17:41:43 UTC">Jul 29, 17:41 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/eBenTrovato">u/eBenTrovato</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii5ks9g/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">What are your go-to hotel chains, where you always feel like you get good servic</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii5ks9g/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">e, a clean room, and your full money’s worth? i.e., what’s the Chick-Fil-A of hotels?...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-purple-50" title="Friday Fun"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii5i4vr/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-29 17:24:38 UTC">Jul 29, 17:24 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/DWXXV">u/DWXXV</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii5i4vr/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Ready for a deep dive into something completely random?

In 1997 a little game came out called “Final Fantasy 7.” You may have heard of it. The game is wildly influential, often considered one of the best games of all time…and has aged like moderately fine vinegar. If you weren’t active in gaming at the time it’s hard to overstate the influence of the game. It was fantastic, for many people it changed what they thought games were capable of, and one of the spoilers was for decades afterwards (although less so now) was often uttered along with “Vader, father” as one of the top spoilers of all time.
