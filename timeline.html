Week 4/60 is behind me. Easily the most difficult week. A lot of fatigue, cravings, low mood, etc. Still feeling that right now even though I would have been overjoyed to be in this position at my fattest.  

As I had planned, I fasted the first two days of the week and then final four days as well with Wednesday off. Feeling very lethargic but fortunately I am all done with trying to lose fat. Going to bed hungry tonight but I get to eat tomorrow. No alcohol and I finished the last pack in my carton of cigarettes yesterday. Won&#39;t be buying more.

It’s the enforced culture of speaking plainly.

A friend has asked me today: what&#39;s the deal with Dugin’s Noomahia? Isn&#39;t it just a bunch of evocative chapter titles pointing at literal emptiness hidden under the shallow plaiting of made-up words?  

It&#39;s probably not. Unwieldy and meandering though it is, it remains clearly more interpretable to me than the sort of pseudo-profound Lakanian bullshit Alan Sokal has revealed in his book; and it&#39;s interpretable in the specific way intended by the author.

Apparently rich people are using private planes for short flights, and it&#39;s an ecological disaster.

This story has been making the rounds for the past 4 days. It started as an article on Mel and then blew up and has been trending on twitter and all over the web. 

I am somewhat skeptical of the narrative that&#39;s it&#39;s that bad for the environment. Yes, it may be wasteful, but the number of people who fly private for short distances is minuscule compared to other sources of emissions and compared to commercial travel.

For some reason, my thought here was that this is simultaneously very empty and very full. It&#39;s full of *things*, but not *people*.

Have started running again with a friend (who has serious problems controlling his weight). I tend to get awful soreness/tightness in my shins, but seems to be getting less bad. Another friend has returned to the gym with me too, which is nice, except that it&#39;s because he broke up with his girlfriend, so it feels a little bit wrong to take pleasure from a bad event like that....</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-red-50" title="Culture War"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1d1vb/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-21 11:35:25 UTC">Jul 21, 11:35 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Tophattingson">u/Tophattingson</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1d1vb/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Came across a novel (at least for me) use of AI text generation, via a youtube c</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1d1vb/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">hannel that usually isn&#39;t on that subject.

TL;DR: We need to stop using extremist language and start defining our terms.

From u/buttfaceszn:

&amp;gt;I’ve noticed that the term incel has begun to be used as more of a catchall pejorative for sexism of any kind (at least on the internet) which strikes me as odd.

Vaping was always dumb, I don’t even want that in my life. But I can’t resist it when I’m drunk, and I’m always around it, so I ended up just doing it by default.

Alcohol is mostly just nice because it’s weird to not drink, at least in my friend group. So it’s just avoiding that whole awkwardness.

This bill basically sets out a list of reasons why abortions may not be restricted and creates a test for what future reasons will be prohibited by the law. It targets pretty directly laws various Republican states passed when *Roe* was still in effect to limit abortion. It empowers both the US Attorney General and private parties (including those seeking abortions and those providing them) to sue to enforce the law.
