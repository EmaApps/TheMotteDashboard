I&#39;m watching an anime called Silver Spoon, which I have a lot of things to say about but this isn&#39;t really one of them.

For some reason, my thought here was that this is simultaneously very empty and very full. It&#39;s full of *things*, but not *people*. This is, from what I understand, just what farms look like; they are very equipment-heavy, and so you&#39;ll have massive enormous farms, filled with giant silos and buildings and massive machines, but with surprisingly few *people* work...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-red-50" title="Culture War"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih9i22f/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-23 00:43:51 UTC">Jul 23, 00:43 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Atherzon">u/Atherzon</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih9i22f/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">There is a lot of discussion of the the Russian invasion of Ukraine in a top lev</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih9i22f/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">el thread from a couple of days ago with lots of claims of who thought what and when with only one real objectively verifiable claim referenced (that Russia would control more territory after a certain one month period), so I would like to give everyone an opportunity to make some falsifiable predictions with a percentage of certainty and a date and means to determine if the prediction was accurate.

Another friend has returned to the gym with me too, which is nice, except that it&#39;s because he broke up with his girlfriend, so it feels a little bit wrong to take pleasure from a bad event like that....</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-red-50" title="Culture War"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1d1vb/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-21 11:35:25 UTC">Jul 21, 11:35 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Tophattingson">u/Tophattingson</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1d1vb/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Came across a novel (at least for me) use of AI text generation, via a youtube c</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1d1vb/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">hannel that usually isn&#39;t on that subject.

Vaping was always dumb, I don’t even want that in my life. But I can’t resist it when I’m drunk, and I’m always around it, so I ended up just doing it by default.

Alcohol is mostly just nice because it’s weird to not drink, at least in my friend group. So it’s just avoiding that whole awkwardness.

This bill basically sets out a list of reasons why abortions may not be restricted and creates a test for what future reasons will be prohibited by the law. It targets pretty directly laws various Republican states passed when *Roe* was still in effect to limit abortion. It empowers both the US Attorney General and private parties (including those seeking abortions and those providing them) to sue to enforce the law.

Humans are this malleable, that they can be raised to value particular things according to what they consume and how they model rewards. Men, for instance, can be raised to value the Spartan way of life, the Athenian way of life, or the Puritan way of life. By simply changing some variables we can have people value different things.

This is important, because it means we can just think dispassionately “what is best for the whole of society”, without much care for what people happen to value at this particular point, ourselves included.
