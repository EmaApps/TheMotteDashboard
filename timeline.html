We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically there&#39;s about to be some kind of dump that&#39;s similar to that.

But it&#39;s been 6 months and support seems as strong as ever, at least judging by the recent 3bn military transfer along with the number of blue-and-yellow emojis on twitter. For many reasons, I think this war is not only a great chance to beat back Russian expansionism, but also to bring Ukraine closer to the west, hence why this question is important for me.

So--why do Americans seem so eager to help Ukraine?

My take is that it&#39;s mainly because they&#39;re acting out values that we admire.

The tall white pipe goes to the grey pipe. The U-pipe connects the tall white pipe to the one leading into the wall.

The pieces do assemble in something resembling a pipe, and water gets through them, but the connection is way too loose and water leaks all over the place.

There is this rubber washer where the U-pipe means the straight white pipe and it does not feel like it is seated right.

Is there a trick or a correct order to do these things?

It strikes me from work in the U.S. public sector that the old observation that the government moves slowly to be true. 

Anecdotally, it seems the slowness stems from countless procedures of reviews to ensure legal and policy compliance.

Not sure this is totally culture war, except for the fact that nuclear power itself has been such a wretched target of environmentalist culture warriors that we haven&#39;t bothered to build any nuke plants in the USA in decades.

The article does the math to figure out how much power is generated by uranium and coal, and calculates an equivalent amount of pollutant for honest comparisons. Really pretty simple.

Over the past decade, the political zeitgeist in India has been apparently captured indisputably by Hindu Nationalism in the national capacity, while still struggling in many states. Any strand of liberalism left isn&#39;t really a direction anymore, but pressure from above or outside. The term &#39;South Asia&#39; is not very well liked in India, which is seen by many nationalists as a reductionism of their civilisation to another geographic patch of landm...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-gray-50" title="Small-Scale Question"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilab9wd/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-22 05:16:44 UTC">Aug 22, 05:16 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/urquan5200">u/urquan5200</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilab9wd/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">So, this is going to be a case of &quot;sheltered religious conservative doesn&#39;t unde</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilab9wd/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">rstand slang&quot; but... what is a fuckboy?

My theory is that the writer has a respectable IQ and excellent writing talent, so whenever there&#39;s some real-world basis (however distant) for his thoughts like the science parts, it&#39;s hard not to be sucked in.

As background, I took an AP Comp Sci class in highschool, and then mostly didn&#39;t do programming in undergrad except occasionally messing around on my calculator as I majored in Math.  In grad school, I ended up drifting more in the direction of game theory, and started doing mathematical modeling, which gradually become more and more of my emphasis until now as a postdoc that&#39;s pretty much all that I do.
