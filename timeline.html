I’ve tried to quit numerous times but I think this is the actual time. I’m just tired of feeling like dog shit most of the time. I’m tired and haven’t been exercising like I used to.

Vaping was always dumb, I don’t even want that in my life. But I can’t resist it when I’m drunk, and I’m always around it, so I ended up just doing it by default.

Alcohol is mostly just nice because it’s weird to not drink, at least in my friend group. So it’s just avoiding that whole awkwardness. But, it does seem like it’s getting more common to encounter people who don’t drink. Maybe that’s just because I’m getting older.

The first is the [Women&#39;s Health Protection Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3755/text). This bill basically sets out a list of reasons why abortions may not be restricted and creates a test for what future reasons will be prohibited by the law. It targets pretty directly laws various Republican states passed when *Roe* was still in effect to limit abortion. It empowers both the US Attorney General and private parties (including those seeking abortions and those providing them) to sue to enforce the law.

The second of these is the [Ensuring Women’s Right to Reproductive Freedom Act](htt...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-green-50" title="Wellness Wednesday"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/igym84d/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-20 20:15:20 UTC">Jul 20, 20:15 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/wmil">u/wmil</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-green-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/igym84d/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Any advice for joint issues?

I will try to defend my case on why I think my position of being a skeptic should have been the default position. And the fact it wasn&#39;t requires some heavy investigation as to why.

I don’t really like when people use the term incel as an insult to people who bring up redpill/PUA/manosphere-type things, since I suspect there’s a lot of non-incels who find these things interesting and I personally think some of it has value. But from the perspective of someone who is trying to insult a redpill/MRA type in a heated Reddit argument, it at least makes sense to call them an incel. Incels afaik do really tend to be into these ideas, and people who excessively harp on them can come across as resentful about their own personal struggles with women.

I think finally we may be seeing our fist notable, multinational woke undoing. It&#39;s too early to blame wokness for sure, but Disney stock has been doing horribly lately, way worse than the S&amp;amp;P 500. 

Disney is at $95, a 53% decline from its peak just 16 months ago, versus a 20% decline for the S&amp;amp;P 500. Moreover, Disney stock is unchanged since early 2015, lagging the S&amp;amp;P 500 considerably there too. 

This difference is huge:  over the past 5 years the S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 56% (excluding dividends) but Disney is down 11%

Humans are this malleable, that they can be raised to value particular things according to what they consume and how they model rewards. Men, for instance, can be raised to value the Spartan way of life, the Athenian way of life, or the Puritan way of life. By simply changing some variables we can have people value different things.

This is important, because it means we can just think dispassionately “what is best for the whole of society”, without much care for what people happen to value at this particular point, ourselves included.
