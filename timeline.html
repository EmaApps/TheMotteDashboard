I came across a [news story](https://www.khou.com/article/news/crime/tomball-is</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v0trau/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_may_30_2022/ib5guzz/" class="text-gray-500">d-family-killed-in-centerville-texas/285-ad1274ed-db15-4c2e-b2d0-54948156479c) that made me more upset than usual. An escaped convict, a cartel member, murdered five members of a family in Texas. Reasoning why this story hit me hard, I concluded that the crime I find significant is not the crime that is measured in graphs and figures. I think we’re measuring crime incorrectly and should be fighting crime differently. 

In terms of the betterment of society, a criminal killing a well-adjusted citizen is worse than a criminal killing another criminal. Much crime in America is criminal-on-criminal. This should be modified a bit, because criminality is a spectrum, not a matter of violating the l...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-purple-50" title="Friday Fun"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v3s27m/friday_fun_thread_for_june_03_2022/ib52hlw/"><span title="2022-06-04 12:28:56 UTC">Jun 04, 12:28 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Im_not_JB">u/Im_not_JB</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v3s27m/friday_fun_thread_for_june_03_2022/ib52hlw/" class="extlink">How do y&#39;all browse reddit on mobile?

This evening I sent out invites to my birthday party to a bunch of friends. One of my friends (the wife of a barrister pal) asked me if we were enjoying the jubilee. I commented that my wife (from the Philippines) had eaten a bunch of scones already, to which my friend&#39;s wife replied &quot;oh, she&#39;s gone native!&quot;

At this point, my cheeks flushed a little. Why? After all, this was a wholly innocuous comment, and was in no way indicative of any colonialist feelings on the part of my friend&#39;s wife. It was entirely a matter of using a figure of speech in its appropriate context.

It is a vampire survival game. You build forts, hunt down people for their blood, fight bosses, and unlock gear to improve your character.

I&#39;ve had a decent amount of fun, but I&#39;ve also been at war with the game&#39;s expected way of playing. 

V Rising is meant to be a multiplayer game. All of the default game and difficulty settings are meant for multiplayer. A boss that might be fodder in front of three players is nearly impossible alone. There are also built in time and resource sinks, which require quite a bit of grinding. Some of those time and resource sinks are shared sinks.

Due to some combination of COVID restrictions around filming and the self-professed burnout/fatigue of its creators, the last two seasons of *Inside No. 9* have taken on a less whimsical, more indecipherable, and far more referential air than the preceding five (clearly paying homage to events or storylines from real life/other series as the creators grasp for ideas).

The fast repetition and multi-sensory (auditory/visual) focus makes these reward/punishment states very salient, so the mind can strongly distinguish between the two, growing the desire for the reward and dislike of the punishment.

A young christian woman was lynched by muslim students at the college she went to, supposedly right before she was about to be taken into police protection. There are conflicting reports on what she was killed for, but it seems to be a social media post of some kind. In response, the Nigerian government has declared that the college she attended will be closed.

According to this article there are dozens of lawyers rushing to defend the men accused of murdering her.

At the center of the shooting, like others before it, was a false conviction that an international Jewish conspiracy intends to supplant white voters with immigrants who will gradually take over political power in America.

The conspiracy, known as the “great replacement theory,” has roots reaching back at least to the czarist Russian antisemitic hoax called “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” which purported to be a Jewish plot to overtake Christianity in Europe.

I think so because those on the economic left give greater weight to suffering under economic destitution than negative utility experienced by having to give away large chunks of your income, and that seems to be a well defended motte to be in, its hard to argue for the inverse. 

A truly capitalistic system would also entail tremendous short term suffering for some classes of people, for the &quot;losers&quot;.

I’ve lived in both the United States and Europe, and  I’ve spent a decent amount of time in each place we’ve experienced - meaning a month or more, beyond just living as a tourist for a week.
