The most interesting phenomenon to me is that counting and reading in dreams is impossible.

My live-in girlfriend of one year recently told me that while she loves me, she isn&#39;t &#39;in love&#39; with me. Apparently these things are quite different for her.

Essentially, while she has loved all of her previous boyfriends, there was only one that she was &#39;in love&#39; with, who was from several years ago and not the one before me.

She told me it might take time for her to feel &#39;in love&#39;, but that if she doesn&#39;t feel it, she&#39;ll break up with me. Her parents had a nasty divorce so she&#39;s paranoid about settling down with someone who isn&#39;t her &#39;soulmate&#39;. (Not her exact words, but that was the gist of it).

Overall I feel pretty hurt by this. Saying we loved eachother seemed like a big deal to ...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-red-50" title="Culture War"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/immjz1o/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-09-01 06:00:20 UTC">Sep 01, 06:00 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/AlternativeEvent2584">u/AlternativeEvent2584</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/immjz1o/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">If we had the technology to actually change genders where you couldn&#39;t tell the </a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/immjz1o/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">difference between a woman/man born the wrong gender and an actual person born of that gender would you support it?

An airplane&#39;s wings are for flying - the intentions of engineers ensure that. But birds had no creator, no agent involved in their existence. We might be able to metaphorically talk about a bird being &quot;designed&quot; or &quot;built&quot; for flight, but it is only that: a metaphor.

If we want to limit our description to what can be described based on an physico-empirical view of reality, then a bird&#39;s wing&#39;s **make flight possible** or **allow them to fly**, but we can&#39;t speak about a bird&#39;s wings being &quot;for&quot; anything at all.

- No tracking of start date, only due date. Any task with a date configured is assumed to be a discrete amount of work to be done on the day that it is due, or shortly before.
- There is no concept of prioritization within a time window. I can&#39;t ask &quot;what is the most urgent task that I need to get done within two weeks?&quot; 
- If I have a daily recurring task and I mark it as done for yesterday, then the next occurence is tomorrow. There is no concept of catching up on overdue engagements.

So, I&#39;ve got a burning question about the whole &quot;Money corrupts politics?&quot; debate. It seems like whenever someone says it does, the response is to point to studies looking at whether it can change who the person in power. These studies point to the answer being no.

My question, then, is whether anyone has looked at this from the perspective of a politician?

1. Politicians want to have more votes and more money to run their campaigns. Having someone drop out of supporting you is something they should be sensitive to. Politicians may weigh their incentives and goals if two or more contradict, but I don&#39;t think any politician declares a level of support beyond which they will not allow ...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-gray-50" title="Small-Scale Question"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/ime67pd/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-30 14:54:05 UTC">Aug 30, 14:54 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Primaprimaprima">u/Primaprimaprima</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/ime67pd/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">What problems do you think are AGI-complete?</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/ime67pd/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-gray-50" title="Small-Scale Question"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/imdah89/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-30 10:22:40 UTC">Aug 30, 10:22 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/zfinder">u/zfinder</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/imdah89/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Does anyone have a good theory about why antivaxxers are anti**vaxxers**, specif</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/imdah89/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">ically?


People are ready to build statistical models, recheck scientific PDFs, run monothematic blogs with long texts filled with apocalyptic vocabulary, quarrel with friends.

Why does the Left hate Ronald Reagan so damn much?

Or, more specifically, what did Reagan do, exactly, to earn so much opprobrium from progressives?

I see it all the time online, people who are on the left/progressive side of politics casually dropping a &quot;Reagan started the destruction of the American middle class&quot; into a conversation with no explanation or context.

I was was born in the late 70&#39;s so I don&#39;t have any memory of what times were like before the Reagan Era.

The argument about the glass shard strikes me as very odd. Of course it makes a difference if the child comes 5 days hence or a millennia.

The basic finding is that elevated mortality has continued into 2022 and is currently on track to surpass both 2020 and 2021.
