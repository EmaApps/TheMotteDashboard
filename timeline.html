Magnus is the most interesting case study of performance psychology because he’s so beyond his competition, in what amounts to the most competitive cognitive game in the world. 

Some interesting bits from the interview:

* Magnus does not like practicing with puzzles. Neither does he consider himself good at stand-alone puzzles. 

* Magnus hates strict, organized practice. He refused to do this as a child and instead enjoyed exploring interesting parts from books he takes a liking to. When he was younger he “fired” Kasparov as a coach (one of the best players of all time) because Kasparov wanted Magnus to ana...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-purple-50" title="Friday Fun"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im0xsgc/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-27 17:25:46 UTC">Aug 27, 17:25 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/DuplexFields">u/DuplexFields</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im0xsgc/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">For the Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality fans here on The Motte, here</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im0xsgc/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">&#39;s [Daniel Radcliffe singing an appropriately scientific song](https://youtu.be/rSAaiYKF0cs?t=32)....</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-purple-50" title="Friday Fun"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilzle2b/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-27 11:00:56 UTC">Aug 27, 11:00 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Difficult_Ad_3879">u/Difficult_Ad_3879</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilzle2b/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">I’ve noticed from social media that  skinny guys with low body fat get more fema</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilzle2b/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">le attention than those who have a gym body.

Basically in all the standard gay stereotypes that we have as a society (or maybe in general? Do those stereotypes hold cross-culturally?). I maintained, as I was taught at the time, that just because someone acts that way, it has no bearing on their sexual orientation. They could be effeminate, but still like women. And as we grew up, guess what? Those boys all came out of the closet as gay, some in high school, some afterward.

Zuckerberg&#39;s exact words are somewhat ambiguous:

&amp;gt;The FBI, I think, basically came to us, some folks on our team and was like &quot;Hey, just so you know, like you should be on high alert. We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically there&#39;s about to be some kind of dump that&#39;s similar to that.

But it&#39;s been 6 months and support seems as strong as ever, at least judging by the recent 3bn military transfer along with the number of blue-and-yellow emojis on twitter. For many reasons, I think this war is not only a great chance to beat back Russian expansionism, but also to bring Ukraine closer to the west, hence why this question is important for me.

So--why do Americans seem so eager to help Ukraine?

My take is that it&#39;s mainly because they&#39;re acting out values that we admire.

The tall white pipe goes to the grey pipe. The U-pipe connects the tall white pipe to the one leading into the wall.

The pieces do assemble in something resembling a pipe, and water gets through them, but the connection is way too loose and water leaks all over the place.

There is this rubber washer where the U-pipe means the straight white pipe and it does not feel like it is seated right.

Is there a trick or a correct order to do these things?

**Are accountability and efficiency for a government organization mutually exclusive? Is there an agency/department (U.S. or non-U.S.) that is regarded as possessing both?**

It strikes me from work in the U.S. public sector that the old observation that the government moves slowly to be true. 

Anecdotally, it seems the slowness stems from countless procedures of reviews to ensure legal and policy compliance.
