The argument about the glass shard strikes me as very odd. Of course it makes a difference if the child comes 5 days hence or a millennia. Within a few years we can probably expect the shard to be buried and rendered harmless.

So minor spoilers for Stranger Things, on the character side.  Not the plot side.  They made Will unambiguously gay in season 4.  I hate it.  I hate everything about it.

I remember when Stranger Things came out, a lot of us 80&#39;s kids loved it.  It felt relatively authentic to our childhoods, especially being a nerd back then.  A group of us loved it so much, we got together for a retro AD&amp;amp;D 2E campaign.

The biking around everywhere.  The relatively undeveloped spread out suburban/rural town.  The total lack of adult supervision.  And of course, being a nerd super into something that utterly consumes your every waking thought.

This essay will be largely familiar to all who read my thoughts on student loans in the culture war thread [two years ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/jv161w/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_november_16/gckh5ca/?context=999). Given the current salience of the issue, I thought I should revisit and expand the essay to account for the actual loan cancellation announcement. Partially excerpted below, with a focus on sections not included in my original post:

So I&#39;m very curious - why do Americans suddenly care about their neighbors?

This dataset received an update last week and has since created a lot of buzz in the vaccine-skeptic/anti-vaxx circles on reddit, Substack and Twitter, while receiving comparatively little airtime on more mainstream publications in relation to the (perceived) importance of the phenomenon. The basic finding is that elevated mortality has continued into 2022 and is currently on track to surpass both 2020 and 2021. This is particularly surprising given that we&#39;d expect a decrease in mortality now that a whole lot of vulnerable people have died already. Also note the sharp increase of mortality for people below the age of 44 and especially below the age of 14.

* Magnus does not like practicing with puzzles. Neither does he consider himself good at stand-alone puzzles. 

* Magnus hates strict, organized practice. He refused to do this as a child and instead enjoyed exploring interesting parts from books he takes a liking to.

Basically in all the standard gay stereotypes that we have as a society (or maybe in general? Do those stereotypes hold cross-culturally?). I maintained, as I was taught at the time, that just because someone acts that way, it has no bearing on their sexual orientation. They could be effeminate, but still like women. And as we grew up, guess what? Those boys all came out of the closet as gay, some in high school, some afterward.

I could see 3 possibilities:

But it&#39;s been 6 months and support seems as strong as ever, at least judging by the recent 3bn military transfer along with the number of blue-and-yellow emojis on twitter. For many reasons, I think this war is not only a great chance to beat back Russian expansionism, but also to bring Ukraine closer to the west, hence why this question is important for me.

So--why do Americans seem so eager to help Ukraine?

And yet that’s been almost entirely forgotten in the years since. Trump’s presidency was a resounding failure on the anti-immigration front, so maybe that’s why. 

But for whatever reason, today immigration has fallen almost completely by the wayside compared to 2016. On both sides.

Given that the idea that the election was stolen is both false and obviously false - which, let us be clear, both of those claims are clearly the case - what are those of us who can observe and accept reality supposed to do about the large portion of the population who can or will not? The ones who either have actually been fooled and genuinely believe The Lie, or else who are simply lying to themselves when they say they think that Trump genuinely won the election?

Which might seem mild, but I normally can&#39;t muster more than apathy for most politicians or bureaucrats. [This article](https://www.aier.org/article/goodbye-anthony-fauci/) captured a bit of what I dislike about him. A career bureaucrat most of his life. His handling of the AIDS crisis was unimpressive, and his handling of covid felt downright criminal.

I do hope there is some kind of come-uppance for this whole thing. Even if the only consequence he suffers is a public shaming, I&#39;d rather have that than just have him quietly get ignored. I doubt any of that will happen.

I think abortion is a similar issue because, like &quot;equality,&quot; people on &quot;both sides of the issue&quot; today share much more common ground than they think, and are thoroughly blinkered as a result. 

The “anti-abortion” side is pretty straightforward, at least ostensibly. “Human life is sacred, fetus is human life, therefore no kill.” 

The “pro-abortion” side cannot dispute the idea that human life qua human life, that is, individual members of the biological species *homo sapiens*, is sacred and inherently worthy protecting.

2) the step up basis for inheriting equities

The vast vast majority of Americans are not private equity managers (and probably don&#39;t know any....) or rich enough to have any inheritance tax levied on them. Yet the interests of the wealthy have bought the ears of our elected officials. The cost seems very very minimal too, maybe just a couple million a year of campaign contributions to a handful of pivotal senators to save tens of billions in taxes over time.

Even though the pundit class all knows about these, my suspicion is that the public doesn&#39;t care because these things seem like too arcane of det...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-red-50" title="Culture War"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ile306e/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-23 00:03:08 UTC">Aug 23, 00:03 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Then_Election_7412">u/Then_Election_7412</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ile306e/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Stable Diffusion was released to [public beta](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ile306e/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">diffusion-public-release) today, complete with weights. In general, it seems comparable to DALLE2, Imagen, and Parti, beating them in some ways and losing to them in others; the most general comment I&#39;d offer is that it seems to do worse with semantic content and better with textures.
