Nordic countries are well known for their advances in gender equality, with men and women playing very similar roles in parenting, the work environment, politics, and so on.

Found a nice band of gravel &amp;amp; sand at 18 ft in one conveniently close to where I need it. If it goes down a good 10 ft I&#39;m probably set.  
I have no experience with solar, and wondered if any of our trad homesteaders had any advice about a solar pump setup for irrigation (although it seems like a lot of those guys stopped posting or left for CWR/DSL?)

Am still working out how much water I really need for for the 3 rainless months, and whether a storage pond or ~1gpm shallow well feeding into a smaller tank uphill would be better....</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-gray-50" title="Small-Scale Question"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijdkhcy/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-07 23:50:56 UTC">Aug 07, 23:50 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/bulksalty">u/bulksalty</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijdkhcy/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Two cooking questions:

Not sure if I&#39;m interested enough, but he was a pioneer in cognitive therapies. So far he seems to have added a layer on top of behavioural conditioning, where the words that people use to &quot;self-indoctrinate&quot; themselves function as a reward/punishment mechanism. So even if you use Freudian analysis to reveal the roots of someone&#39;s problems, you still have to deal with the mechanism by which those problems are reinforced. He argues that these self-indoctrinating words often hide irrational premises, which, when noticed and challenged, leads to improvement.

The US advertising industry alone is worth almost US$300 billion.

I enjoy the physical labor and enforced socialization with customers, but I&#39;m trying to map out a plan for an actual career where I can make money that isn&#39;t just above poverty level and get weekends off.

Broadly, I like physical work and interacting with people, but have a difficult time doing things I find pointless or immoral and can&#39;t tolerate the heat very well. I&#39;d prefer to avoid further education except as a last resort.

* The stimulus that signals the end of a punishment, or is even *more toward the end* of a punishment, takes on positive valence in flies, mice, and (debated) humans.

If you zap a mouse for a couple minutes and toward the end of the zap you play a certain sound, the mouse will “like” this sound and approach it outside the context. This is a kind of relief learning, where we begin to desire things that are associated with relief.

Lower inhibition, lower effort conversations. While civility and order is maintained,  most of TheMotte rules do not apply. Why? Well, we do already have a place where they apply. Motte rules produce good discussions, but also constrain, so I thought there is value in  experimenting with something a little different. Chat format is a good fit for that - it has different architecture and features compared to a forum like this one.
