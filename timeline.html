I&#39;ve been preparing for the British medical licensing exam there for almost a year, which is probably the longest I&#39;ve ever been able to focus on a task, although the bulk of the focused prep was in the past 3 months. And for once, I don&#39;t have that typical ADHD anxiety the night before the test, because I genuinely know I&#39;ve done all I can, I score well above the cutoff in practise tests, and unlike pretty much every exam I&#39;ve ever given, I don&#39;t find myself desperately cramming the night before to make up for not bothering before.

This story has always held my attention, and I must admit to a certain amount of wistful fascination with the entire episode. The story of a nobody who does something extraordinary, even though it meant his death. There&#39;s something glorious about it. Despite the need to avoid glorifying a man stealing an airplane to take it on a joyride, I can&#39;t help but admire him. 

There aren&#39;t many other things I can think of that are simultaneously ill-advised and wonderfully glorious. The one that came to mind, that has a similar feeling to me, is Alex Honnold, the man who freeclimbed El Capitan.

The community was devastated by the deaths and was also devastated by the killer’s identity: a Sunni gentleman who was known to be a bit off his rocker, and seems to have been motivated by his son marrying a Shiite girl.
