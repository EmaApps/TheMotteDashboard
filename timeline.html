This senior of mine shared a cigarette with me and we all discussed our struggles in life with parents who have sky high academic expectations.

Short version: A consumer can buy a 30 TB hard drive off of Alibaba or Walmart&#39;s website (which is a reseller using them as a storefront).

The capacity is fake. Someone wrote hacked firmware so that two flash drives have (each) 512MB of actual storage self-report as 15TB.

I started with Visual Studio Code since it&#39;s crazy flexible.

I&#39;m under the impression 16-bit code is the default with this arrangement.  I found a free linker called ALINK which then links the OBJ files into an EXE.

There are striking resemblances between commonly reported phenomena reported by lucid dreamers and people with above average dream recall and generated images.

The most interesting phenomenon to me is that counting and reading in dreams is impossible. Lucid dreamers use this by counting their fingers or looking at clock as their “reality check” to tell if they are dreaming or not. It seems odd to me that humans can just forget the number of fingers they have. AI generated images have a similar problem with not caring much about discrete units....</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-purple-50" title="Friday Fun"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x3t1mp/friday_fun_thread_for_september_02_2022/imujvwi/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-09-02 21:17:17 UTC">Sep 02, 21:17 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/stolen_brawnze">u/stolen_brawnze</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x3t1mp/friday_fun_thread_for_september_02_2022/imujvwi/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">A game designer has sparked controversy after submitting an image created by an </a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x3t1mp/friday_fun_thread_for_september_02_2022/imujvwi/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">AI text-to-image generator to a state art competition and [taking home first prize.](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/1/23332684/ai-generated-artwork-wins-state-fair-competition-colorado)...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-purple-50" title="Friday Fun"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x3t1mp/friday_fun_thread_for_september_02_2022/imtqbwo/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-09-02 17:57:26 UTC">Sep 02, 17:57 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/FiveHourMarathon">u/FiveHourMarathon</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-purple-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x3t1mp/friday_fun_thread_for_september_02_2022/imtqbwo/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Probably better for WW or SQS, but to avoid ending up like u/orthoxerox...

My live-in girlfriend of one year recently told me that while she loves me, she isn&#39;t &#39;in love&#39; with me. Apparently these things are quite different for her.

Essentially, while she has loved all of her previous boyfriends, there was only one that she was &#39;in love&#39; with, who was from several years ago and not the one before me.

She told me it might take time for her to feel &#39;in love&#39;, but that if she doesn&#39;t feel it, she&#39;ll break up with me. Her parents had a nasty divorce so she&#39;s paranoid about settling down with someone who isn&#39;t her &#39;soulmate&#39;. (Not her exact words, but that was the gist of it).

Todoist caveats:

- No tracking of start date, only due date. Any task with a date configured is assumed to be a discrete amount of work to be done on the day that it is due, or shortly before.
- There is no concept of prioritization within a time window. I can&#39;t ask &quot;what is the most urgent task that I need to get done within two weeks?&quot; 
- If I have a daily recurring task and I mark it as done for yesterday, then the next occurence is tomorrow. There is no concept of catching up on overdue engagements.
