Collectivism as a different mode of being. I had always assumed that people who lean toward it do so through a conscious choice, that they think through some sort of mini social contract, judge the benefits, and accept/reject it on merit before joining a group. Also, they&#39;re conscious and watchful while part of some group so that if the group breaks the contract, they would leave it.
