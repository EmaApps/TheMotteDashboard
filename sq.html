The argument was that there are too many immune and genetic problems being introduced into the population, since all births have a higher chance of living into teenage years, whereas historically about half died in childhood. The children that died historically were the most ill. Then you have fewer generally dying from disease. Then there are not enough maximally healthy people producing children, whereas in the past they might produce a dozen.

This was very persuasive to me, but I don’t know any data.

This is a relative of, although not quite identical to, the old le atheism “why should your god *specifically* be the one” line of questioning, but it isn’t really meant as a gotcha.

For most of my adult life, I wasn&#39;t really interested in romance, relationships, or women in general. This has recently changed. I&#39;ve grown increasingly interested about the idea of falling in love and marrying someone. There are a number of reasons for this. Lately, more and more frequently I&#39;ve been feeling unhappy about being alone and lacking connections, and I like the idea of someone genuinely feeling attracted to me. I sometimes feel like my current life is pointless overall; creating a family and fathering children feels like a good way of making myself feel that I&#39;ve amounted to something. And, to be honest, I want to actually share my sexuality with another livin...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/slider5876">u/slider5876</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ieo612g/"><span title="2022-07-03 06:54:57 UTC">Jul 03, 06:54 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ieo612g/" class="extlink">Took a flight yesterday.

Serving meals on flights makes absolutely no sense, but at the same time I kind of miss it.  It had to be expensive to serve meals on flights because it’s literally added weight and taking up expensive space.  No one on the ground would pay the price I think it costs.  My guess is $20-30 a meal.  They are sort of like MRE for the military.  Very specific portion sizes.  Supposedly the portion size that a person is suppose to eat; which is smaller than what eat but then you had more courses than I eat.

From nostalgia perspective the food was different than what you would buy on the ground.  It was optimized to taste ok in the air.
