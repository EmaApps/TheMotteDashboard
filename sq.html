I think so because those on the economic left give greater weight to suffering under economic destitution than negative utility experienced by having to give away large chunks of your income, and that seems to be a well defended motte to be in, its hard to argue for the inverse. 

A truly capitalistic system would also entail tremendous short term suffering for some classes of people, for the &quot;losers&quot;. This does not imply that net utility isn&#39;t greater in the long term. But many might not have the stomach to allow for that deadwood to burn out or let those who are destined to fall through the cracks as they would, even if it means for those who wouldn&#39;t everythi...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/AndOnTheNthDay">u/AndOnTheNthDay</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v053ii/smallscale_question_sunday_for_may_29_2022/iamodfj/"><span title="2022-05-31 05:07:50 UTC">May 31, 05:07 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v053ii/smallscale_question_sunday_for_may_29_2022/iamodfj/" class="extlink">Is Monekypox a cause for concern?</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v053ii/smallscale_question_sunday_for_may_29_2022/iamodfj/" class="text-gray-500">...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/problem_redditor">u/problem_redditor</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v053ii/smallscale_question_sunday_for_may_29_2022/iakgnu7/"><span title="2022-05-30 17:45:03 UTC">May 30, 17:45 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-gray-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v053ii/smallscale_question_sunday_for_may_29_2022/iakgnu7/" class="extlink">This is perhaps a bit of an odd question, but I&#39;ll drop it in nevertheless.

Something that&#39;s necessary if you want to participate in culture war matters is understanding the phenomenon you&#39;re critiquing, but properly understanding the perspective and worldview of your opponents has a few long-term consequences.

And we get upset and taken out of the game when any ambiguity is present, eg tagging a person or “merely tagging their clothes”. If the game were just a measure of skill, such a small gap between tagging skin or clothes should not matter. Instead the win needs to be obvious and indisputable.
