I&#39;ve always wanted to flee from India for fairer shores, and while the NHS might be slowly imploding, it&#39;s *still* miles ahead of what I have to deal with here.

I&#39;ve been preparing for the British medical licensing exam there for almost a year, which is probably the longest I&#39;ve ever been able to focus on a task, although the bulk of the focused prep was in the past 3 months. And for once, I don&#39;t have that typical ADHD anxiety the night before the test, because I genuinely know I&#39;ve done all I can, I score well above the cutoff in practise tests, and unlike pretty much every exam I&#39;ve ever given, I don&#39;t find myself desperately cramming the night before to make up for not bothering before.

Maybe it&#39;s that this is something that I *want*, as opposed to entering medicine or making it through med school, a decision prompted more by the fact that there wasn&#39;t any other profession I preferred, rather than a genuine passion for it. I mostly phoned it in then, but faced with the prospect of finally striking out on my own, and making something of myself in foreign shores, I actually did things right for once.

In fact, I have more anxiety about my *lack* of anxiety than anything else, to know that I&#39;m probably going to make it through regardless of reckless scrambles is a novel feeling for me.

Wish me luck, while this isn&#39;t the end of the journey by any means, it&#39;s the first milestone along the way, and I genuinely hope I make it through. The grass may or may not be greener on the other side, but I&#39;m determined to find out for myself..</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijrj3bk/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijqkmzn/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">My current insurance has decent mental health benefits, so I figure I should use</title><updated>2022-08-10T16:35:33Z</updated><author><name>pingtings</name></author><content type="text">My current insurance has decent mental health benefits, so I figure I should use them. I&#39;ve had therapy while in college before and I&#39;m not interested in it again. The biggest benefit of therapy for me was from preparing to articulate about my thoughts and I do that now anyways in a journal. 

So now I wonder, what about psychotherapists? Where should my expectations be? Doing research on local ones, I&#39;m concerned their specialties don&#39;t apply to me (marital, anger, adhd, phobia, learning disability, etc). Should I organize all my self notes into a lengthy character study, to maximize our sessions? And so on.

To those who have had psychotherapy, which genres of contradiction did you have (or not have) success with resolving? General insights are also welcome.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijqkmzn/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijp7suz/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Worked out daily this month and did study.

I do get jaded and feel some brain fog later in the day but the moment I sit on my desk, it goes away like mist after seeing the morning sun. Same for my gym.

I did 40+ reps on the deadlift and squats on Monday and puked right after my workout due to having eaten nothing all day but 3 bananas. I am constantly hungry, sleep like a baby (slept for legit 10 hours yesterday night) and feel mentally sharp. I can feel my brain peak and dip, something I never could feel before as the entire day was foggy. 

I eat anywhere from 3 to 6 eggs daily. I would feel full at 2 earlier but feel hungry constantly now. My posture is much better. Deadlifts and Lat pulldowns fuck my back muscles up so much that I can feel them all day and they do not let me slouch. I have lost an inch or two off my waist even though I am underweight and gained a kg of weight so it is not fat.

I have done 12 videos on my playlist so far, aim is to get to 42 by the end of this week and ensure that I do 4 hours of solid undistracted work daily without fail or any breaks (by work I just mean Data Structures and Algorithms).

It is not much but I am a level 1 slime so leveling up takes time. Just need to grind and keep action as the default state.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijp7suz/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
