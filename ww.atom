I switched to 10mg XRs about a year ago, and after taking an accidental break from them for a weekend, found my depression lifting a surprising amount.  Time passes much faster, I find it easier to sleep.  I find it easier to think creatively.  My performance at work is suffering, but coffee+nicotine+weak weed seems to be getting me through this week compared to last week.  I feel less helpless anxiety when faced with tasks.  I feel better able to keep myself company.

I still hate my life, but the experience of living it is less irritating to me now.  

I&#39;m going to see a different, less-intrusive doctor and get switched back to regular release, maybe up the daily dosage to 20, but see if I can get by only taking 10 or 15.  I just know the XRs aren&#39;t for me.

Has anyone else had similar experiences with XRs vs regulars?  Did you find an alternative to Adderall?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih7pji9/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih6qjeu/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">I was laid off for the first time in my professional career this week.

My (previous) company dropped about 30% of its workforce.

All in all, it isn&#39;t so bad. They paid good severance and it looks like the labor market is still pretty strong in my area (software engineering). I will also likely get a significant pay bump in my next position.

And yet the entire process has just kinda left my feeling crummy. I (obviously) knew that this sort of thing can happen but the immediate impact of my career and (short term) livelihood being in the hands of someone I don&#39;t know -- where I am just basically a row on a spreadsheet that they&#39;re washing their hands of -- does not feel good. I also really liked the people I worked with (and this seems really hard to screen for ahead of time IMO, more of a crapshoot) and we worked remotely throughout the country, so will likely not really every see one another again. 

My life is pretty hectic at home with a young child at the moment but I definitely want to start thinking about diversifying my income stream outside of just one job.

Not sure the point of this post, just venting I guess.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih6qjeu/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih1pz9v/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Are salt intake guidelines too low?

The FDA recommends eating less than a teaspoon of salt per day, while animals our size generally eat a quarter to a third of an oz per day.  
I don&#39;t eat any processed food, so the only salt I get is on meat and fried eggs. Have been developing salt cravings this summer to the point that livestock mineral salt looks really delicious, which is a pretty reliable sign I&#39;m missing _something_.   
Everything out there is just yelling at people not to eat salt, but maybe someone here has done some proper research?

Bonus question: other than a costco multivitamin, what&#39;s a good extra source of zinc and other useful minerals?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih1pz9v/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih1erlm/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Another month, another post about relentless negative thoughts.

Mostly surrounding the gym, my lack of progress, and generally feeling weak, lazy, fat, etc. Weight gain has unfortunately mostly stalled, due to working a physically demanding job with few opportunities to eat... but difficult to escape the belief that any weight gained wouldn&#39;t just be fat anyway. Have started running again with a friend (who has serious problems controlling his weight). I tend to get awful soreness/tightness in my shins, but seems to be getting less bad. Another friend has returned to the gym with me too, which is nice, except that it&#39;s because he broke up with his girlfriend, so it feels a little bit wrong to take pleasure from a bad event like that.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih1erlm/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/igz1v8u/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Herman Miller chairs - expensive meme or ergonomic dream?</title><updated>2022-07-20T22:08:07Z</updated><author><name>Atersed</name></author><content type="text">Herman Miller chairs - expensive meme or ergonomic dream?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/igz1v8u/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/igyyi6u/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">I quit drinking and vaping.

According to Fitbit my resting heart rate is already 10bpm lower, and my HRV is 20ms+ higher.

I’ve tried to quit numerous times but I think this is the actual time. I’m just tired of feeling like dog shit most of the time. I’m tired and haven’t been exercising like I used to.

Vaping was always dumb, I don’t even want that in my life. But I can’t resist it when I’m drunk, and I’m always around it, so I ended up just doing it by default.

Alcohol is mostly just nice because it’s weird to not drink, at least in my friend group. So it’s just avoiding that whole awkwardness. But, it does seem like it’s getting more common to encounter people who don’t drink. Maybe that’s just because I’m getting older. In any case, I’m starting to give less of a fuck about that. Just let me live my life, I don’t need to put garbage in my body just to make you feel better.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/igyyi6u/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/igym84d/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Any advice for joint issues?
