I&#39;ve always wanted to flee </a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijrj3bk/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">from India for fairer shores, and while the NHS might be slowly imploding, it&#39;s *still* miles ahead of what I have to deal with here.

I&#39;ve been preparing for the British medical licensing exam there for almost a year, which is probably the longest I&#39;ve ever been able to focus on a task, although the bulk of the focused prep was in the past 3 months. And for once, I don&#39;t have that typical ADHD anxiety the night before the test, because I genuinely know I&#39;ve done all I can, I score well above the cutoff in practise tests, and unlike pretty much every exam I&#39;ve ever given, I don&#39;t find myself desperately cramming the night before to make up for not bothering before.

Maybe it&#39;s that this is s...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/pingtings">u/pingtings</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijqkmzn/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-10 16:35:33 UTC">Aug 10, 16:35 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-green-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijqkmzn/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">My current insurance has decent mental health benefits, so I figure I should use</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijqkmzn/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500"> them. I&#39;ve had therapy while in college before and I&#39;m not interested in it again. The biggest benefit of therapy for me was from preparing to articulate about my thoughts and I do that now anyways in a journal. 

So now I wonder, what about psychotherapists? Where should my expectations be? Doing research on local ones, I&#39;m concerned their specialties don&#39;t apply to me (marital, anger, adhd, phobia, learning disability, etc). Should I organize all my self notes into a lengthy character study, to maximize our sessions? And so on.

To those who have had psychotherapy, which genres of contradiction did you have (or not have) success with resolving? General insights are also welcome....</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/practical_romantic">u/practical_romantic</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijp7suz/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-10 10:14:57 UTC">Aug 10, 10:14 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-green-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijp7suz/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Worked out daily this month and did study.

Same for my gym.

I did 40+ reps on the deadlift and squats on Monday and puked right after my workout due to having eaten nothing all day but 3 bananas. I am constantly hungry, sleep like a baby (slept for legit 10 hours yesterday night) and feel mentally sharp. I can feel my brain peak and dip, something I never could feel before as the entire day was foggy. 

I eat anywhere from 3 to 6 eggs daily. I would feel full at 2 earlier but feel hungry constantly now. My posture is much better. Deadlifts and Lat pulldowns fuck my back muscles up so much that I can feel them all day and they do ...</a></blockquote></div></li></ul></div><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-sm text-gray-400">Generated on <span title="2022-08-13 02:03:17.580290139 UTC">Aug 13, 02:03 UTC</span></div></div><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-sm text-gray-500"><p>Powered by <a class="font-semibold" href="https://ema.srid.ca">Ema</a> | <a href="https://github.com/EmaApps/TheMotteDashboard">Source &amp; Feedback</a></p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
