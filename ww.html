Week 2/60 is behind me. Not much to report. Water fasted Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and today. 2 more weeks until I begin resistance training and trying to put on muscle. Shedding fat at a crazy rate but perceptibly losing muscle mass as well as to be expected. I can notice a tiny bit of loose skin around my abdomen in dim lighting but not as bad as I feared. No clue whether fasting is helping on that front but still seems worthwhile since I am leaning out so fast. Am extremely eager to hit the weights in a few weeks. I will post before once I am done dieting in a few weeks.

Current plan is to fast Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday next week. ...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/cae_jones">u/cae_jones</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifkz35p/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-10 10:51:07 UTC">Jul 10, 10:51 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-green-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifkz35p/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">So a few months ago, I stumbled upon the [Healthy Gamer Youtube channel](https:/</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifkz35p/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">/m.youtube.com/channel/UClHVl2N3jPEbkNJVx-ItQIQ), and found some of the suggestions there helpful as regards creative projects.

They’ve always hated that I cut the sibling off and have continually pressured me to reconnect for years. The estrangement has gone on since 2010.

The sibling was physically abusive toward me, as well as very emotionally abusive. I have other siblings and they maintain a relationship with this one. When the estranged sibling comes up in conversation with the other siblings, it is almost always complaints about their abusive behavior. Which leads me to believe I made the right decision for my own sanity, and that the behavior that precipitated the estrangement is ongoing. 

This situation with our parent has led the abusive sibling to reac...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/Then_Election_7412">u/Then_Election_7412</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifih61c/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-09 20:09:40 UTC">Jul 09, 20:09 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-green-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifih61c/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">I&#39;m not interested in the CW aspects of this and more about the social managemen</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifih61c/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500">t and relationship building aspects:

No career, no CV, no friends. Not that I alienated them, a little of that, but mostly,  I had few friends, and they all drifted away after I dropped out of uni.
