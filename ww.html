They&#39;re not, so I can&#39;t. Don&#39;t know what to do with myself.

No career, no CV, no friends. Not that I alienated them, a little of that, but mostly,  I had few friends, and they all drifted away after I dropped out of uni.  Before that, friends from high school drifted away because I went to another city for uni.No context anymore, and I felt ashamed too. I don&#39;t feel like getting to know any people. There&#39;s nothing I can offer them, and where would I get to know them anyway ? Gym ? People go there to exercise, not to socialise.

Due to general awkwardness and being busy during college and grad school, I&#39;ve never kissed a guy or been on a date, but girls have definitely liked me, so I think I would do alright if I could just meet some gay guys that are at least slightly nerdy. My question is then how to do that.
