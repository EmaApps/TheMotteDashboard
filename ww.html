Time passes much faster, I find it easier to sleep.  I find it easier to think creatively.  My performance at work is suffering, but coffee+nicotine+weak weed seems to be getting me through this week compared to last week.  I feel less helpless anxiety when faced with tasks.  I feel better able to keep myself company.

I still hate my life, but the experience of living it is less irritating to me now.  

I&#39;m going to see a different, less-intrusive doctor and get switched back to regular release, maybe up the daily dosage to 20, but see if I can get by only taking 10 or 15.

All in all, it isn&#39;t so bad. They paid good severance and it looks like the labor market is still pretty strong in my area (software engineering). I will also likely get a significant pay bump in my next position.

And yet the entire process has just kinda left my feeling crummy. I (obviously) knew that this sort of thing can happen but the immediate impact of my career and (short term) livelihood being in the hands of someone I don&#39;t know -- where I am just basically a row on a spreadsheet that they&#39;re washing their hands of -- does not feel good.

I don&#39;t eat any processed food, so the only salt I get is on meat and fried eggs. Have been developing salt cravings this summer to the point that livestock mineral salt looks really delicious, which is a pretty reliable sign I&#39;m missing _something_.   
Everything out there is just yelling at people not to eat salt, but maybe someone here has done some proper research?

Bonus question: other than a costco multivitamin, what&#39;s a good extra source of zinc and other useful minerals?...</a></blockquote></div></li><li class="mt-4"><div class="text-sm flex flex-row flex-nowrap justify-between pr-1"><div><code><a href="u/Anouleth">u/Anouleth</a></code></div><div><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih1erlm/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-21 11:51:48 UTC">Jul 21, 11:51 UTC</span></a></div></div><div class="pt-2"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-green-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih1erlm/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Another month, another post about relentless negative thoughts.

I’ve tried to quit numerous times but I think this is the actual time. I’m just tired of feeling like dog shit most of the time. I’m tired and haven’t been exercising like I used to.

Vaping was always dumb, I don’t even want that in my life. But I can’t resist it when I’m drunk, and I’m always around it, so I ended up just doing it by default.

Alcohol is mostly just nice because it’s weird to not drink, at least in my friend group. So it’s just avoiding that whole awkwardness. But, it does seem like it’s getting more common to encounter people who don’t drink. Maybe that’s just because I’m getting older.
