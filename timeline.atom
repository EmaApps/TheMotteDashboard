While his life and death aren&#39;t culture wars material per se, I wanted to mention his passing because his work was *immensely* influential on me as a kid. Specifically, when I was about 7 years old, I read his graphic novel [When The Wind Blows](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/When-the-Wind-Blows), and accidentally saw [the TV adaptation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJKdTqYijY) a few years later. In a departure from his previous work aimed at children, this was a &#34;comic book&#34; about nuclear war. Even more specifically, it&#39;s about an elderly English couple who follow every bit of government advice, and slowly, painfully die of radiation sickness in the wake of a nuclear attack on the UK.

I cannot emphasise enough how much anxiety and trauma this caused me as a child. I was lucky enough to avoid a religious upbringing, but suddenly, I became aware of civilisational-level threats and the horror of the apocalypse. I literally took weeks off school because I was vomiting from fear of nuclear attack, a condition that only eased when puberty hit and I became worried about much more sensible things like not having a large enough penis.

While at some level I resent Briggs (and my parents!) for exposing me to such existential horror at such a young age, I&#39;m also very grateful. I do think the world is a safer place in virtue of this kind of protest comic. It also set in motion a lifelong coping strategy for me - when faced with something terrifying, I resolved to learn as much as possible about it, so that the emotional was replaced by the intellectual. In my late prepubescent years, I became fascinated by nuclear weapons and prepping, and to this day, I make sure to keep potassium iodide pills in the house. Somehow by turning horrors into intellectual problems, they lose their terror.

In any case, Raymond Briggs&#39;s work helped make me who I am today. May the man rest in peace, and his work continue to (appropriately, within reason) traumatise generations yet to come.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijx1bm6/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijwypi3/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Another entry in the Inflation Reduction Act effort, this time covering some of </title><updated>2022-08-11T21:57:44Z</updated><author><name>xablor</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Another entry in the Inflation Reduction Act effort, this time covering some of the proposed uses of all that money. u/Sorie_K and u/netstack_ ably covered the huge Title I, and I attempted to cover as much of the rest as I could, working backwards. I&#39;m more than out of time, but I&#39;m pleased that I managed to line-by-line Titles II through VIII, some 200 pages, so here&#39;s my attempt at a summary. This will necessarily be high-level; my low-level summaries are available at [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative\_analysis\_of\_the\_inflation\_reduction/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative_analysis_of_the_inflation_reduction/), with a top level thread for each title, and summaries under each.

My first impression is of how /sane/ all this seems - accepting the premise that we will all literally die if we&#39;re not net-zero by 2050 (or whatever goal is being set for whatever reason, don&#39;t @ me) - this is a legitimate full-court press to electrify GHG producers, enable consumer and industrial deployment of low-emissions tech and enhanced energy efficiency, deploy renewable energy at scale, adapt to incoming warming and extreme weather, and enable research into new forms of renewable energy. I&#39;m not cynical enough to reliably detect opportunities for patronage and corruption, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s there, but a LOT of these funds are pretty tightly targeted. They&#39;re even market-y in most places: using them for loan guarantee programs is frequently explicitly allowed, public/private cost sharing is sometimes required. The whole thing reads as though you asked 7 different specialist committees to ask their SMEs to dig out their best ideas, harden them into operationalizable proposals, and then have the lawyers translate it into Congress-flavored legalese.

As a wrinkle that I&#39;m not sure how to fit elsewhere, there&#39;s a good chunk of money allocated for environmental review improvements: S70007 gives 70M to the Environmental Review Improvement Fund under the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council; S60402 gives 30M to the Council on Economic Quality for general operations and review enhancements; S60115 gives EPA 850M for improved review and permitting processes; 40003 gives NOAA 150M for improved review and permitting processes; S50301, -2, -3 gives 375M for improvements to environmental reviews and authorizations to Sec of Energy, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Sec of Interior; S23001 gets 100M to provide more effective and efficient reviews. This totals 1.575B, casually. I happened to run across a passed Senate Resolution in the Congressional Record for 2022-8-4 that would undo a rule currently requiring environmental impact statements to include indirect and cumulative impacts; it&#39;s S J Res 55 for this Congress, it&#39;s got all 50 Republicans and 0 Democrats, and /I don&#39;t understand why/. It&#39;s referred to House Committee, where it&#39;ll die or get stonewalled, but it&#39;s an interesting opening for construction maximalism, which seems necessary to achieve the construction bandwidth needed for all these large-scale climate projects. I really hope that someone wiser than me can weigh in here, because I have no idea what to make of this development that smells so much of the Shadow Congress quietly getting big things done.

Of the functional goals of the bill given in the one-page summary at [https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22122297-inflation\_reduction\_act\_one\_page\_summary](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22122297-inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary) , these titles only implement #2: &#39;Lowers energy costs, increases cleaner production, and reduces carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030&#39;. This is is only slightly duplicitous:  there are programs for retrofitting cleaner and more efficient industrial processes, and under ideal conditions and friendly analysis 40% reduction from predicted emissions is achievable, but the energy costs aspect seems to be on the demand side, due to more newer and more efficient appliances, better insulation and sealing, demand-shifting tech, and distributed power generation via rooftop PV and thermal solar.

I didn&#39;t pick up on a lot of opportunities for diversion, patronage, winner-choosing, vote-buying, or similar abuses, though of course the sheer scale makes waste and fraud inevitable. Most Inspector General offices are getting additional funding, which should help. S13103 is specifically for solar and wind facilities serving low-income communities. 22004 is about disadvantaged rural communities. S50121 sets aside money specifically for encouraging work in underserved communities. 50231 is specifically for water supply projects for disadvantaged communities. 60103 targets GHG emissions in disadvantaged communities. 60104 tries to reduce diesel emissions in poor communities. 60105 targets air quality sensors in low-income communities. 60106 targets air quality emissions at schools in poor communities. 60201 is specifically for &#34;Environmental and Climate Justic Block Grants&#34;, and is fairly blatantly loose, including &#34;facilitating engagement of disadvantaged communities in State and Federal public processes&#34;. 60501 tries to fix highways cutting poor neighborhoods in half, improving walkability. Nonprofit orgs are eligible for grants for a few sections, but the purposes are usually tightly scoped. S4001 targets nonprofits &#34;to enable coastal communities to prepare for extreme storms and other changing climate conditions&#34;, which strikes me as usefully loose.

I&#39;m out of words, here, please let fly with comments,  corrections, or followup questions I can work on.

A pithy statement of it is &#34;Never dine alone with a woman&#34;. For Pence, it goes a bit further and he also won&#39;t consume alcohol without his wife present.   
  
When this came to light after Pence&#39;s vice presidential nomination in 2016, it inspired a furor overnight. Some [claimed it was sexist](https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-abcarian-pence-marriage-20170405-story.html), [Kamala Harris called it &#34;outrageous&#34;](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/14/kamala-harris-pence-women-1221741), and some commentators have even [questioned its legality](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/3/31/15132730/pence-women-alone-rule-graham-discrimination). On the other hand, you have people claiming this is good or inevitable. [One example of the latter](https://wyborcza.pl/Jutronauci/7,165057,25453074,dukaj-wyrazam-niewiare.html) comes from a Polish sci-fi author some of you may be familiar with. In his opinion, movements like #MeToo make Pence&#39;s personal code of etiquette unavoidable because there aren&#39;t other ways to avoid the implied &#34;New Puritanism&#34;. Quoting from [the *Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/pence-wife-billy-graham-rule/521298/), &#34;Socially liberal or non-religious people may see Pence’s practice as misogynistic or bizarre. For a lot of conservative religious people, though, this set-up probably sounds normal, or even wise. The dust-up shows how radically notions of gender divide American culture.&#34; With a description as apt as that, whatever you feel about it, Pence&#39;s personal is now [certainly political](https://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=0ba7b595-8da9-4e63-a0ec-aec0639e4af6).  

So what happens when we have a society-wide experiment in forcing Pence&#39;s rule on people? [A recent preprint](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105976) alleged that was exactly what happened in the area of economic research. The TL;DR of the result is that post-#MeToo, male economists became more wary of collaborating with female economists. This effect was stronger when university policies on &#34;impersonal harassment&#34; were more ambiguous and when the number of past public sexual harassment cases at a university was higher. The effects are a bit scattered, but some clear findings ring out. Despite their proportions of the sample remaining unchanged despite #MeToo, female economists became less productive afterwards. This reduced productivity can be substantially (60%) attributed to the direct effects of having fewer collaborations with male economists, whose own productivity hasn&#39;t been affected. The effect on female economists&#39; productivity was broad. Female economists were not less likely to work with women alone or women and men together, but they were less likely to work with men alone. This extended to new projects and new papers. They were not less likely to collaborate with untenured colleagues, but they were less likely to collaborate with tenured people, and this seems to be due to the fact that the tenured colleagues were at higher-ranking universities, which saw larger reductions in cross-sex collaboration. After #MeToo, female economists were less likely to initiate new projects with new and existing coauthors and this effect was due to reductions in the numbers of new projects with new coauthors inside the university and of new projects with new coauthors outside of their university. The same pattern was seen for coauthorships more generally.   

So this paper argues that what happens when we start practicing what we&#39;re told in 2 Timothy 2:22 is that women take a professional hit. The author of this paper offered [two](https://twitter.com/marinambgg/status/1557714978747981824) [stories](https://twitter.com/marinambgg/status/1557714981587546114) to explain these results.  

&amp;gt;Men think “#MeToo means if I accidentally say the wrong thing, I’ll be cancelled/fired. I’d better stay away from women.” Clear policies show that “saying the wrong thing” doesn’t get you cancelled/fired, so clear policies reduce men’s (perceived) risk of #MeToo. 

and  

&amp;gt;Women think “#MeToo means I don’t have to work with the predator men anymore, so I’ll avoid them.” If that’s the story, we should see the decrease in collaborations regardless of whether policies are clear or not.  
 
And, to be fair, both of these stories might be true to different degrees. Policy ambiguity does not explain the whole reduction in collaborations. Because this *is* the case, unless the authors&#39; policy ambiguity measures weren&#39;t good enough, her suggestion that &#34;#MeToo plus clear policies could create awareness for sexual harassment without hurting women’s productivity&#34; may be misguided. Sure, ambiguity reduction looks like it could cut against these changes a bit, but if we trust her measurement we have to conclude that the damage is done. #MeToo has made us all evangelicals, and women are some of the victims of that change.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijwb99h/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijvrw9p/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Are we seeing a correction in practice for transgender issues?

I&#39;ve seen several signals this year that indicate the tide is shifting away from the affirmative care model.

[The Tavistock clinic](https://archive.ph/TM9LO#selection-295.52-299.145) has been shut down.  The NYT makes it sound like long waitlists are the main reason the UK is ditching this model, but another very strong reason is because the clinic ignored mental health issues in favor of beginning medical transition.  The clinic faces a [class action lawsuit](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/4e7fc538-18dc-11ed-b1f4-627a202c7457?shareToken=8c10508fb9e9acdd02579f7a5207924c) from families who believe their child was negligently misdiagnosed by the clinic.  

An independent review of the Gender Identity Development Service by [Dr Hilary Cass](https://cass.independent-review.uk/publications/interim-report/) appears to be a significant catalyst.  The key points from an interim report are:

&amp;gt;The rapid increase in the number of children requiring support and the complex case-mix means that the current clinical model, with a single national provider, is not sustainable in the longer term. 

&amp;gt;We need to know more about the population being referred and outcomes. There has not been routine and consistent data collection, which means it is not possible to accurately track the outcomes and pathways that children and young people take through the service.  

&amp;gt;There is lack of consensus and open discussion about the nature of gender dysphoria and therefore about the appropriate clinical response. 

&amp;gt;Because the specialist service has evolved rapidly and organically in response to demand, the clinical approach and overall service design has not been subjected to some of the normal quality controls that are typically applied when new or innovative treatments are introduced.   

Finland and Sweden have likewise changed their guidelines on how to treat gender dysphoria in children.  The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare has released a [new set of guidelines](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/globalassets/sharepoint-dokument/artikelkatalog/kunskapsstod/2022-3-7799.pdf):

&amp;gt;For adolescents with gender incongruence, the NBHW deems that
the risks of puberty suppressing treatment with GnRH-analogues
and gender-affirming hormonal treatment currently outweigh the
possible benefits, and that the treatments should be offered only in
exceptional cases. This judgement is based mainly on three factors:
the continued lack of reliable scientific evidence concerning the
efficacy and the safety of both treatments [2], the new knowledge
that detransition occurs among young adults [3], and the uncertainty that follows from the yet unexplained increase in the number
of care seekers, an increase particularly large among adolescents
registered as females at birth [4]

[Finland released a report with similar guidelines.](https://segm.org/sites/default/files/Finnish_Guidelines_2020_Minors_Unofficial%20Translation.pdf)  

Overall it seems to me that parts of Europe are moving more towards the *actual* Dutch protocol and becoming more cautious about providing medical interventions to gender non-conforming youth.  I have not seen any evidence that this shift might happen in America or Canada though.  Is America lagging behind Europe or is the affirmative care and informed consent model here to stay?  

Lastly, the reason this post came together today is because of a thread in the SeattleWA subreddit.   There are a few Seattle subreddits, SeattleWA is the more right-leaning.  It&#39;s still pretty left leaning, earlier this week there were people arguing against voting for an independent candidate in case they were a secret Republican.  (They were not, they are actually further left of the Democratic candidate.)  So it&#39;s &#34;right for Seattle&#34; which is still pretty left for much of America.  

Someone posted a link to a news article about a YMCA transwoman employee being harassed by an 80 year old woman who felt there shouldn&#39;t be a male helping little girls pull down their swimsuits to go potty.  The old woman was banned from the Y due to the incident.   I would expect the comments to be supportive of the trans employee and less supportive of the old lady.  However, that is not what happened.  [See here](https://archive.ph/bdp2r), but most people felt like they wouldn&#39;t want a transwoman helping their small daughters use the toilet.  

Other recent events like Lia Thomas&#39; infamy seems to indicate that people don&#39;t really mean &#34;Trans women are woman&#34; in all situations.  I&#39;m wondering if we&#39;ll see an ideological shift happen in America before we see a medical care model shift.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijvrw9p/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijurnpj/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] [deleted]</title><updated>2022-08-11T13:26:48Z</updated><author><name>[deleted]</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">[deleted]</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijurnpj/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijtgwi4/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] EDIT: [My apologies, this may have all been bullshit.](https://twitter.com/Ashle</title><updated>2022-08-11T04:36:10Z</updated><author><name>HalloweenSnarry</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">EDIT: [My apologies, this may have all been bullshit.](https://twitter.com/AshleyLatke/status/1557430756267511808) Original post follows below.

Dispatches from the War on Horny, per Dexerto: [OnlyFans bribed Meta into suppressing competitor sites by having models on said sites labeled as &#34;terrorists&#34; on FB and Instagram.](https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1557491228232622081)

I&#39;m reminded of the recent story about PredictIt losing the legal cover it had, along with the allegation that rival site Kalshi basically engaged in [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) to get the CFTC to not only approve them, but de-approve PredictIt.

This is a story not merely about how society treats sex work, but more about how sex work is the canary in the coal mine that often exposes the ways in which our economic system fails. First there was deplatforming and the impossibilities of &#34;building your own&#34; (a story that also involved OnlyFans), now there is the reminder that sufficiently-large actors can wield enough clout to just *ask* platform-holders to essentially put their competitors out of business. Now, if you&#39;re reading this, chances are you&#39;re likely about to respond about how government regulation actually enforces monopolies, but this story is about Facebook (granted, maybe this isn&#39;t much different depending on how much you believe that FB is essentially an arm of the US Government), who effectively controls a large chunk of the modern surface internet.

It&#39;s one thing for there to be rules and regulations in place, but much of our legal landscape is in effect very malleable and prone to change on the say-so of ultimately-human agents. Of course, I know that money and words have always been weaknesses in our democratic institutions, but this is just more grist for the mill of &#34;the real power is not just in Washington.&#34;</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijtgwi4/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijsuiyy/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] For a blast from the past, [Alex Jones has just finished up with a one of multip</title><updated>2022-08-11T01:32:43Z</updated><author><name>DrManhattan16</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">For a blast from the past, [Alex Jones has just finished up with a one of multiple lawsuits he&#39;s involved in](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/alex-jones-law-suit-verdict-sandy-hook-case-scare-conspiracy-theorists-rcna41828).

The lawsuits were about his messages calling Sandy Hook a fake school shooting and saying the parents were crisis actors. Jones obviously moved on once the shooting was no longer relevant, but his actions led to his followers harassing the parents in question. Some accounts of that harassment can be found here: [1](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/09/the-sandy-hook-hoax.html), [2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/08/sandy-hook-hoaxer-gets-prison-time-for-threatening-6-year-old-victims-father/). It&#39;s difficult to conclusively define his impact, so I can&#39;t really say if he&#39;s the originator of the hoax claim. There are more conspiracy theorists with large followings than Jones, and ideas can occur independently at the same time. But Jones&#39; status makes it likely many people heard the &#34;Sandy Hook was a hoax&#34; line from him in one way or the other and some acted on it.

A big point about this lawsuit and Jones&#39; conduct in general has been the refusal to obey judicial orders or not follow court rules in general. Jones, his lawyers, his company, and whoever was involved in his defense don&#39;t seem to have done a very good job, his lawyer straight up sent Jones&#39; phone records to the plaintiffs&#39; lawyer, who said that Jones basically lied about actually trying to see if he had any records about Sandy Hook.

That said, [he&#39;s admitted under oath that he does think the school shooting actually happened](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/sandy-hook-parents-alex-jones-claims-created-living-87866827), which seems on brand for Jones as someone who doesn&#39;t actually believe what he&#39;s saying. Of course, he added that he&#39;d apparently love to recant his mistake, but the media won&#39;t let him. He&#39;s also said he apparently wanted to apologize to the parents, but given how many years its been, it&#39;s clear this is throwing anything at the wall to see if something sticks.

The lawsuits are not satisfying for anyone, I think. Jones&#39; defenders can tell themselves that this trial was really only decided by legal technicalities and the actual facts were never put under examination, a similar claim to one that some people here have made regarding 2020 election lawsuits. For those who want to see Jones taken down, the amount of money is basically nothing to him. Some are calling for Jones to see trial for perjury (he lied multiple times under oath in this trial) and his phone records are apparently being sent at request to the Jan 6th committee, so look forward to that in the future.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijsuiyy/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijrj3bk/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Aight lads, the moment of reckoning is here for me.

I&#39;ve always wanted to flee from India for fairer shores, and while the NHS might be slowly imploding, it&#39;s *still* miles ahead of what I have to deal with here.

I&#39;ve been preparing for the British medical licensing exam there for almost a year, which is probably the longest I&#39;ve ever been able to focus on a task, although the bulk of the focused prep was in the past 3 months. And for once, I don&#39;t have that typical ADHD anxiety the night before the test, because I genuinely know I&#39;ve done all I can, I score well above the cutoff in practise tests, and unlike pretty much every exam I&#39;ve ever given, I don&#39;t find myself desperately cramming the night before to make up for not bothering before.

Maybe it&#39;s that this is something that I *want*, as opposed to entering medicine or making it through med school, a decision prompted more by the fact that there wasn&#39;t any other profession I preferred, rather than a genuine passion for it. I mostly phoned it in then, but faced with the prospect of finally striking out on my own, and making something of myself in foreign shores, I actually did things right for once.

In fact, I have more anxiety about my *lack* of anxiety than anything else, to know that I&#39;m probably going to make it through regardless of reckless scrambles is a novel feeling for me.

Wish me luck, while this isn&#39;t the end of the journey by any means, it&#39;s the first milestone along the way, and I genuinely hope I make it through. The grass may or may not be greener on the other side, but I&#39;m determined to find out for myself..</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijrj3bk/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijr0gxb/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Today marks four years since Richard Russell stole a plane from SeaTac airport, </title><updated>2022-08-10T18:12:41Z</updated><author><name>SaxifragetheGreen</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Today marks four years since Richard Russell stole a plane from SeaTac airport, did a barrel roll, then crashed into a remote island. RIP Skyking.

This story has always held my attention, and I must admit to a certain amount of wistful fascination with the entire episode. The story of a nobody who does something extraordinary, even though it meant his death. There&#39;s something glorious about it. Despite the need to avoid glorifying a man stealing an airplane to take it on a joyride, I can&#39;t help but admire him. 

There aren&#39;t many other things I can think of that are simultaneously ill-advised and wonderfully glorious. The one that came to mind, that has a similar feeling to me, is Alex Honnold, the man who freeclimbed El Capitan. Like stealing an airplane, freeclimbing El Capitan is ill-advised, and yet undeniably glorious. Obviously Alex didn&#39;t have to steal anything, and Alex didn&#39;t die doing it. Alex planned, and didn&#39;t break any laws. But still. The feeling I get from both resonate, harmonize. Maybe it&#39;s close to the admiration I have for Ted Kaczynski, who more than all else lived his morals and implemented them as he saw fit. Of course, while Alex didn&#39;t kill anyone and didn&#39;t die, and Richard didn&#39;t kill anyone but himself, Ted killed other people, and is still alive (for now). Ted&#39;s not glorious, not like Alex, not like Richard, even. Maybe I&#39;m just a sucker for iconoclasts, and don&#39;t have the moral fortitude to decry their transgressions. Maybe I&#39;m just confused.

I don&#39;t really have a point with this post, other than to mark the anniversary of Richard&#39;s flight. I&#39;d be curious to know if this story affected anyone here like it did me, if anyone can recognize the kind of wistfulness I feel, and if there are any other people or stories who make them feel the same way. Maybe there&#39;s a German word that describes it, one I don&#39;t know.

I&#39;ve had therapy while in college before and I&#39;m not interested in it again. The biggest benefit of therapy for me was from preparing to articulate about my thoughts and I do that now anyways in a journal. 

So now I wonder, what about psychotherapists? Where should my expectations be? Doing research on local ones, I&#39;m concerned their specialties don&#39;t apply to me (marital, anger, adhd, phobia, learning disability, etc). Should I organize all my self notes into a lengthy character study, to maximize our sessions? And so on.

To those who have had psychotherapy, which genres of contradiction did you have (or not have) success with resolving?

The &#34;left-center&#34; anti-right alliance collapsed after 5 days when the leader of Azione (3% party, center-leftish pro-Draghi) left it when the PD (main center-left party) decided to include inside the Sinistra Italiana and the Greens (3% together) in the grand-coalition. 

Azione was also part of another small coalition with the Soros-funded Più Europa party (2%), alliance that collapsed with accusation of betrayal launched against each other. 

- the left accuse Calenda of being a liberal centrist always allied with fascism
- the center left and Più Europa, apart from the fascist libel, are also desperate because Azione was a party liked by a certain kind of leftish intellighenzia more near to the ex-Premier Draghi
- Calenda attacked everyone, saying that Pd and Più Europa did not respected the pact of forming a &#34;Pro-Draghi coalition&#34;, preferring the leftist parties

In general, the grand coalition is not working. The small left is candidating africans and gays, while the center left candidates neoliberal economists and feminists, while everyone complains that, if they are not going to sustain each other, the right &#34;will win&#34; 

The right has also internal problems (Especially with Berlusconi&#39;s Forza Italia, 7%, that lost a big chunk of the leadership to Azione after the fall of Draghi&#39;s government), but they appear more united and less catty. 

Medias are pumping stories daily on black people being beaten or discriminated or gay people, but the survey say that the right coalition can win more than 2/3 of the parlamentarians both in the chamber or in the Senate. 

While the right post cringe boomer memes as their method of propaganda, the other side is going hard on the &#34;vote us or Orban (!!!) wins&#34; 

It is not working.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijpo106/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijp7suz/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Worked out daily this month and did study.

I do get jaded and feel some brain fog later in the day but the moment I sit on my desk, it goes away like mist after seeing the morning sun. Same for my gym.

I did 40+ reps on the deadlift and squats on Monday and puked right after my workout due to having eaten nothing all day but 3 bananas. I am constantly hungry, sleep like a baby (slept for legit 10 hours yesterday night) and feel mentally sharp. I can feel my brain peak and dip, something I never could feel before as the entire day was foggy. 

I eat anywhere from 3 to 6 eggs daily. I would feel full at 2 earlier but feel hungry constantly now. My posture is much better. Deadlifts and Lat pulldowns fuck my back muscles up so much that I can feel them all day and they do not let me slouch. I have lost an inch or two off my waist even though I am underweight and gained a kg of weight so it is not fat.

I have done 12 videos on my playlist so far, aim is to get to 42 by the end of this week and ensure that I do 4 hours of solid undistracted work daily without fail or any breaks (by work I just mean Data Structures and Algorithms).

It is not much but I am a level 1 slime so leveling up takes time.

At least one tip to the police was from a redditor in the Albuquerque subreddit who methodically searched Google Streetview for the suspect’s Jetta, which had small but significant damage in one place.

The killer targeted local Muslim men, mostly Shia but one Sunni. He lay in wait for his victims, hinting that he knew them personally. The community was devastated by the deaths and was also devastated by the killer’s identity: a Sunni gentleman who was known to be a bit off his rocker, and seems to have been motivated by his son marrying a Shiite girl.

The Albuquerque subreddit, a progressivist haven as most default-named subs tend to be, instantly stopped calling for fire to rain down from Washington DC onto Albuquerque’s red-hatted bigots, and started thoughtfully bemoaning extremism and mental health issues. They did manage to find a few outgroup tags to apply to the suspect, whose shares his first name with his Prophet and a few of his victims.

EDIT: I was just reported for a violent comment in the Albuquerque sub wherein I said (before his religion and race were known) that I hope the suspect gets the death penalty, in the form of a public hanging, after a fair trial and all applicable appeals, instead of life in prison. I got the warning only *after* it became known he’s a non-white Muslim with longstanding mental health issues.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijothr6/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijngiha/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Is there even any point to right-wing political victories when the left continue</title><updated>2022-08-09T23:55:11Z</updated><author><name>Lorelei_On_The_Rocks</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Is there even any point to right-wing political victories when the left continues to control the cultural means of production?

(See also [this episode of *Volts*](https://www.volts.wtf/p/volts-podcast-what-to-make-of-the).)

This is inside-baseball among climate activists, but I thought it was interesting enough to lay out here.

The [Inflation Reduction Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act_of_2022) is, [as Michael Sweeney predicted](https://nitter.it/mtsw/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;q=inflation+reduction&amp;amp;since=&amp;amp;until=2022-01-31&amp;amp;near=), part of Build Back Better wearing a different hat, but adjusted significantly to appeal to Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Some Mottians [are doing a collaborative analysis here](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative_analysis_of_the_inflation_reduction/).

A central tradeoff is in [section 50625](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22122281/inflation_reduction_act_of_2022.pdf#page=644), which requires that for wind and solar to be developed on federal lands, two million acres of land and sixty million offshore acres of federal land must be offered for lease for oil and gas development. (Note that private and public lands are somewhat fungible, all offers are not leased, and all leases are not developed.)

Adam McKay and David Sirota are the screenwriters of *Don&#39;t Look Up* (previously [reviewed on ACX here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/movie-review-dont-look-up)), with 1.3 million Twitter followers between them. They&#39;ve been *very angry* about this deal. ([Example from Sirota](https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1556487558510821376), [from McKay](https://twitter.com/GhostPanther/status/1556745117838430208).) This has led to some [moderately funny beclownening](https://twitter.com/Wertwhile/status/1556278768674566145), and [is the same line being pushed by some Republicans](https://popular.info/p/the-people-behind-the-bizarre-non) attempting to derail the bill.

But I think there&#39;s something more interesting here. This reads to me as a very clean deontology/consequentialism split. If it hadn&#39;t been the leases, it would have been the [supports for keeping nuclear plants open](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-03/machin-deal-tosses-30-billion-lifeline-to-us-nuclear-reactors). From one perspective, anything that helps fossil fuels in any way is absolutely forbidden, therefore, this is a bad idea; from the other, we [see that the policy bundle reduces 24 tons of emissions for every ton it adds](https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Modeling-the-Inflation-Reduction-Act-with-the-US-Energy-Policy-Simulator_August.pdf), so it&#39;s net good, period.

There&#39;s a persistent belief on the left that there&#39;s a vast disaffected left-wing mass of voters who would show up for a sufficiently inspiring candidate. This was shown to be false when Sanders ran in 2016 and again in 2020, but it&#39;s *sticky* because it&#39;s nice to believe that everyone&#39;s silently on your side. Similarly, this portion of the left has been very keen to believe that [we can crush fossil-fuel supply, and it&#39;ll only affect billionaires](https://twitter.com/KateAronoff/status/1089327906139054080). The political reality is, of course, different, in that people [*really hate* high energy prices](https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Presidential-Approval-and-Gas-Prices.pdf), which is how supply restrictions manifest themselves.

I want to emphasize, not everyone on the climate-hawk left is taking the deontological approach. But it&#39;s certainly *interesting* to see this split.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijmqb7h/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijl6gb9/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Is there a modern continuation or critique to Popper&#39;s &#34;Open Society and Its Ene</title><updated>2022-08-09T15:03:59Z</updated><author><name>escherofescher</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Is there a modern continuation or critique to Popper&#39;s &#34;Open Society and Its Enemies&#34;?

Besides offering amusing vignettes such as:

&amp;gt;The President’s loud complaint to John Kelly one day was typical: “You fucking generals, why can’t you be like the German generals?”

&amp;gt;“Which generals?” Kelly asked.

&amp;gt;“The German generals in World War II,” Trump responded.

&amp;gt;“You do know that they tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off?” Kelly said.

&amp;gt;But, of course, Trump did not know that. “No, no, no, they were totally loyal to him,” the President replied. In his version of history, the generals of the Third Reich had been completely subservient to Hitler; this was the model he wanted for his military. Kelly told Trump that there were no such American generals, but the President was determined to test the proposition.

and

&amp;gt;Milley had already spoken out publicly against the banning of transgender troops, which Trump was insisting on.

&amp;gt;“Mattis tells me you are weak on transgender,” Trump said.

&amp;gt;“No, I am not weak on transgender,” Milley replied. “I just don’t care who sleeps with who.”

the piece also raises all kinds of troubling questions on civil-military relations, the deep state and the extent to which elected officials (like Trump) can be constrained by unelected bureaucrats. According to it, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marc Milley led the &#34;Resistance&#34; (TM) inside the Pentagon:

&amp;gt;“Fuck that shit,” Milley told his staff. “I’ll just fight him.” The challenge, as he saw it, was to stop Trump from doing any more damage, while also acting in a way that was consistent with his obligation to carry out the orders of his Commander-in-Chief. Yet the Constitution offered no practical guide for a general faced with a rogue President. Never before since the position had been created, in 1949—or at least since Richard Nixon’s final days, in 1974—had a chairman of the Joint Chiefs encountered such a situation. “If they want to court-martial me, or put me in prison, have at it,” Milley told his staff. “But I will fight from the inside.”

The piece further outlines Milley&#39;s efforts to stymie any attempt by Trump to order the military to &#34;start an unnecessary war overseas&#34; or &#34;be used in the streets against the American people for the purpose of keeping Trump in power&#34;. In particular, it refers to discussions about attacking Iran:

&amp;gt;Miller’s behavior did not look intentional so much as unhelpful to Milley, as Trump kept asking for alternatives, including an attack inside Iran on its ballistic-weapons sites. Milley explained that this would be an illegal preëmptive act: “If you attack the mainland of Iran, you will be starting a war.” During another clash with Trump’s more militant advisers, when Trump was not present, Milley was even more explicit. “If we do what you’re saying,” he said, “we are all going to be tried as war criminals in The Hague.”

&amp;gt;Trump often seemed more bluster than bite, and the Pentagon brass still believed that he did not want an all-out war, yet he continued pushing for a missile strike on Iran even after that November meeting. If Trump said it once, Milley told his staff, he said it a thousand times. “The thing he was most worried about was Iran,” a senior Biden adviser who spoke with Milley recalled. “Milley had had the experience more than once of having to walk the President off the ledge when it came to retaliating.”

&amp;gt;The biggest fear was that Iran would provoke Trump, and, using an array of diplomatic and military channels, American officials warned the Iranians not to exploit the volatile domestic situation in the U.S. 

Seems quite shocking that American officials would engage in back-channel communications with the Iranians to frustrate their own commander-in-chief. The piece details other efforts by Milley to slow-walk Trump&#39;s orders and while the authors justify it by saying he considered them unlawful it seems more appropriate to say that he considered them ill-thought-through and disagreed with them. Which raises the question of whether he should&#39;ve resigned if he felt unable to carry out his duties due to differences of opinion with the president. But the piece explains that he considered resigning but instead chose to stay on the inside to &#34;fight back&#34; against the president. When presented in such a way, his behavior may be viewed troubling, bordering on insubordinate.

Another question raised is the role of the process. The article alleges that Trump ordered an immediate withdrawal from Afghanistan and Somalia without consulting the chairman of the joint chiefs. Milley refused to carry out the order and instead assembled like-minded advisors and went to the White House to convince Trump to walk it back. Are the POTUS&#39; orders legitimate because they come from the president or because they went through the institutionalized process of formulating them? Even though abstractly it&#39;s the former, in the real world it is the process that seems to legitimize the orders. This has interesting implications in all kinds of areas, from democratic governance (is it enough to disrupt the process as on Jan 6 to stop democracy from functioning?) to medical treatments (can we short-circuit the FDA approval process to bring drugs into use faster?).</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/iji0yyw/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijh7epp/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] This is an entry in the Collaborative Analysis of the Inflation Reduction Act, w</title><updated>2022-08-08T18:56:51Z</updated><author><name>Sorie_K</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">This is an entry in the Collaborative Analysis of the Inflation Reduction Act, where u/xablor, u/_netstack and I all picked a different section of the bill to drill into in depth. We’re posting everything as top levels here so everyone sees them, but later you can also see all of the fleshed out entries together at the bottom of [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative_analysis_of_the_inflation_reduction/). Thanks to u/xablor for coming up with the idea to do this and for setting up the whole collaborative analysis.  My section is taxes.

**PART 1—CORPORATE TAX REFORM**

The corporate tax in the Inflation Reduction Act announces a new tax of 15% on book income, so your earnings prior to taxes, deductions, etc.  Basically, if the 15% tax on book income is higher than what they a corporation owes on their normal taxes, then that corporation has to add the difference between the two amounts on their tax bill and pay the total sum.  The idea here is to target corporations which are paying little to no taxes because of loopholes.

However, this only applies to corporations that have had $1 billion in taxabale income (averaged across the previous three years, unless the company has existed for less than three years, then averaged across however long they have been around).  These corporations can almost be exempt if they are experiencing a change in ownership, or if they had a certain number of (as yet undetermined) consecutive years earning below $1 billion, or if the Secretary of the Treasury feels like it.  Taxes are also levied on global income, so as to account for base erosion, the process of shifting profits from your high tax home country to a subsidiary or parent in a low tax foreign country. This is similar-ish to the way Trump’s Base Erosion and Tax proposal implemented an alternative minimum tax on global income.

For a [critical perspective](https://taxfoundation.org/inflation-reduction-act/), the conservative Tax Foundation argues “The proposed 15 percent minimum tax on corporate book income is the most economically damaging provision in the bill, reducing GDP by 0.1 percent and costing about 23,000 jobs&#34;.  Another [article of theirs](https://taxfoundation.org/biden-corporate-income-tax-rate/) gives a good explanation of the problems of taxing book income.  There might be good reasons why taxable income is lower (or higher) than book income, because of depreciation of tangible investments, because of stock options, because of net operating losses being carried forward – all of which might actually be reasonable and shouldn’t be penalized. The Tax Foundation [offers a more specific breakdown](https://taxfoundation.org/book-minimum-tax-analysis/) of which industries would be affected the most.  Supposedly real estate is number one followed by minining, mostly because they make significant use of depreciation.

All of this makes sense but again, though, this is only a tax on (certain) corporations making over a billion dollars.  In other words, at its most inefficient this tax will only affect at most 135 of the over 6 million companies registered in the US.  Even if all of their caveats are correct, will the tax really have such wide-ranging distortionary affects for the whole economy when its targeted at such a tiny minority of extremely profitable companies?  Would those negative effects outweigh the $313 billion in new revenue and deficit reduction?

One reason to justify being a little nervous is that the liberal Tax Policy Center [is also skeptical](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/book-minimum-tax-may-discourage-investment-more-rate-hike) about taxing book income rather just raising the ordinary corporate tax for the same reasons. They also point out that while the tax would only hit 300 companies (double my findings but who’s counting), those companies account for about 60% of all capital so if the tax disincentivizes investment the effects could be large.

However, [they take issue](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/putting-jcts-score-inflation-reduction-act-context) with the Tax Foundation&#39;s broad analysis and projections of the IRA, arguing that their assessment fails to take into the ameliorative affects of other tax credits.  As for the corporate tax, the point to a substantial body of research indicating that now up to 60% of corporate profits are estimated to be “supernormal,” ie profits beyond what you would normally expect that are made possible by rent seeking, patents, specialized expertise, economies of scale, luck, etc. ([1](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/WP-116.pdf), [2](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.17310/ntj.2016.4.05), [3](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.17310/ntj.2013.1.09) \- note that the the sources here are the US Treasury ~~and researchers from the famously non-leftist U Chicago~~). As long as the new tax is lower than 100% of excess profit, it shouldn’t really impact investment and hiring, at least according to the [Congressional Research Service](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RL34229.pdf) and my understanding of mainstream thinking on the issue (it’s possible I totally misunderstand this).  Furthermore, they [point to growing evidence](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/rethinking-incidence-corporate-income-tax) that the corporate tax is more progressive than once thought, landing more on the capitalists than on the laborers.

The Tax Foundation seems to basically agree with this – they don’t use the most liberal estimates you can find but they assume that 75% of the burden will fall on capitalists and 25% on laborers.  Tax Policy Center counsels further that the “laborer” category still hides significant progressivity because significant research ([1](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/rethinking-corporate-income-tax-role-rent-sharing/full), [2](https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/slower-productivity-and-higher-inequality-are-they-related), [3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2586870), [4](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533003769204362)) shows that growing shares of profits are now shared as income with top managers and executives, who are still counted as laborers in this context.  The corollary is that the incidence of the corporate tax that lands on labor is still fairly progressive, landing the highest on these high earners.  For more specific numbers on how this affects the tax incidence you can check these sources ([1](https://ericohrn.sites.grinnell.edu/files/exec_comp/ohrn_tax_breaks_exec_comp_2021_2.pdf), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272721002139), [3](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/134/3/1343/5420483?redirectedFrom=fulltext), [4](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24598/w24598.pdf), [5](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/corporate-taxes-and-the-earnings-distribution-effects-of-the-domestic-production-activities-deduction.htm)):

&amp;gt;“A study by Eric Ohrn of Grinnell College shows that the five highest-paid executives at the studied firms reaped between 17 and 25 percent of some recent corporate income tax cuts – including changes in depreciation rules and subsidies for domestic production.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Economists at the Federal Reserve Board and the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation found the highest-paid 1 percent of employees reaped 40 percent of the benefits of a corporate tax cut. An additional 19 percent of the benefits of that tax cut went to the highest paid 2 percent to 10 percent of employees.”

After you adjust for executive compensation being counted in the labor category, and for them bearing a vastly disproportionate amount of labor tax incidence, it upturns the Tax Foundation’s assessment that this would “raise taxes on all brackets” and confines the hike to the upper end of the scale.

Where I think this leaves us is that there’s general agreement that a normal corporate tax raise would be preferable than a book income tax in terms of efficiency and distortion.  However, given that this will target a small number of firms receiving excess profits from rent seeking, it’s hard to say how much this will really impact investment and hiring, if at all, and the tax incidence is almost certain to be progressive and to be born mostly by capitalists and the C suite.

&amp;gt; Minecraft players have been up in arms about the new player reporting system since it was announced a month ago, but it was finally implemented as part of yesterday&#39;s 1.19.1 update. It allows players on both private and Mojang-hosted multiplayer servers to flag inappropriate messages in chat for review by Mojang investigators, potentially resulting in suspensions and bans for players that violate Minecraft&#39;s community guidelines even on self-hosted servers. Fans are worried that the system will result in player bans for messages taken out of context, and more broadly that it gives Microsoft too much power to dictate the content of discussions on its platform.

More details from Mojang (aka Microsoft) [here](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/7317376541197), or a more technical breakdown of an earlier implementation from the weekly builds [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20220630085634/https://blog.bithole.dev/mc-report.html).

For those unfamiliar with the game&#39;s online mode, Minecraft (way back in 2009) originally focused on privately-run servers, and while there&#39;s a subscription service for company-run Realms servers (starting in 2013, before the Microsoft buyout), and a small industry of third-party management tools, some [better](https://chs.gg/) and some worse, but either way, the majority of servers are effectively managed by non-Mojang and non-Microsoft employees.  People playing on such machines only interface directly with Microsoft services to login and to download updates (and, uh, for everything in Windows).

Most of these servers are _small_.  It&#39;s theoretically possible to run a &#39;large&#39; server or server cluster -- [HyPixel&#39;s count is famously high](https://hypixel.krashnz.com/) -- but this usually involves some combination of throwing obscene amounts of RAM at the problem, using an extremely customized version of the server, and/or [clustering approaches](https://velocitypowered.com/wiki).  For a single dedicated server machine or even mid-end cloud instance, it&#39;s very hard to scale past ~200 simultaneous users: modded environments tend to struggle badly in the [~100](https://twitter.com/CuriousCalamari/status/1535364691488395266) users range, and the most recent BlanketCon (a modder convention server focused on a higher-performance culture war split called Quilt that derived from the high-performance internal-frustration split called Fabric) [managed to get a workable server to 170 concurrent players](https://hackmd.io/@LemmaEOF/blanketcon-22-postmortem#Performance-Performance-Performance) by live-patching out stuff like Achievements.  Most servers more likely run 5-40 concurrent players, usually favoring the low end.

Running a server is balancing act beyond the technical aspects.  Even without mods or PvP, it&#39;s trivially easy for a bad actor to grief other players at least some of the time, and even well-meaning players can unintentionally create lag bombs or overflow NBT.  And people are people, for better or worse.  In turn, server operators are dictators by nature; there is little appeal past whoever controls the electrical bill or the file system, and it&#39;s historically be constrained to the sort of thing that involve the FBI.

Which runs into some complications, when you&#39;re talking about a game a) is at least somewhat marketed toward kids, b) [that supports chat and a nearly-unfettered voxel sandbox](https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg/status/604411327583375361), c) has or had prominent cultural trends toward [anti-censorship](https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/en).  Not _new_ problems -- kids wandering unobserved into the wrong IRC channel, PHPbb or USENET/BBC are stories nearly as old as the internet themselves, and [inspirations behind federal legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act) older than Java 1.2 -- but ones somewhat more prominent when the majority of the children in the country play the game.So there&#39;s [definitely](https://twitter.com/politicalmath/status/1391282599046238208) a [problem](https://twitter.com/mattcarriere/status/1391290583486922757) that this is [pointed](https://twitter.com/gigaherz/status/1553076537179660288) at solving, or at least helping solve.

But there are some tradeoffs.  There are some technical efforts built into the system to avoid or at least reduce manipulation, but ultimately this is a field where not just one client, but also the server and the other client may be in the hands of the enemy -- early attempts to manipulate it are [allegedly failed](https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1553077938639085568), but I&#39;m somewhat skeptical that it&#39;s totally bulletproof and the rapid release of a couple patches hasn&#39;t encouraged people.  Even with the system working perfectly at a mechanical and code level, there&#39;s also just a more fundamental problem when moderation runs into culture: &#34;&#34;Is Queer A Slur&#34; - the greatest thread in the history of forums, locked by a moderator after 12,239 pages of heated debate,&#34;.    There&#39;s also not a lot of trust of Microsoft, here.  The migration from Mojang to Microsoft accounts famously, in the modded community, [booted one Forge dev out for over four months](https://twitter.com/voxcpw/status/1489695958925463555).  Xbox&#39;s general moderation capabilities are not exactly held in high regard, either, and it&#39;s pretty easy to imagine that the typical server maintainer does a better job.

Worse, there&#39;s reason to think it may not stop at this particular limit.  The [ADL](https://www.adl.org/resources/report/breaking-building-blocks-hate-case-study-minecraft-servers) has a oft-linked study on Minecraft moderation on the largest server clusters, and somewhat interestingly there&#39;s not very much overlap between what it&#39;s worried about, and what the new reporting system focuses on.  That [glassbottommeg](https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg/status/604411327583375361) thread wondering how Minecraft hasn&#39;t resulted in a bunch of lawsuits?  It&#39;s also about content that isn&#39;t reportable, here.  The central example where a server op might be an abuser?  Possibly handled... if the victim realizes it, and reports something that&#39;s obvious enough.  It&#39;s not clear how well this fixes or even seriously slows the underlying motivations and concerns, in the long run, in short.

Worse, this handles the _difficult_ technical problems: while not a perfect solution to the questions of authenticity of messages only viewed by three untrusted parties, it&#39;s a good enough one for Microsoft to have shipped it.  Expanding this system to upload different data, or without user intervention, isn&#39;t as simple as a boolean tweak, but it&#39;s not deeply complicated.

That&#39;s not to say it _will_ go wrong, or go further.  I&#39;m hope I&#39;m just being paranoid, and outside a small number of cases for stuff that would otherwise end up involving the FBI we never hear about it again.  But that&#39;s a hope.

There&#39;s a temptation to label this by the normal Culture War assumptions, where _obviously_ Red Tribers would oppose the new system, and Blue Tribers would support it.  And you can find _some_ of that, whether genuine or primed by the coverage, and whether pogger-faced unverifiable claims on YouTube or hyperbolic comparisons to Gamergate (yes, really) on Discord.

But there&#39;s also people on the Quilt Discord, a place defined in no small part by its Culture War split from a different modloader, pondering about the ramifications when someone reports certain feelings about the international status of Hong Kong.  Or that, given the weaponization of concerns about child abuse applied to even the most of LGBT-related topics, that perhaps this is not a great tool to be passing to the XBox Live Moderation Staff.  Which isn&#39;t a _huge_ surprise; I&#39;ve posted before about tech censorship [aimed at VioletBlue](https://www.reddit.com/r/CultureWarRoundup/comments/b7ycv5/offtopic_and_loweffort_cw_thread_for_the_week_of/ejwyhxf/?context=999) who then used that [as examples of what should be aimed at her _opponents_](https://twitter.com/violetblue/status/1112878491588939776), but it&#39;s worth pointing out none-the-less.((And, on the other side, it&#39;s not like PoliticalMath is going to share VioletBlue&#39;s perspective on what is acceptable discussion matter [when young adults are in the room](https://twitter.com/politicalmath/status/1523840050122870789).  There are people with principles, but you&#39;d give Diogenes a run for his money looking for &#39;em.))

So... I dunno.

The deeper melancholy is more about the general case.  Minecraft hits particularly had because it&#39;s Microsoft&#39;s Mojang (2 billion served!) on one side and Your Personal Server (2/10 active players) on the other, but that isn&#39;t exactly unique.  Everyone knows that anything happening on Discord is between you, everyone else on the server, Discord Inc, and [the inevitable leaks](https://twitter.com/hradzka/status/1116502891689172993), but it&#39;s not like the motivations for Minecraft here will care that you&#39;re running your own RocketChat or Matrix instance; they&#39;re just smaller and haven&#39;t gotten the same attention.

For now.

It&#39;s not like this is new grounds in a framework where private or small-community utterances can end up sliced and diced by faceless team of reviewers by metrics you can&#39;t understand or contest.  It&#39;s not even particularly extreme as such goes.  But now it feels increasingly like the result people want, rather than some accidental end-point.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijh79rt/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijgvwjj/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Ukraine Update time: Shit&#39;s still pretty much the same as last week, no major mo</title><updated>2022-08-08T17:44:34Z</updated><author><name>dblackdrake</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Ukraine Update time: Shit&#39;s still pretty much the same as last week, no major movement. 

Ukraine continues to do really well with HIMARS shoot and scoot, but they are feeling that 227mm, and we (the US) are laggin with the 610mm ATACMS, apparently because it can reach pretty deep into Russia and we don&#39;t want to hear about Ukraine doing a little whoopsy and atomizing a square block of Kursk or something.

The pocket from before is getting worse and more secure at the same time, with lots and lots of dudes there now (unconfirmed reports of 25000 with one unchallenged route out and in); this is scary if you are  a troop and need to eat, but also means that Ukraine can&#39;t just muscle their way in, so ???

From the russian end:

A whole bunch of Russian command has been returned to the earth, and a bunch more were recently dismissed for being fucking idiots; this is causing some problems in the short run but might be good for them in the long run, these dudes were obviously not performing super well. It depends if they have anyone competent waiting in the wings who was being help back by office politics. 

Russia is not decreasing their tempo on missile attacks as people have predicted, but are ramping down their use of the good shit. Iskander  and kalibr attacks are down but still exceed rate of replacement, and attacks using soviet era missiles are way up, probably to retain a strategic stockpile of modern missiles incase anything does wrong/ they need them elsewhere.

Finally, Russians are playing a fun game where they park artillery near nuclear plants/ Shell near nuclear plants. This isn&#39;t world ending shit and it won&#39;t effect anyone outside the immediate radius of the plants (and probably not even them), but it is happening and it is like 50 degrees off from the plot of a shitty techno thriller, so that&#39;s exciting!</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijgvwjj/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijgttes/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] &#34;Cop faces&#34;: to what extent are facial features actually predictive of personali</title><updated>2022-08-08T17:31:35Z</updated><author><name>4bpp</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">&#34;Cop faces&#34;: to what extent are facial features actually predictive of personality? Do meaningful population substructures among, say, white Anglos exist that would correlate with something like authoritarian personality?

I keep circling back to a certain pattern I seem to see, where a person famous for authoritarian or &#34;meddlesome violent pro-social&#34; behaviour turns out to have a facial features that register as similar in some relevant way according to my visual system. The behaviour they exhibit is always a certain palpable glee in public criticism, punishment and humiliation of perceived rule-breakers, especially as such rules are widely agreed upon by society. The cleanest example is the proprietor of [krebsonsecurity](https://krebsonsecurity.com/about/), who is a security blogger who moonlights in investigating random Eastern European credit card flippers and botnet operators and publishes their flailing as they get caught and apologetic letters they seem to send to him personally from jail. Next exhibit is [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY1kMZp36IQSyNx_9h4mpCg), a Youtuber who started out in generic DIY tinkering but then pivoted to overengineered revenge plots against package thieves and online scammers. [Matthew Green](https://isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/) is a cryptographer recently in the news for attacking another cryptographer for suing the NIST for not releasing details on NSA meddling in the post-quantum cryptography standardisation process (so basically carrying water for the NSA), but he seems to be at the outer edges of the (visual) category to me. [John McCain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain) was a famous person whose face is closer to a central example, but I don&#39;t know enough about the man beyond him having being a seemingly very principled and rule-bound Republican. On top of that, I seem to see the average of these faces in an endless array of movie FBI agents and real-life US border control. 

Does anyone else see the commonalities there, or is it just me? How plausible is it for a pattern like this to exist, and how specific would it be? Am I just seeing something quite general like Moldbug&#39;s Optimates or the distinguishing features one of the tribes of Albion&#39;s Seed, whose ethos and appearance both are stark to me by virtue of being culturally foreign? Could it be a narrower (hitherto unidentified, but perhaps actually sufficiently endogamous to maintain itself) genetically identifiable subgroup (of Anglo-Americans) with distinct temperament, or could there perhaps even be an almost inextricable facial correlate of certain personality traits every time selection pops them out, in the same way in which canids get [domestication syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_syndrome)?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijgttes/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijghq0p/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] I play a game called Final Fantasy 14.

I&#39;ve been wanting to write a post about the latest expansion, Endwalker, but in the interests of avoiding spoilers I&#39;ve been keeping it off, but at the eight-month mark I feel safe enough to write about it. 

(Warning: this contains copious amounts of spoilers. If you have any desire to actually play the game, I&#39;d skip this post.) 

In the setting of the game, there exists a precursor civilization known as the Amaurotines (named after the titular city of Amaurot). The inhabitants specialize in the magic of creation: and not only that, their souls are so strong in the energy of aether that their capacity could be said to be godlike. 

Needless to say, a species of human beings that can create anything with a thought can be said to be firmly in the post-scarcity side of the civilization tree. 

But not only can they create material possessions, like clothing, but they can also create life. It is treated as a serious enough matter to be somewhat centralized. Concepts of life must be throughly audited and assessed by your peers before their publication to the population at large.

The lives of these people are endless and death is something they chose. When they have tired of life, they return themselves to the star by dissolving their constituent anther, and return to the planet seeking a new, unclouded perspective.  

And from the textual evidence, the society is both egalitarian and meritocratic. There is no material inequality, and the leadership is chosen by respect and ability. But being a precursor society, their downfall is already written into the story. What sort of cataclysm could cause this perfect society to be destroyed? 

The root cause, as the game suggests, is their society&#39;s indifference to death and their ignorance of suffering. Not that they are naive, or thoughtless, but the society as a whole lacks the ability to cope with such things. Having the ability to create life, they do not hold it in such religious sacredness as we might be accustomed to, not even their own. 

And in them, I see reflections of certain strands of rationalist thought. (Certainly, I would not mind living in Amaurot. But it is not a healthy society). It is not exactly the same, but the same ambivalence towards the human experience and a desire to transcend death and suffering is still there. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY) would sum up the position I feel discomfort for. It&#39;s hard to say why exactly I don&#39;t like it, but I&#39;ll try my best.

The stubborn refusal to accept death, I think, comes from a secular worldview devoid of spiritual comforts. If you truly believe that there is no afterlife you would want to live as long as possible! But I can&#39;t help but see those who hold on to hope of eternal uploaded robot-bodies as the highest form of delusion, even more so than the religiously-minded people they hold with contempt. 

So I can&#39;t help but think of them as coddled scions of a advanced society, much like the Amaurotians. Such utopic dreams of a world without suffering or loss can only be sustained in soap bubbles, in glistening morning dew. Those who seek worldly paradise to escape their own problems will invariably suffer the most.

It is admittedly based on my own observations, with my very biased samples, so please take it with a grain of salt.

As a woman from a south american country who migrated to a Nordic country, I had expectations about what it would be like to live in a more progressive society when it comes to gender roles. Nordic countries are well known for their advances in gender equality, with men and women playing very similar roles in parenting, the work environment, politics, and so on.

And I was not disappointed. To my experience, this is true. However it surprised me to find out there are aspects in which people seem to spontaneously segregate themselves with a strong gender bias, much more than in comparatively more sexist countries such as my homeland.

One of them is in the STEM work field. I have noticed an even lower percentage of women working in this area. And even among those who work in the field, there seems to be a tendency for them to work more in management and other &#34;people oriented&#34; roles instead of pure technical tasks. Similarly, nurses are in their vast majority women. Bus drivers, more mixed than in other countries. And so so on.

When I asked nordic people about the reasons of that phenomenon, many shared the same opinion. With a small pay gap between different work fields, more symmetrical parenting roles at home and similar work-life balance across industries, there is less of an incentive for people to seek jobs that will fit their financial aspirations or parenting schedules. And when people are more free to choose their careers based on their tastes, then the gender imbalance in some fields is just an organic manifestation of the biological vocational differences.

Now, it is hard for me to imagine that the implications of this hypothesis are true. Well, if you are to believe that the nordic gender/professional roles distribution is at least closer to the baseline biologically oriented distribution, then what cultural pressures are driving proportionally more developing countries women towards STEM? An overwhelming societal pressure to be well succeeded financially? Does not seem to be the case. And more developing countries men towards, say, nursing?

Maybe to understand this matter we should look at another social phenomenon. Again, something that I empirically observe and have no data to support. But I feel there is a strong gender segregation that starts much earlier, at school and familiar circles.

It is common to see groups of girls or boys in the street, hardly ever gender mixed. Even in kindergarten hangouts - a common view in nordic streets - isles of pink or blue little dots, no noticeable intersections.

I can&#39;t help comparing that to my own developing country middle class childhood. We were not struck by poverty, by all means. But let&#39;s say my parents had greater concerns than surrounding their little girl with pink and unicorns. My and my peers&#39; reality was wearing oversized hand-me-down clothes and toys from our elder siblings - more numerous than in most families nowadays.

What I observe in families here is more intensive parenting, both in techniques and financial resources. Parents shower their children with pink or blue, reinforcing visual differences. Leisure activities will more often be tailored to each child&#39;s tastes - or at least to what the parents believe their children will like, with a very strong gender bias. Fewer children per family will also mean less chances of having a sibling of the opposite sex. Even play dates will probably be more segregated as parents (unconsciously?) again stimulate same gender interactions.

All in all, I believe that in a similar way that poverty and lack of education drives gender segregation by imposing gender segregated responsibilities from a young age - such as imposition of house chores, different access to education, etc - so does excessively resourceful parenting - by manufacturing worlds of sweet princesses or brave cowboys that are but a reflection of the cultural concept that boys and girls are inherently different in their tastes.

This is not to claim there are no biological differences in men&#39;s and women&#39;s brains that, at least partially, explain some tendencies. There mostly likely are. However I do not believe that it is possible to say that scandinavian or any other &#34;egalitarian&#34; countries are closer to an environmental neutrality that allows these biological differences to be expressed into societal tendencies in a purely organic way. Nor do I claim that a - maybe impossible - gender neutrality in childhood would lead to better outcomes by any metric. But I believe this &#34;segregation by excessive resources&#34; phenomenon should be accounted for when studying gender inequality.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijfqhxx/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijf8o56/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Two random flight questions.

Since they always try to get more money out of you.

1.  Does anyone pay the $25-50 to get a more forward seat on a plane?  I was on a plane with no middle seat - 2 seats on each sides.  I can understand paying for not middle seat but whose shelling out cash for the same seat 10-15 rows closer to front.

2.  Also noticed a pop up to board early for like $22.  Who pays that?  Personally I generally board last to minimize time inside plane.

I&#39;m thinking the main step (which I am going to do) is just start writing more stuff. But tactical advice would be appreciated.

I think I specifically want to be a better writer in three areas:

1. Sharing personal stories. This writing will mostly be used to speak with friends and family. Possibly as a diary. Possibly as a dream journal (I have lots of weird dreams, and I think I should start mining some of them for story ideas).
2. Writing fictional stories. I use to write a story in the past. I maybe burned out, or just lost my passion. But at the time I didn&#39;t feel very skilled at it, I&#39;d like to be better if the passion ever takes me again.
3. Op-ed style writing. Things that can be posted as articles and shared online. I&#39;d like them to be interesting, engaging, factual, and hopefully convincing.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijeczy5/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ije6sxe/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] What your thoughts on Hacker news and arc technica.

I&#39;m reading Albert Ellis&#39; *Reason And Emotion In Psychotherapy*, at least for now. Not sure if I&#39;m interested enough, but he was a pioneer in cognitive therapies. So far he seems to have added a layer on top of behavioural conditioning, where the words that people use to &#34;self-indoctrinate&#34; themselves function as a reward/punishment mechanism. So even if you use Freudian analysis to reveal the roots of someone&#39;s problems, you still have to deal with the mechanism by which those problems are reinforced. He argues that these self-indoctrinating words often hide irrational premises, which, when noticed and challenged, leads to improvement.

To be honest, the simplicity of the model (I suppose it will get more complex) raises an eyebrow, but perhaps I&#39;ll learn something useful. It is true enough that kneading one&#39;s resentments like dough is a questionable use of time that often goes unchecked.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijcht7i/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijby81g/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Do you know of anything beyond peppers which gives short intense pain without an</title><updated>2022-08-07T17:05:40Z</updated><author><name>Difficult_Ad_3879</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Do you know of anything beyond peppers which gives short intense pain without any actual damage?

**What if we just banned advertising?**

With obvious certain exemptions for public service announcements and the like, but no advertising generally for commercial products was allowed. People would be able to seek out information on products and services (via catalogues, websites etc), but this cannot be integrated into media not explicitly meant for that purpose.

The US advertising industry alone is worth almost US$300 billion. That $300 billion has an opportunity cost - that is theoretically $300 billion of labor, resources etc that could be spent something else to benefit society as a whole. While advertising may generate economic value to an individual or a company competing against others, it doesn&#39;t generate *wealth* for the economy as a whole. Advertising isn&#39;t producing a good or service that materially benefits society. It may be the case that the advertising industry is a leech on the economy as a whole, sucking away productivity that could be better spent elsewhere.


Advertising has often been described as a Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma. Companies constantly spend more and more on marketing and advertising to keep ahead of their competition, and there maybe be a tipping point where the money spent on advertising exceeds gains and all parties would have been better off if no one spend money on advertising in the first place. Of course, one of the ways to solve the Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma is to have an external agent force compliance and avoid defection. In this case, the government. 

Of course, there are some counter arguments:

1. While advertising doesn&#39;t generate wealth itself, it can assist in generating wealth by making people want things (consumerism). When people want things, they will engage in economic activity to acquire said things. This extra economic activity is a net good, and (arguably) leads to innovation and invention. There is a quote I can&#39;t quite remember that exactly - &#34;Advertising is the lifeblood of the economy&#34;. The counter-counter argument to this is a consumerist economy is not a good thing in the first place, and people should be driven by their &#39;organic&#39; needs and wants rather than what advertising has told them they should want or need. i.e. standard anti-consumerism argument. Additionally, advertising might cause people to engaging in behavior that causes actual harm, with the most poignant example that pharmaceutical advertising may play significant role in the opioid crisis, overmedication of kids etc. The obesity epidemic being fueled by junk/fast food advertising might be another example.

2. Advertising provides a source of funding for industries and institutions that couldn&#39;t otherwise exist without it. Journalism, entertainment media, some forms of art, sports might be some examples of this, where a significant part of there revenue is generated from advertising that they couldn&#39;t exist without, and we think these things are a net good. The counter-counter argument is that many of those things can exist via alternative (or original!) revenue models (e.g. charging more for a newspaper, ticket sales), and in fact advertising has resulted in perverse incentives that have corrupted those industries and institutions, e.g. advertising in journalism has incentivized clickbait and outrage rather than investigative, &#39;real&#39; journalism, which causes harm to society, which is a net negative.

3. The advertising industry does provide a benefit by providing insights into human psychology and communication that has benefits for society elsewhere (the same way NASA/the space race provided inventions and innovations that could be adapted to benefit the public, but on a psychological level). The counter-counter argument is that this is hard to quantify, doesn&#39;t fully address the issue of opportunity cost, only lessens its impact, and it might actually be a net moral negative as it allows the powers that be to engage in social manipulation and engineering we don&#39;t like.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijblsnk/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijbl7th/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] This is probably suited better for the Wednesday thread but I&#39;ll post anyways be</title><updated>2022-08-07T15:36:30Z</updated><author><name>f3zinker</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">This is probably suited better for the Wednesday thread but I&#39;ll post anyways because its been bothering me a lot lately. 

Lately I have been getting a lot of disturbing imagery in my head. Randomly pop up and ruin my mood. Now the part worth noting here is that its not disturbing in the traditional sense; gore, etc.. But in a more metaphysical/psychological sense. To put it shortly similar to how the main character in Crime and Punishment felt. 

For example. Lets say I didn&#39;t treat a person the most kindly. Or lost my temper, or acted along those lines. The following weeks. I will get imagery of that person mutilated in a car accident. Or withering away in a hospital bed, or something of the sort. 

Now as far as the average person is concerned. I am quite calm and patient. I rarely ever lose my temper, or treat people badly, intentionally. So I really don&#39;t know why would my subconscious feel guilt or whatever else. Because I consciously hold myself to what I consider very high standards of interpersonal behavior. 

I have meditated on this and come to the conclusion that I will take the burden of being the most calm, the most patient and not bring any harm to anyone even if that means going through great discomfort myself. Not bring any further pain to the world. To rid myself of the &#34;evil spirit&#34; or pay any debt *metaphorical* debt I have.

But I really don&#39;t understand what could be the reason for this. I am not too fond on psychoanalysis, but I would be open to some bullshit story that at least explains away some of this.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijbl7th/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijbgebk/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] I visited every Scandinavian country last month and would go out to at least one</title><updated>2022-08-07T15:02:19Z</updated><author><name>zoink</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">I visited every Scandinavian country last month and would go out to at least one nice restaurant in each capital.

It&#39;s more wonky than DALL-E 2, noticeably «dumber» than something like Google Imagen or Parti when it comes to understanding composition or conceptual merging (likely because it doesn&#39;t contain a standalone text encoder model), lazier (in that it leans towards low-order [gluing-things-together](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005597086756122644/1005652508036845568/cat_with_bird_wings_-S_244964435_ts-1659836641_idx-0.png), [like Dall-e 2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32342550) but worse, and filter-like style transfer), with a number of unfortunate failure modes dictated by badly filtered dataset (cut-off heads because images cropped to square can have all the right tags!), and far inferior to Midjourney in out-of-the-box aesthetic quality.  
...But it is the most powerful model we can expect to be able to run on consumer hardware in the foreseeable future, **by far**; it will keep getting better (by upgrading from its naive classifier-free guidance, at least in forks); it will be adopted, adapted and finetuned by companies like Midjourney; and it doesn&#39;t engage in censorship (though Discord owners *will* bonk you for stuff they don&#39;t like; read Emad&#39;s announcements).   

And it&#39;s so, so very inhumanly broad (taking its stated size of like 5 GB into account), it keeps blowing my mind. It has a reasonably good knowledge of... well, everything, every bit of visual trash we&#39;ve put on the interwebs over the years, from Unreal Engine *interface* screenshots to Big Chungus and Gigachad memes to styles of particular digital era artists to dumb American celeb portraits and anime waifus; with a disappointingly strong bias towards normie interests, but also a stunning ability to reach coherence, even photorealism – not only is it broad, but it has straight up *memorized* a ton of stuff, to the point it discards less definite aspects (consider [&#34;painting by Edmund Blair Leighton of a beautiful barmaid in old silky clothes sitting on the floor, looking sad, detailed face, touching her clothes and her face, the interior of a medieval castle in the background, 4k oil on linen by Edmund Blair Leighton, highly detailed, soft lighting 8k resolution&#34;](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005595971306127470/1005639368322588863/painting_by_Edmund_Blair_Leighton_of_a_beautiful_barmaid_in_old_silky_clothes_sitting_on_the_floor_looking_sad_detailed_face_touching_her_clothes_and_her_-n_9_-S_2965080456_ts-1659833507_idx-0.png) or [HDRI of Nier Automata landscape, Unreal Engine, Artstation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005596415755554866/1005653583062106213/HDRI_of_Nier_Automata_landscape_Unreal_Engine_Artstation_-W_1024_-n_9_-S_3050328502_ts-1659836890_idx-0.png)). 

And it&#39;s *not* hopeless to keep playing around with prompt wording and arguments (particularly after finding [a nice seed](https://twitter.com/TomLikesRobots/status/1555466892759941122) – it is *unbelievably* obedient to the seed, consider these iterations [1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005626617982357614/1005655065383669811/Detailed_masterpiece_concept_art_of_Cyberpunk_Princess_Zelda_in_a_gritty_world_hyperdetailed_concept_art_by_Ross_Tran_and_Greg_Rutkowski_hig_-H_768_-C_3.0_-s_120_-S_4145381887_ts-1659837249_idx-0.png), [2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005626617982357614/1005655300302458990/Detailed_masterpiece_concept_art_of_Cyberpunk_Princess_Zelda_in_a_gritty_world_hyperdetailed_concept_art_by_Ross_Tran_and_Greg_Rutkowski_high_quali_-H_768_-C_6.0_-S_4145381887_ts-1659837306_idx-0.png), [3](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005626617982357614/1005655540506050681/Detailed_masterpiece_concept_art_of_Princess_Zelda_in_a_gritty_fantasy_world_hyperdetailed_concept_art_by_Ross_Tran_and_Greg_Rutkowski_high_quality_DnD_il_-H_768_-S_4145381887_ts-1659837364_idx-0.png)), because the search space is vast; you may well discover a stunning gem in the multidimensional sea of ugly machine nonsense.

Unlike Midjourney which can make up its own story out of any sequence of characters (usually by defaulting to the characteristic cyan-magenta-orange «pretty» palette, cute women and some blurry castles in the mountains, or to «abstract symmetries»), it seems to play better with maximalist prompting (i.e. specifying as many attributes as possible).

Let&#39;s define the denominator as how much it would cost you to either buy or rent in that school district for the duration of your child&#39;s schooling.

We will make a very very bold and impossible assumption that the parents have remote jobs and can work anywhere in the country and don&#39;t have family members or friends they care about for network effects.

I don&#39;t have specifics, but my strong suspicion is the top high schools would all be in the flyover country part of America vs somewhere like Scarsdale NY or Palo Alto. Main reason being that undergraduate colleges care about class rank as well as geographic diversity and it&#39;s much easier for an admissions officer to justify giving an offer to the only red headed trombone player with a 1600 SAT from Nebraska, vs the 20 they can find in Lowell high School in SF.

* A Navy civilian employee during the Kennedy administration filed a series of grievances against her supervisor. The resulting investigation, hearings, and appeals eventually generated nearly 5000 pages of documents, or enough to fill about two banker&#39;s boxes. After losing her final appeal, she then requested copies of all associated material and mailed said material to the White House, along with a letter addressed to JFK in which she asked the President to intercede on her behalf and over-rule the appeals board. Nothing I reviewed indicates whether or not JFK ever personally looked into the matter. May we all be so dedicated to the causes we hold dear.

* The DoD once bought 7-figures worth of locomotives for another country only to discover they were incompatible with that country&#39;s existing rail system.

* Two Admirals spent a month arguing whose department would pay for the installation of a $300 telephone system (roughly $2900 dollars today).

* In a DoD survival guide to [REDACTED], service personnel were advised against accepting a &#34;tribal virgin&#34; a friendly tribal chief might offer them, not for ethical reasons, but because a tribal warrior might challenge them to trial-by-combat.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij22sho/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij1vpdj/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Lex Fridman released a [5 hour long podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I84</title><updated>2022-08-05T13:35:35Z</updated><author><name>f3zinker</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">Lex Fridman released a [5 hour long podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I845O57ZSy4) with John Carmack (probably one of the best programmers ever).

_______________________________________

On a side-note I want to discuss a potential weakness/strength of rationalist discourse. 

At one point in this podcast Lex says &#34;maybe aliens will visit us sometime in the future and they will see almost everything is running on javascript&#34;. Basically wrapping &#34;at the rate things are going, its probable that everything will run on javascript eventually&#34; with a cute little story. 

I realized I would be much more impulsively skeptical if told the latter than the former. I want to know if anyone else would have this tendency as well. 

I mean wrapping ideas and concepts in stories is quite literally culture, but I think its something that should be done judiciously when the ideas are not as universally agreeable, the rationalists do have a habit of doing this a whole lot. And thinking in stories and wrapping your internal thought process in them might just make you more susceptible to bullshit.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij1vpdj/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij1o0b2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] [Old jokes](https://dynomight.net/old-jokes/)</title><updated>2022-08-05T12:35:03Z</updated><author><name>orthoxerox</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">[Old jokes](https://dynomight.net/old-jokes/)</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij1o0b2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij1nc57/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] So I found one of those rare, modern PC games I don&#39;t hate.

At first I was curious about, and then enthralled by Hardspace: Shipbreaker.  It&#39;s a game where you tear down derelict spacecraft for scrap.  Feels like peeling a very intricate onion, with lots of hazards that will burn, freeze, electrocute, crush or explode you.  But generally if you are careful and thoughtful, none of those things happen.  Well, generally.  Sometimes there is no avoiding an explosive decompression.

I &#34;beat&#34; that right before Xenoblade Chronicles 3 came out.  I&#39;m actually really appreciating the pacing of this one way more than XC2.  I swear it was what, 10 hours into the game they were still explaining core mechanics to you?  Now don&#39;t get me wrong.  XC3 is still throwing a new mechanic at me every play session.  But it just feels a bit more evenly paced?

Anyways, I&#39;ll probably have more thoughts as I go through it, but if you liked XC2 it&#39;s a strong recommend.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij1nc57/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij1hg9v/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] As I am continuing my long pursuit to learn all the obscurities of reinforcement</title><updated>2022-08-05T11:34:19Z</updated><author><name>Difficult_Ad_3879</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">As I am continuing my long pursuit to learn all the obscurities of reinforcement and punishment psychology,  here are a couple fun tidbits I’ve come across:

* The stimulus that signals the end of a punishment, or is even *more toward the end* of a punishment, takes on positive valence in flies, mice, and (debated) humans. Not just *within the context of punishment*, but outside the context too. If you zap a mouse for a couple minutes and toward the end of the zap you play a certain sound, the mouse will “like” this sound and approach it outside the context. This is a kind of relief learning, where we begin to desire things that are associated with relief. 

* It’s commonly understood that exposing yourself to a fearful thing will gradually erase the fear, however the duration in which you expose yourself is crucial. In experiments of mice and men, short and sporadic exposures to a conditioned fear without the accompanying fearful thing can actually *increase fear* more than no exposure. And unlike in reinforcement learning, spaced trials are inferior to massed trials (although spaced mass trials are best). This seems extremely under appreciated because it indicates that merely thinking about your fear in short durations will increase it, something that a lot of people do. For the extinction of a fear to occur, a sufficiently prolonged exposure is necessary (for humans 15+min), ideally in massed trails (15min repeatedly).</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij1hg9v/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij14qs2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Where can I find a list of American high schools by average SAT (or ACT) score?

(The background for this is I&#39;m looking to move in the next year and buy a house to raise my kids in.  I am not tied to any location for work; I care mostly about the education and the culture and the peers my kids will interact with.  When comparing schools and districts, there are lots of dimensions to compare, but most are subjective, difficult to measure, or difficult to compare across states.  SAT scores are cold hard facts that correlate to a lot of things I care about, but they&#39;re hard to find.  Niche.com, for instance, posts scores, but they&#39;re survey answer questions.)</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij14qs2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij137le/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] **Telegram chat status update**

Remember [that](https://t.me/quokkas_den)? It&#39;s still around, yes. Recently we got semi-recognition and a link in the subreddit&#39;s sidebar.

Refresher:

*Q: What is the point?*

Lower inhibition, lower effort conversations. While civility and order is maintained,  most of TheMotte rules do not apply. Why? Well, we do already have a place where they apply. Motte rules produce good discussions, but also constrain, so I thought there is value in  experimenting with something a little different. Chat format is a good fit for that - it has different architecture and features compared to a forum like this one. 

*Q: Is it private?*

Nope. At least don&#39;t treat it like it is - Telegram asks your phone number. Possible remedy for those of us unfortunate to live in places where this might be a concern - buy a burner phone, you might need it anyway. Or try to suppress the urge to speak blasphemies, I guess?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij137le/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij0qba8/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] &#34;The first step in escaping a prison is realizing you&#39;re in a prison.&#34;
