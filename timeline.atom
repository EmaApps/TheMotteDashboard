[&#34;BREAKING: Mark Zuckerberg tells Joe Rog</title><updated>2022-08-26T01:13:04Z</updated><author><name>SecureSignals</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Another week another FBI controversy?

[&#34;BREAKING: Mark Zuckerberg tells Joe Rogan that Facebook algorithmically censored the Hunter Biden laptop story for 7 days based on a general request from the FBI to restrict election misinformation.&#34;](https://twitter.com/minds/status/1562927481945980928?cxt=HHwWgICwsfOQ0bArAAAA)

Zuckerberg&#39;s exact words are somewhat ambiguous:

&amp;gt;The FBI, I think, basically came to us, some folks on our team and was like &#34;Hey, just so you know, like you should be on high alert. We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically there&#39;s about to be some kind of dump that&#39;s similar to that. So just be vigilant.&#34;

By my interpretation, Zuckerberg is implying that his team acted based on the request from the FBI. Perhaps the FBI will have plausible deniability to assert that this was a &#34;general request&#34; rather than a specific demand to spike this story. Twitter censorship was even more aggressive than Facebook&#39;s, so it would be interesting to know if Twitter received similar requests from the FBI and if any of this communication referred to this story in particular.

Is Zuckerberg mistakenly generating controversy by apparently blaming the FBI for Facebook&#39;s decision to censor the story in the runup to the election? Or is he just being honest in confessing the truth on Rogan&#39;s show? Zuckerberg has always shown more personal hesitancy to engage in censorship, although in the past he has [ultimately folded in the face of enormous pressure](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54509975). I think he knows this will create more controversy for the FBI and he&#39;s signaling that he does not want similar requests in future election cycles.

But as we&#39;ve discussed recently, Facebook&#39;s content policy is now run by [ex-CIA](https://mronline.org/2022/07/14/meet-the-ex-cia-agents-deciding-facebooks-content-policy/) so similar requests for the cooperation of Facebook&#39;s moderation team may not even become known to Zuckerberg himself.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilt8n0u/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilsrtci/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] How to not feel tired after lifting?

So, Finland continues to bask in foreign attention due to the [prime minister&#39;s party scandal](https://alakasa.substack.com/p/the-stupidest-day-in-finnish-politics), with PM Sanna Marin currently ranking higher in [Google Trends than Taylor Swift.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F12vzpszb7,%2Fm%2F0dl567)

Developments during the week:

\- People continue to analyze the Instagram videos of Marin dancing, finding some indications that there might, indeed, have been drug use, ie. some people can faintly be heard talking in Finnish drug lingo and so on. Nothing conclusive, and the police announce that [they don&#39;t suspect foul play](https://news.yahoo.com/finnish-police-not-action-against-095348944.html/) related to videos. [Marin took a drug test](https://yle.fi/news/3-12588465), but since it&#39;s an urine test and not a hair test, critics claim it proves nothing.

\- Some major other local discussions: why wasn&#39;t Marin [formally on holiday when partying](https://yle.fi/news/3-12583726)? what if the Russians had attacked while she was drunk, or if there had been a crisis equivalent to the [MS Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_MS_Estonia) ship disaster? (Note: Russia has actually sent most of the troops in the Northwestern area to Ukraine, and Finnish crisis laws are written in a way that would nevertheless enable reacting to crises even if she had actually been in complete blackout mode.) Are the celebrities that Marin partied with high-status enough? (They&#39;re basically Instagram influencers and pop stars, and 5-10 years younger than 36-year-old Marin)? Is it all just media effort to get clicks and try to demonstrate they&#39;re not going easy on Marin for being young and female and leftist?

\- Marin was also accused of cheating on her husband (and the father of her child) when a [video turned out](https://www.is.fi/politiikka/art-2000009015380.html) where she&#39;s dancing with a guy (actually locally quite famous actor/singer Olavi Uusivirta) who is totally trying to get his mack on. I wouldn&#39;t say the video shows her cheating, unless she and her husband have agreed the other party can&#39;t even dance with the opposite sex. At least as far as I&#39;ve interpreted it, she&#39;s not really responding to her attempts and (I would guess) gently tells him to stop trying at some point. When asked about this video, Marin said that she thought Uusivirta &#34;was trying to whisper her something&#34;, which is quite silly, but a friend of mine, when we talked about the scandal, said that she probably phrased it that way since if she had said &#34;Olavi Uusivirta was trying to lick my neck even though I said no&#34; it would probably have been a career-ender for him, rather than her.

\- It turns out that two of Marin&#39;s celeb friends took a picture of themselves kissing while topless at Marin&#39;s official residence in Kes√§ranta, ie. Finland&#39;s Downing Street 11. This was widely considered to be inappropiate due to the official status of the location, as well as due to the idea that there might have been state secrets in the apartment. (One columnist even compared it to January 6, lol. If you want evidence about the mental American colonization of European politics...) [Marin promptly apologized](https://yle.fi/news/3-12589779).

\- There&#39;s a ton of news about this in foreign media, which is a huge thing in Finland in itself, since Finland is a country of 5,5 million people and, as such countries often tend to do, is hugely interested in all the cases where it is mentioned outside of its own borders, as [this meme, for instance](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/400x/12412665.jpg), indicates. (I&#39;ve heard that New Zealanders, for instance, behave the same way). Foreign coverage, like [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/24/finlands-pm-is-a-young-woman-in-power-her-partying-is-the-total-opposite-of-disgrace?CMP=share_btn_fb), seems to range from &#34;look at this hot PM&#34; to &#34;is this a plot by Putin&#34; to &#34;haha, it turns out that Finns are stuffy and conservative for hating their PM for dancing&#34;. As I&#39;ve noted, the actual criticisms aren&#39;t really as much about dancing as about the possibility of drug use in her vicinity and about the crises.

\- [Marin gives a tearful address](https://yle.fi/news/3-12591456) in Social Democratic party meeting, saying &#34;I am a human being. In the midst of the crisis, I have been thinking about Ukraine and about all of you&#34; (the [rest of her speech was about Ukraine](https://yle.fi/news/3-12589250) and shows the hardening of opinions in Finland about Russia, it wasn&#39;t just a random statement).

I&#39;m guessing that if there&#39;s not something new and conclusive turning up, the scandal is going to start dying, but of course something new and conclusive might very well turn up. Finnish social medias have been abuzz with constant suggestions there&#39;s new videos moving on around, including one journalist claiming that a video in the &#34;Thor network&#34; showing drug use, but this turning out to be a prank.

Disclaimer: This is some &#34;armchair general&#34;-level thinking put into words.

When the war began, I was afraid American support would soon disappear, come any newsworthy crisis. But it&#39;s been 6 months and support seems as strong as ever, at least judging by the recent 3bn military transfer along with the number of blue-and-yellow emojis on twitter. For many reasons, I think this war is not only a great chance to beat back Russian expansionism, but also to bring Ukraine closer to the west, hence why this question is important for me.

So--why do Americans seem so eager to help Ukraine?

My take is that it&#39;s mainly because they&#39;re acting out values that we admire.

Zelensky, for one, didn&#39;t run away and has remained deeply engaged throughout the conflict. As have many Ukrainians, both men and women, who chose to either stay behind or go back after the initial exodus. But it&#39;s not just personal courage that&#39;s delivered to us via news reports that we admire--it&#39;s also the example of national unity.

It struck me how low of an opinion Americans have to Afghans and Iraqis. The boots on the ground critique has focused on how cowardly or lazy their soldiers are, but I think the bigger reason for American disdain for them is their complete lack of national allegiance.  Perhaps I&#39;m talking out of my ass, but these two societies don&#39;t exactly fit the definition of society because they&#39;re more like a loose collection of tribes. In that sense, what they did made absolute sense: why risk your life for a different tribe? But from an American, even a Western perspective, this looks like a complete lack of skin in the game, especially in view of the recent news pouring out of the country of what their women are now subject to what with the taliban in power. The unspoken question is: why didn&#39;t they fight to protect their society and their way of life? (Taking into account a handful of individuals who did the needful).

I think Americans will continue to support Ukraine for the near future, at least another year or two because the Ukrainians are behaving in ways that Americans, irrespective of political leanings, can admire.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilq5bo5/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilpc6ix/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] If you were in the US, and you wanted to get semaglutide even though your health</title><updated>2022-08-25T07:01:10Z</updated><author><name>Flapling</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">If you were in the US, and you wanted to get semaglutide even though your health insurance won&#39;t cover it because you&#39;re not quite obese enough, how would you go about it?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilpc6ix/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/iloo9nm/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] What&#39;s a way that an intelligent person can make a &#34;part-time minimum-wage job&#34; </title><updated>2022-08-25T02:55:17Z</updated><author><name>Rowan93</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">What&#39;s a way that an intelligent person can make a &#34;part-time minimum-wage job&#34; tier income, that isn&#39;t the obvious one?

Well, the other obvious one is to get a better job, so to clarify why it&#39;s even a problem: I&#39;m basically a NEET right now, have been for like 6 years, failed to complete my undergraduate (physics) degree, never been employed.

I&#39;m sure there are a variety of factors contributing here, but one that I think is probably a relevant is that violent crime is [disproportionately](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/revcoa18.pdf) committed by black people, so focusing on arresting violent offenders would necessarily result in disproportionately arresting black people. Or perhaps that black people received longer sentences under the current government 
 in the event that violent offenders tend to get longer sentences.  No one lobbying for the progressive, or perhaps even black, vote wants to be the focus of a headline saying that arrests of black people increased under their leadership. Conversations surrounding equity are simply not nuanced enough for the politician to be able to counter that there&#39;s more to it than those statistics, that it&#39;s just because they focused more on violent crime so people who commit violent crime were arrested at higher rates. And this could also explain why violent crime rates have gone up more in blue cities on a per capita basis. 

I just wanna say, I hate to be the guy to bring this point up. I&#39;m not just out here looking to take jabs like this, so if there is anything I&#39;m missing, definitely let me know.

My ultimate point is that I have to imagine politicians on the left looking for votes are not unaware of this reasoning.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/iln9sr0/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilmyik2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] I recently interviewed [Adam Mastroianni](https://twitter.com/a_m_mastroianni) o</title><updated>2022-08-24T19:50:31Z</updated><author><name>Pongalh</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">I recently interviewed [Adam Mastroianni](https://twitter.com/a_m_mastroianni) of Columbia University  - and sometimes comedian, I was surprised to discover - on a variety of subjects. I&#39;ve broken it up into two easily digestible chunks.   


[Part 1](https://youtu.be/M409oKluPYc) mostly goes into the nexus between psychology and econ/business. If you were pursuing behavioral econ, is that better accomplished in an econ department or psych department? Neither, try business school. The downside of general news consumption, as opposed to hobby or industry-specific news, is also covered.  


[Part 2](https://youtu.be/kQOBYOlQ_Jg) goes into pop culture consolidation, i.e. the endless reboots and franchise sequels/spinoffs. (This appears to be true even of video games and books.) There is some discussion of methodology, i.e. is a Nintendo game that features Mario at all part of the Super Mario Bros. Video Game Universe? Oligopoly in general is also touched on.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilmyik2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilmxnyb/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] I&#39;m on the autism spectrum and want to become as graceful as the average neuroty</title><updated>2022-08-24T19:45:15Z</updated><author><name>SkookumTree</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">I&#39;m on the autism spectrum and want to become as graceful as the average neurotypical. I understand that this might be a nearly impossible task; there are neurotypicals out there that almost never make social blunders...and this is not far from average, in my view. I&#39;ve been practicing lots, and have made some new friends...but I still get the feeling that they are basically secretly annoyed by me and only tolerating me out of a sense of pity and politeness. How might I get to the place where I think the average neurotypical is: seemingly effortlessly graceful, never making a mistake big enough to be put into words while sober. Watching two average people talk, to me, is like watching Olympic gymnasts or professional ballerinas. My therapist has been helpful - but she hasn&#39;t given me much that would help me get that level of grace.

Also: I find it interesting that people expect me, at 27, to have had some relationship history even though I am shorter than average and not that good looking - as well as being awkward. I wonder if they expect me to have, at least at some point, have bitten the bullet and been in a relationship with someone who I wasn&#39;t all that interested in or who had very real shortcomings that impacted them every day...maybe they were 300 pounds overweight. Maybe they had a drug or alcohol problem. Maybe they were no shit crazy and wound up in mental hospitals twice a year. IDK what it is. Is there any way that I could figure out how to accept being a nurse and caretaker to someone that is more or less disgusted by me? I&#39;d like to have a family, and if that is what it takes I&#39;d consider it, but it is a hard pill to swallow - being a single father, functionally, while also being a nurse and caretaker for a wife that is committing slow suicide. That takes toughness and discipline.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilmxnyb/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilmfcp2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] It blows my mind how thoroughly Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign has been forgotten.

What I mean is that Trump effectively ran on a single issue in 2016: immigration. He was going to ‚Äúbuild the wall and deport them all.‚Äù That‚Äôs why he was elected, not because of ‚Äúwokeness,‚Äù or ‚Äúliberal elites,‚Äù or to end foreign wars or whatever. 

And yet that‚Äôs been almost entirely forgotten in the years since. Trump‚Äôs presidency was a resounding failure on the anti-immigration front, so maybe that‚Äôs why. 

But for whatever reason, today immigration has fallen almost completely by the wayside compared to 2016. On both sides. The daily ‚ÄúTrump bad‚Äù pieces in the media are rarely about immigrants anymore, they‚Äôre about Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúerosion of democratic norms‚Äù or SCOTUS or whatever. The right on the other hand has been completely consumed by drag queen story hour, abortion, woke Disney and a dozen other stupid non-issues that don‚Äôt even rate in comparison to mass immigration. 

It really is incredible. Nobody cared about Trump, the man. They shouldn‚Äôt have, anyways. There wasn‚Äôt, and isn‚Äôt, anything impressive anything about him. There was a little novelty value at the beginning but it wore off pretty quick. The only reason he got anywhere was he spoke to something no other politician had the courage to: the wide-spread but socially unacceptable fears of demographic replacement among white Americans. 

(Incidentally, everyone recognized this across the political spectrum, except for neocon DR3 types. Well, they recognized it, too, they just pretended otherwise).

This is what had everybody in a tizzy in 2016, right and left. This is what made left-wingers fear turbo-Hitler, and what made right-wingers think, ‚Äúhey, maybe we can actually get somewhere with this guy.‚Äù 

Unfortunately, most people are hopeless morons so this somehow managed to turn into a Trump cult wherein millions of brain-dead right-wing Americans worship a fat old real estate mogul as if he were a god and their millions of brain-dead left-wing counterparts revile him like a demon, with an almost complete disregard on both sides for the actual original source of his popularity. 

I‚Äôm not sure what point I‚Äôm actually making here. Maybe that when ‚Äúdid that TEACHER with BLUE HAIR just say her pronouns are THEY/THEM?‚Äù is considered by ‚Äòconservatives‚Äô as big (or bigger!) an issue than millions of immigrants entering the country every year and demographic replacement continuing apace with no sign of abatement, it well and truly is Over.

When I was a kid and would get to stay home sick from school, I&#39;d always play video games. My mom wouldn&#39;t let me stay home unless I was actually pretty sick, but if I did, then I&#39;d usually get to play for a while. Now I have this association with being sick and playing video games.

So I&#39;m finding myself at home, sick, trying to find a game to play. But, I can&#39;t really even manufacture an interest for games anymore. Even after looking through a bunch of reviews, reddit threads, etc. I want to want to play something, but I can&#39;t conjure it at all.

Idk, has anyone else noticed a similar decline in interest in gaming over the years? I never thought I&#39;d get old and stop playing games. But, here we are, and I&#39;m only 30.

&amp;gt;Biden‚Äôs decision to move ahead with $10,000 in student debt cancellation for borrowers who earn under $125,000 will cost the federal government around $244 billion, Kantrowitz estimated. The $20,000 in relief for Pell Grant recipients may add around another $120 billion to the government‚Äôs costs.

&amp;gt;The unprecedented action by the White House of wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer debt follows years of advocacy pressure and recent months of heated debate among Biden administration officials.

From what I have read, such figures are slightly misleading. This seems like a lot, but it&#39;s much less because it&#39;s not like the government was ever going to collect on all of that $300+ billion. It&#39;s not like owing $1+ trillion to a creditor, the service has already been rendered. This is also why Democrats seem to have more success at  a policy-wide level compared to Republicans. Biden has delivered more for his voters than Trump did.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilme8dx/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilmasea/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] What&#39;s the best source for looking up nutritional information (mostly calories) </title><updated>2022-08-24T17:21:24Z</updated><author><name>LoreSnacks</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">What&#39;s the best source for looking up nutritional information (mostly calories) on non-prepared food ingredients?

I&#39;ve done one in July &amp;amp; August so far. I charge a small fee for coffee &amp;amp; pastries ($10), and a local nonprofit is shouldering most of the financial load in paying for advertising. (mailing postcards to registered businesses within the ZIP code) Tonight, I&#39;ll be working with a local marketer to start scriptwriting for online video content.

Results are mixed. Less than 10 people are showing up right now, but 3 are returning ticket buyers. Also, I&#39;ve had people on city council show up. An acquaintance also wants to shadow me next month to set up a similar service across the other side of the city.

So now I&#39;ve got to figure out how to keep pushing through the growth stage.  Current marketing (I&#39;m told) costs $500/mo, which is not sustainable. The 501c3 has told me I cannot operate as a business if I&#39;m to continue enjoying their support. It is possible to set up as a nonprofit with various designations (501c3, 501c4, 501c6) but I have to educate myself on the pros and cons of each of these. 

The biggest con for now: I am used to making executive decisions by myself, and I don&#39;t feel get warm fuzzies about forming a board.

**The ease of orthodoxy**

A few weeks ago I came across a Paul Graham essay I had missed when it first came out: http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html

The whole thing is good but I want to highlight this paragraph and footnote:

&amp;gt; To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the features of a religion. In particular it must have **strict and arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their purity by obeying**, and its adherents must believe that **anyone who obeys these rules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn&#39;t**. 

&amp;gt; The superficial demands of orthodoxy make it an inexpensive substitute for virtue. And that in turn is **one of the reasons orthodoxy is so attractive to bad people. You could be a horrible person, and yet as long as you&#39;re orthodox, you&#39;re better than everyone who isn&#39;t**.

That explains a whole lot. There are people who are held inline just by fear of crossing the orthodoxy, but even normal people enjoy the thrill of moral superiority.

And then there are the people who behave legitimately horribly but skate by by shouting orthofoxy. It is my default assumption for [mal](https://i.imgur.com/gcRoCAm.png)e [feminist](https://www.vulture.com/article/joss-whedon-allegations.html)s who are banking up brownie points because they know they are going to need them. They have karma and they intend to spend it.

So lo and behold when this week we get a perfect example, [Dan Price](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/technology/dan-price-resign-social-media.html). ([Archive link for NYT](https://archive.ph/TDCP5))

**You can count on journalists to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other options**

You remember Dan Price. If not by the name, then as the guy who took a big pay cut from his $1.1 million salary to set a minimum wage of $70,000 for employees at his company, Gravity Payments. He did this because he found it unfair to get paid so much. He got a huge amount of publicity from all the usual sources, doing appearances on the *Daily Show* and similar puffery. Rush Limbaugh, on the other hand, called him a socialist, which if Price was scripting this would be exactly what he would have asked for.

Then-at-Bloomberg reporter Karen Weise found out really quick [that there was a lot underneath the surface](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-gravity-ceo-dan-price/). ([Archive link for Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/v0wdA)). Price&#39;s brother sued him after the announcement because the brother was so mad about the wage increase, do you remember? Seattle Times and Inc magazine sure do.

As background, Price claimed his prior salary of $1.1 milion was set by market rates, but just compared to similar businesses and revenues, you would expect something closer to what was a third of his prior salary, so he was not giving up much. When Weise asked him about that in an interview, he changed the subject and ended the interview.

Well, the reality is that his brother Lucas served him with a lawsuit claiming he was being overpaid. And *then* two weeks later Price docked his own pay. To what level? I have not been able to figure that out, but it could have been &#34;slashed&#34; from 3x market rate to 2x market rate.

When confronted with this:

&amp;gt; In a follow-up interview in mid-November, I pressed Price about the inconsistency. How could what he told me about being served two weeks after announcing the raise be true when the court records indicated otherwise?

&amp;gt; ‚ÄúUmm, I‚Äôm not, I have to look,‚Äù he said.

&amp;gt; The court document, I said, definitely says March 16.

&amp;gt; ‚ÄúI am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise,‚Äù he replied.

&amp;gt; ‚ÄúThe court record shows you being served on March 16‚Äâ...‚Äâat 1:25 p.m.,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd actually, your answer to it was dated April 3,‚Äù also before the pay hike.

&amp;gt; ‚ÄúI am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise,‚Äù he repeated.

&amp;gt; I asked again how that could be, saying the declaration of service shows Price was served with the complaint, the summons, and other documents, ‚Äúthat you are a male, who is white, age 30, 5-feet-8-inches, medium height, dark hair.‚Äù

&amp;gt; He paused for 20 seconds. ‚ÄúAre you there?‚Äù he asked, then twice repeated his statement that he was only aware of the suit being initiated in late April. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be happy to answer any other questions you may have,‚Äù he added.

What else could conme out? His ex-wife who did a TedX talk at the University of Kentucky where she read from her journal entries from the time she was married. ‚ÄúHe got mad at me for ignoring him and grabbed me and shook me again.‚Äù ... ‚ÄúHe also threw me to the ground and got on top of me. He started punching me in the stomach and slapped me across the face. I was shaking so bad.‚Äù


**&#34;What are you going to do, cancel me?&#34; - Man who was cancelled**

Weise relayed these quotes to Price, who said he was not comfortable responding when he had no evidence of such an allegation. He called back three hours later to remember to say that the events never happend.

Weise published her article and everyone who loved being in the room with him ran for the exits. Someone had called the emperor naked, and suddenly there were other things to do.

Taking a page from Bill Clinton, Price told his staff that his ex-wife was nuts and needed to be restrained, but admitted he should not have done that. A year later his staff spontaneously gifted him with a new Tesla because they loved him so much, which was another media set up according to his head of marketing, another employee in marketing, and the young woman who had at the time claimed credit for coming up with the idea. Price gives this recitation of facts the Sharper Image  how-dare-you-say-our-product-is-fake-when-this-hurts-the-feelings-of-our-customers-who-did-not-know-that treatment: ‚Äúthe idea that some people are trying to soil this cherished memory is deeply hurtful.‚Äù He was quickly forgotten again.

**Just tweet through it**

But Price was determined to get his spotlight back. He set out on a new quest to uncancel himself and hired an ex-Seattle Times reporter to shit out orthodoxy 24/7/365 on all social media channels.

He got back into the spotlight. Nick Kristof&#39;s NYT wrote [a lauditory opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/opinion/sunday/dan-price-minimum-wage.html) ([archive link for NYT](https://archive.ph/c5WU1)). Did it contain anything negative at all? Yes, it admitted there were &#34;bumps.&#34; Kristof links to the NYT&#39;s old story from when the narrative was that Lucas&#39;s lawsuit was in response to the pay policy. Kristof does not correct that narrative but knows better than to repeat it since it has been proven false by court records.

&amp;gt; There were bumps, no doubt about it. A couple of important employees quit, apparently feeling less valued when new hires were close to them in pay. The publicity forced Gravity, which processes credit card payments for small businesses, to hire additional people to handle a deluge of inquiries. Worst of all, Price‚Äôs brother, who owned a stake in the company, sued and alleged that Price hadn‚Äôt consulted him on decisions.

Nothing there is literally incorrect! Publish it! We are in the height of #MeToo but no need to publish accusations from his ex-wife TedX talk.

Oh, the ex-wife&#39;s TedX talk? Gravity&#39;s head of marketing called the University of Kentucky about &#34;potential defamation lawsuit&#34; and the university declined to publish it. This was known back in 2016 but no need to bring that up in a 2019 piece. Definitely nothing #MeToo relevant here, nosiree.

**You can count on journalists to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other options and then forgotten the previous narrative and then once again exhausted all other options**

So Karen Weise writes a new article at NYT (the first link). And it turns out that he has been building up his SEO as the standard male feminist to lure in women. Doug Forbesm, a blogger, had been collecting accounts of women accusing Price for years. No one, including the NYT, wanted to run the story so he blogged them himself. Besides his ex-wife we have:

* Serena Jowers filmed them having sex without her knowledge and three other women say he did the same to them.

* Another described Price having sex without her consent in the middle of the night.

* In a car ride, Shelby Hayne said he grabbed her throat and would not let go, and then drove donuts around a parking lot when he realized he was not getting any.

* Danny Askini said he pushed her against a wall when he did not invite her upstairs after a date.

* Kacie Margis did not know there were any warning signs because they did not come up in Google searches, and ended up in Palm Springs with him. She says she got locked out of their room while wearing a bikini, and later he had sex with her while she was asleep after taking an edible.

The Hayne incident ended up being investigated by the cops, which is what broke the dam and let everything else finally come out. 

He resigned as CEO so he could devote his energy full time to fighting the false accusations against him. As Karen Weise is writing this article, you can tell she loves rubbing it in the face of media, including the NYT that she is currently writing the article for. And she fucking loves juxtaposing Price&#39;s orthodox social media posts with his actual behvavior. Particularly his posts about how easy it is for a man to disprove false allegations. (-Õ°¬∞-Õú ñ-Õ°¬∞)‚òû

Current web searches are all about articles of his resignation so there may not be a third act for him.

The assault charge got dropped from the Hayne incident, but the cops had a gem they documented:

&amp;gt; According to the police report, Mr. Price boasted that no one had believed Ms. Col√≥n‚Äôs allegations of abuse ‚Äúbecause of who he is and that no one would believe her either.‚Äù

After all, what use is all that cred as a male feminist if you cannot spend it?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilm1fkk/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/illtpd0/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] What are some &#34;low-hanging fruit&#34;-type cybersecurity certifications that a non-c</title><updated>2022-08-24T15:34:10Z</updated><author><name>thisismymilitaryalt</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">What are some &#34;low-hanging fruit&#34;-type cybersecurity certifications that a non-coder could pick up relatively easily?

Bruen) to challenge New York&#39;s tweaked concealed carry license regime.

A primer for the case is [here](https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/2022/08/litigation-highlight-antonyuk-v-bruen/).

Plaintiff has moved for a preliminary injunction, and the state&#39;s response is [here](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nynd.133602/gov.uscourts.nynd.133602.19.0.pdf).

Time will tell how the court case is going, but this is culture war! From the primer:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

&amp;gt;New York‚Äôs reliance on Founding-era laws that sought to disarm disfavored groups such as Native Americans and religious minorities is sure to garner attention. But, of course, this isn‚Äôt a novel idea.  In a dissent from the Seventh Circuit‚Äôs 2019 decision in Kanter v. Barr, then-Judge Amy Coney Barrett posited that the U.S. historical tradition of gun regulation‚Äîincluding laws disarming ‚Äú\[s\]laves and Native Americans,‚Äù although obviously unconstitutional today‚Äîsupports laws ‚Äúbased on present-day judgments about categories of people whose possession of guns would endanger the public safety‚Äù (such as, potentially, those who have posted online about a desire to commit violent acts).

So what is this referring to? In the response, the state leans on this argument:

&amp;gt;2. New York‚Äôs Good Moral Character Requirement Is Relevantly Similar To A Long Tradition Of Anglo-American History And Doctrine  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;New York‚Äôs good moral character requirement is consistent with the long history in both England and America of disarming those whose *associations, reputation,* or conduct suggested they posed a danger to others or to the public order...

Italics mine

&amp;gt;From the early days of English settlement in America, the colonies sought to prevent Native American tribes from acquiring firearms, passing laws forbidding the sale and trading of arms to Indigenous people....  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;even after the English Bill of Rights established a right of the people to arm themselves, the right was only given to Protestants, based on a continued belief that Catholics were likely to engage in conduct that would harm themselves or others and upset the peace...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Virginia followed this example, passing an act in 1756 that ordered the disarmament of all Catholics or ‚Äúreputed Papists‚Äù who refused to take an oath of loyalty to the colonial government. An Act for Disarming Papists, and Reputed Papisits \[sic\], Refusing to Take the Oaths to the Government (1756)

While all of this may be good law practice, it&#39;s red meat for the war.

Awaiting future pain.

While I was there, I overhead a not-really private discussion between the nurses about the [removal of 377A](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-62545577). Some of them defended the decision to protect the definition of marriage (&#34;the religious feel threatened&#34;), others decried the move as useless because of it. But overall, none of them were interested in actually defending 377A directly. 

I&#39;m reminded of this passage from [_Neutral vs. Conservative_](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/01/neutral-vs-conservative-the-eternal-struggle/)

&amp;gt; In the hospital where I work, there‚Äôs a RESIST TRUMP poster on the bulletin board in our break room. I don‚Äôt know who put it there, but I know that anybody who demanded that it be taken down would be tarred as a troublemaker, and anyone who tried to put a SUPPORT TRUMP poster up next to it would be lectured about how politics are inappropriate at work. This is true even though I think at least a third of my colleagues are Trump supporters.

Why do I post this in the Wellness Wednesday thread? Well...

A few months back, I was really bummed out by observations like these. Like the Communist that seethes at perceived edifices to captialism all around him, I could not help but observe the prevailing attitude of mild cultural liberalism around me, and it brought me a significant amount of distress to think about my observations (which is to say, I upset myself daily). 

Today, I realise I&#39;m no longer upset by the observations I make, even though I still believe in the baseline conclusion that society is fundamentally biased. Above all else, I no longer despair, I no longer feel blackpilled, and I think this is because I plan to actually **do things** to change the world. An obvious lesson for the depressed among us: Make plans, get organised, and above all else -- try. The work of struggle, whether consequentially productive or not, will make you happier for the moment.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilkt0k3/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilkpsob/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] **What are non-Trumpists supposed to do about The Lie?**

By The Lie I mean the idea that the 2020 election was stolen. 

What are non-Trumpists supposed to do about the fact that the former President continues to push The Lie? Given that the idea that the election was stolen is both false and obviously false - which, let us be clear, both of those claims are clearly the case - what are those of us who can observe and accept reality supposed to do about the large portion of the population who can or will not? The ones who either have actually been fooled and genuinely believe The Lie, or else who are simply lying to themselves when they say they think that Trump genuinely won the election? 

From my perspective, there is not a good, democratic, peaceful resolution to this. Perhaps during the month or two following the election there was the (quite implausible) possibility that someone could genuinely believe the election actually was stolen, and we really could convince them with evidence. But at this point, it seems quite clear that the election was carried out well within the norms of how all elections in the USA are carried out. 

So what do we do about the people who continue to insist on maintaining The Lie? Given the failure of the soap box and the ballot box, at what point do we resort to other boxes? It seems quite plausible to me that anyone who continues to claim that the 2020 election was stolen is unlikely to accept the results of any other election going forward - once you reject one legitimate election, why not reject them all? And given the correlation between such and gun ownership, it seems very likely that such will result in violence, like it (attempted to) on Jan 6. What should the rest of us, who still desire for the democratic process to work and for the transfer of power to be as peaceful as possible, do about this?

I genuinely have no idea. All I know is &#34;oh don&#39;t worry, Republicans actually do believe in democratic values and care about the peaceful transfer of power&#34; has been demontrated to be a clear and obvious lie, and so we must not proceed as though it were true</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilkpsob/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/iljthrd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Anthony Fauci has announced his retirement.

Lots of articles gave glowing praise of a man I&#39;ve come to dislike. Which might seem mild, but I normally can&#39;t muster more than apathy for most politicians or bureaucrats. [This article](https://www.aier.org/article/goodbye-anthony-fauci/) captured a bit of what I dislike about him. A career bureaucrat most of his life. His handling of the AIDS crisis was unimpressive, and his handling of covid felt downright criminal.

I do hope there is some kind of come-uppance for this whole thing. Even if the only consequence he suffers is a public shaming, I&#39;d rather have that than just have him quietly get ignored. I doubt any of that will happen.

I do have wishlist coming out of the pandemic. The &#34;wish&#34; part in wishlist is very important here:

1. Accountability for top level bureaucrats. Politicians face elections, which is barely a form of a accountability, but at least it is something. Top level bureaucrats that control agencies should face some form of accountability. The heads of the CIA, FBI, and DOD should all have been torn a new asshole after 9/11. The head of the CDC should face congress after every disease outbreak. The head of the FDA should face congress for every bad drug, ***and*** every delayed good drug. Etc etc.
2. Accountability for dangerous forms of research. Gain of function research *might* not have caused covid. But there is way too much uncertainty. And it certainly did nothing to *prevent* covid. That is the whole point of GoF research, right? Slash the funding to nothing. At worst they were actively harmful, and at best they were completely useless.
3. Acknowledge how dystopian things can get without hard protections in favor of individual rights.

We have a dev site at https://www.dev.themotte.org/. I strongly encourage you to make an account and test stuff out. Change settings, try to break it, make sure it works how you&#39;d expect it to. Can you find problems? Please find problems! Report them here, or at the, uh, dammit, I don&#39;t trust Reddit to not filter this. Report them at the repo on https://github.com/themotte that says it&#39;s for the website. If they&#39;re sensitive for some reason, feel free to PM me.

The standard posting rules do apply, with the major exception of the low-effort rule. Low-effort posts are still disallowed, but no-effort posts are explicitly allowed! Post Lorem Ipsum! Post the bee movie script! Write &#34;I am a fish&#34; 400 times! Go wild! Obviously this is a dev-site-only change, this is just to make it easier to test stuff.

If you want to join the dev team, [it&#39;s over here](https://discord.gg/KChpcdaNJC). I cannot emphasize this enough: *this would not be happening if it wasn&#39;t for our volunteers*. They are great. I seriously need to put a Credits page on the site, I haven&#39;t done that yet, but I will. Thank you!

Again, please report any issues you run into, from site-breaking issues to mild inconveniences; every bit of info is useful. I can always triage minor things down, but if I don&#39;t know about them, they won&#39;t ever get fixed.

Major change: I&#39;ve done a reasonably hefty revamp of the theme. It should now look better off mobile and considerably better, though still not as good, *on* mobile. If you were grumbling about the site layout on mobile let me know what you think; I&#39;m not totally satisfied but it&#39;ll be a lot more work to shape it up further.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilj878k/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ili33i1/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Following up my ‚Äúequality‚Äù post from the other day, I will talk about abortion a</title><updated>2022-08-23T20:16:49Z</updated><author><name>Lorelei_On_The_Rocks</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Following up my ‚Äúequality‚Äù post from the other day, I will talk about abortion and the way in which I strongly disagree with the framing on both sides of the issue. I think abortion is a similar issue because, like &#34;equality,&#34; people on &#34;both sides of the issue&#34; today share much more common ground than they think, and are thoroughly blinkered as a result. 

The ‚Äúanti-abortion‚Äù side is pretty straightforward, at least ostensibly. ‚ÄúHuman life is sacred, fetus is human life, therefore no kill.‚Äù 

The ‚Äúpro-abortion‚Äù side cannot dispute the idea that human life qua human life, that is, individual members of the biological species *homo sapiens*, is sacred and inherently worthy protecting. So they must marshal different sorts of arguments, appealing to bodily autonomy or the inhumanity of the fetus. 

Intuitively, to me, it‚Äôs obvious that abortion is not equal to murder. It also seems to have been obvious to most people through most of history, since abortion has rarely ever been considered equal to murder, by law or custom. Even when it has been considered unsavory and even criminal, it was not considered equivalent to stabbing a man in the street or dashing out an infant‚Äôs brains. 

Why is this? I think it is the same the reason that, in the classical world, infanticide was not considered equal to murder, either. Exposure was a common practice in the ancient world. Anti-abortion activists today are very fond of pointing out that the vast majority of abortion is not in cases of rape or incest, but simply in cases of a mother who does not feel she is ‚Äúready‚Äù or ‚Äúcapable‚Äù of taking care of a child. Likewise, in the ancient world, countless babies were exposed with the rationale, ‚Äújust another mouth to feed,‚Äù or even, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wanna take care of this thing,&#34; and thus left to die on rubbish heaps. 

Again, this was a practice that was sometimes frowned upon, sometimes condemned, though never outlawed as far as I know, but never considered equal to actual murder. 

This is because to be a full-fledged ‚Äúhuman‚Äù it is not enough to be a biological member of the species *homo sapiens*. Humanity is contextual as much, or more so, as it is biological. To be a human means having a place in a social structure, obligations and rights. You have parents, children, brothers, sisters, friends, patrons, clients. You understand religion, history, civic duty. 

If a member of the species *homo sapiens* was raised by wolves in the forest, and grew up without language, human parents, friends, religion, ethics, or socialization of any kind, he would be morally equal to a wild beast and could be killed with the same impunity as a wolf. A fetus, or an infant for that matter, is in the same position. This is what makes abortion unequal to murder, if it is a crime at all. 

Modern anti-abortion activists cannot make this argument because they are, like their enemies, wedded to the idea that being homo sapiens makes one inherently sacred.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ili33i1/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilhv3u3/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] I&#39;ve been thinking about two US tax policies that seem to never go away despite </title><updated>2022-08-23T19:26:18Z</updated><author><name>russokumo</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">I&#39;ve been thinking about two US tax policies that seem to never go away despite broad popular support when explained to the public in plain English:
1) carried interest 
2) the step up basis for inheriting equities

The vast vast majority of Americans are not private equity managers (and probably don&#39;t know any....) or rich enough to have any inheritance tax levied on them. Yet the interests of the wealthy have bought the ears of our elected officials. The cost seems very very minimal too, maybe just a couple million a year of campaign contributions to a handful of pivotal senators to save tens of billions in taxes over time.

Even though the pundit class all knows about these, my suspicion is that the public doesn&#39;t care because these things seem like too arcane of details.

This to me is a fundamental unfairness within democracy. Yes technically we are a system of one person one vote, but as wealth can compound in an unlimited way AND wealth can be converted to equal political influence, we are destined to live in effectively an oligarchy.

Yes sometimes the oligarchies views can be swayed through naming and shaming and their offspring indoctrinated, but by and large we are much closer to 1$ 1 vote than 1 person 1 vote. Some among us may even view this as just in the sense that entrepreneurs who provide the most value to society should have a greater influence on society, but we&#39;re setting up a society where it&#39;s far more likely that someone who&#39;s rich is able to become an entrepreneur in the first place, ala Elon musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates. In addition to the genetic advantages of having smart parents, they also were afforded the connections and wealth to enable them to take risks.

With immigration of the best and brightest from around the world + randomness of genetics one generation to the next, there is still some chance of social mobility in the USA.

But I fear we are heading towards more and more of a static society of a late stage empire. Maybe with genetic engineering available and AGI light being owned by Google shareholders soon, we truly will revert to Neo feudalism, but gattaca style. Where everyone in society knows there station and doesn&#39;t bother rising above it.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilhv3u3/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ile306e/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Stable Diffusion was released to [public beta](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-</title><updated>2022-08-23T00:03:08Z</updated><author><name>Then_Election_7412</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Stable Diffusion was released to [public beta](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) today, complete with weights. In general, it seems comparable to DALLE2, Imagen, and Parti, beating them in some ways and losing to them in others; the most general comment I&#39;d offer is that it seems to do worse with semantic content and better with textures. This isn&#39;t too important: the next generation (which is to say, 6-12 months from now) will beat all of them in all their best aspects.

Aside from a lot of verbiage around using it ethically, the official and publicly hosted version includes a safety classifier that removes bad outputs. Yay? Of course, since it&#39;s open source, it&#39;s easy enough to modify the code, and the world got right to it. We already have the UnstableDiffusion and PornDiffusion subreddits, and there will be an proliferation of them and their content in the coming months without the need to dance around the OpenAI and Google ~~blacklists~~ blocklists. I mentioned this to a friend, and she said that at least we&#39;ll have a couples years before we could supply images of a person and have porn generated from them. I didn&#39;t have the heart to point her to [textual-inversion](https://textual-inversion.github.io/). Who&#39;d have thought porn actresses would be some of the first to fall to AI? If it&#39;s any consolation to them, many other occupations are going to be wiped out in the coming first wave.

It seems like society is not just unprepared for this but unaware of how far along we are in the automated generation of digital content. For awhile it seemed like the hope was that professional gatekeepers would protect us, but it was obvious that strategy just needed a single defector to fail. If it wasn&#39;t Stability, it&#39;d have been Yandex. If it wasn&#39;t Yandex, it would be a leak.

Regardless, now the cat is out of the bag. I don&#39;t think there was or is any way to prevent or stop this, or even that it&#39;s bad that it&#39;s happening. What does seem likely is that we&#39;re in for a rough ride as society reacts to something that&#39;s blindsided it.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ile306e/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilcwl5b/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] I took apart the drain for reasons.

The tall white pipe goes to the grey pipe. The U-pipe connects the tall white pipe to the one leading into the wall.

The pieces do assemble in something resembling a pipe, and water gets through them, but the connection is way too loose and water leaks all over the place.

There is this rubber washer where the U-pipe means the straight white pipe and it does not feel like it is seated right.

It&#39;s hard to say without looking in the rearview mirror but from my vantage point while opposition may have slowed its ascent, it hasn&#39;t managed to reverse the gains.

Case in point: https://www.aier.org/article/the-suicide-of-the-american-historical-association/

Basically, the AHA President dared to offer the mildest of critiques of the &#39;1619&#39; project and now his own members are baying for his blood in the form of a career defenestration. He has hardly any defenders within his organisation and he&#39;s the top guy, so what hope is there for someone with less status within the history profession?

DeSantis&#39; so-called &#34;anti-woke laws&#34; were all stopped by a federal judge. He hopes his voters don&#39;t pay attention and he gives no indications of trying to fight hard to overrule  any of these setbacks.

University of Tennessee - supposedly in a red state where the GOP has political control - has [massively ramped](https://twitter.com/JohnDSailer/status/1559605619857956864) up the DIE (Diversity, Inclusion, Equity) policies.

The GOP appears content in complaining but doing little to combat any of this by using state power. As long as this is the case, my prediction is that &#39;wokism&#39;, for a lack of a better term, is here to stay.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilctpsy/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilcqjvm/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Long-time lurker, and appreciator, of the discussions had in this subreddit.

One topic that has captured my attention recently is the structure of bureaucracies and mechanisms for accountability and efficiency leading to the question below:

**Are accountability and efficiency for a government organization mutually exclusive? Is there an agency/department (U.S. or non-U.S.) that is regarded as possessing both?**

It strikes me from work in the U.S. public sector that the old observation that the government moves slowly to be true. 

Anecdotally, it seems the slowness stems from countless procedures of reviews to ensure legal and policy compliance. Multiple offices all cover similar portfolios with numerous redundancies and these offices will collaborate to draft policy and regulations. Policy drafts will then undergo legal review by multiple lawyers (with the severity of the policy determining just how high up the bureaucratic lawyer-chain it must go). Further compounding the wait time is after the legal review, you typically have to add on the wait time for a government executive to review the policy, receive a briefing on it (if they desire), and then approve it.

Colleagues and managers claim all of this is to ensure the organizations involved did their due diligence in the name of public interest. To them, fewer layers of review may speed things along, but that arrangement would open said policy/regulation to greater risk, whether in the form of a legal challenge or unintended consequence. I however wonder if there is an example of a government organization with processes that disprove this assertion. Must a government organization move slow to be accountable?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilcqjvm/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilc7l68/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Got my first reddit cares notice.

Isn‚Äôt consumerism and inequity better to focus on, as it wastes more resources more flagrantly? For instance, Jeff Bezos wasting resources on yachts and so on, while squeezing the lowest workers dry; financial sector employees wasting resources on fancy things, while taking over companies to fire the slightly inefficient employees. Our system seems hyperfocused on inefficiencies of the lower class, while almost completely ignoring the inefficiencies of the upper class re: resource utilization. Consider how the upper echelon of Walmart waste exorbitant resources on multiple mansions, needless cars, needless trips, etc. It makes me wonder whether unionization and labor bargaining wouldn‚Äôt ultimately be more resource-efficient, as a way to prevent Bezosian wastefulness. 

Like sure, we could fire warehouse Bob because we can force warehouse Joe to do his job, if we cut Joe‚Äôs breaks down to 15 minutes and prevent him from talking at the water cooler. And if this existence is unlivable we can replace him with Juan when he dies from a fentanyl overdose. Or Bob and Joe can band together and fire Office Edward, who takes home extra resources akin to 40 Bobs a year, and wastes them buying vodka with gold flakes in it. Which one is really immoral and deserving of efficiency-finding? I refuse to believe Office Edward is actually that valuable in terms of what he brings to the company, having known Office Edward, and MBA programs are a meme. Maybe it‚Äôs better for society for Bob and Joe to get some slack versus Edward getting 1000x the slack.

This question is kind of reinventing the wheel, but this is the angle I‚Äôm trying to look at.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilc7b6h/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilc7269/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Is there actually any evidence that sexual activity before a certain age is harm</title><updated>2022-08-22T16:20:44Z</updated><author><name>MacaqueOfTheNorth</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Is there actually any evidence that sexual activity before a certain age is harmful and if so, is it actually less harmful if the other person is close in age?

Article is in three parts.

(1) is a wall of snapshots from the &#34;trending topics&#34; bar on Twitter for the past two weeks, with dates, as well as a snapshot of Google Trends showing that (a) the war between the Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists (TERFs) and the gender ideology wokes is getting extremely hot, and the burn rate keeps it pretty much squarely on Twitter nonstop, above Ukraine and guns and abortion. The Google Trends graphs show TERF &amp;gt; Intersectionality in interest solidly the past two months and has intermittent peaks well above it, landing the TERF wars in a position where they seem to be overtaking even the heat level of Whiteness related topics during Floyd.

(2) is a recap of the history of the TERF war that most people here can probably skip

(3) is analysis, wherein we attempt to explain why it&#39;s getting so hot, and make predictions about what&#39;s going to happen with it going forward into next year based on an analysis of motivations of either side. Key to the analysis is the presumption that personality traits are probably fairly fixed over time due to genetic factors, which means as religiosity has fallen over time, more people with the &#34;moral certainty and self righteous indignation&#34; traits have had to find another outlet, many of which fell into the Woke bucket. With a fixed (or growing) rate of these in the woke camp, they won&#39;t bend on trans ideology even in the face of all the new entrants to the TERF war driven by school board awakenings and JK Rowling acting as a rally point.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilbqfeg/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilbpwre/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] So reading some substacks has reminded me that there are basically four differen</title><updated>2022-08-22T14:27:37Z</updated><author><name>EngageInFisticuffs</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">So reading some substacks has reminded me that there are basically four different kinds of writers on the culture war, or really any kind of commentary on conflict. 

1. Partisan propagandists. These are your Nathan J Robinsons. Their positions are predetermined, so their analyses are rarely anything but hackneyed. &#34;My side is good, the other side is bad,&#34; doesn&#39;t leave much room for nuance *or* actual insight. I used Robinson as an easy example, but there are plenty of weird Trumpists who somehow wanted to say that Russia were the good guys invading Ukraine. Although I&#39;ll totally admit that they&#39;re analyses weren&#39;t stale to start off with, they still quickly became predictable.

2. Cynics/insult analysts. I am struggling to come up with any examples right now, but there are a lot of these in respected editorial positions. These people sometimes have interesting analysis, but so often they resort to content-free insults in order to show their disdain and that they are above the conflict. Never do they ever have actually constructive things to say. They just tear stuff down.These types of analysts had their hey day in the 90s, but plenty of them are still going by inertia in respected legacy media even today. This is actually the group that annoys me the most and got me to write up this analysis because I always forget they exist, and I will be fooled into reading some article because it isn&#39;t just partisan drivel, only to realize that it is the equivalent of socio-political malingering and their delight in being unorthodox is an end-goal in itself.

3. (Un)orthodox ideologues. These are your Rod Drehers and Freddie DeBoers. Although they certainly have a side in the conflict, that side is just a means to an end, not a cause in itself. They have some greater vision that they are loyal to, and this allows them to see and critique &#34;their&#34; side in surprising and effective ways and see value in proposals from their &#34;opponents.&#34; These are the types of editorials that are really interesting to read.

4. Exhaustively fair analysts. These are the Scott Alexanders. This is the rarest type, at least in conflict commentary. Most of the people who do this are probably being paid plenty of money for private analysis. Or, if not private, at least largely wonky topics that most people don&#39;t care about. Still, these are the gold standard when it comes to commentary. Not just because if their analysis, they aren&#39;t necessarily any more insightful than the 3s, but because their attempts to engage with all opinions charitably makes them powerful when it comes to persuasion. 1s are also very powerful when it comes to persuasion with their audience, but only on whatever topics won&#39;t make them considered traitors to their cause/audience. Scott has no such limits, and as a result he has convinced people to change positions on all sorts of issues. He has made people more trans-sympathetic and turned leftists into free-market supporters.  But it is also the hardest to do. People have complained that Scott doesn&#39;t really dig in and engage with a lot of topics like he used to. This style of writing takes the most intellectual and emotional energy. It&#39;s much harder than when you already know everyone on the other side is bad and wrong and your side is good and right. Or everyone is just corrupt and stupid, no matter the side.

Not sure this is totally culture war, except for the fact that nuclear power itself has been such a wretched target of environmentalist culture warriors that we haven&#39;t bothered to build any nuke plants in the USA in decades.

The article does the math to figure out how much power is generated by uranium and coal, and calculates an equivalent amount of pollutant for honest comparisons. Really pretty simple. Conclusion is that two nuclear fuel assemblies of uranium, each of which are about a half a meter long and ten centimeters wide, produce the same amount of energy as enough coal to fill up (with CO2) every hot air balloon at the  Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta (largest hot air balloon festival in the world) almost 24 times over.

Then has some visual comparisons, so people can understand the scales in question.

I also reduced the article into image meme form:

It‚Äôs rather like panning for gold. There‚Äôs a steady stream of dirt but almost on a daily basis you will find the seed of a worthwhile idea or some information that‚Äôs being suppressed/ignored in mainstream circles.
     
I suspect this is something most curious people do, even ‚Äúintelligent presenting‚Äù people who keep their rhetoric straight and opinions inoffensive. I wonder if it‚Äôs an unspoken secret, some habit we engage with after dark.
    
During covid this became a daily activity for me. I hated it though. I hated that information and idea exchange were as locked down as we were physically. I knew any given /r/lockdownskepticism post or idea could be just as valuable as a post made in any mainstream subreddit - I could sort through the bullshit. But I also knew any information outside the establishment view was going to be tainted and treated as false purely by association being stuck in the conspiracy bin.
   
Many dissenting views and/or information which contradicted the dogma of the day regarding covid were relegated to the corners of the internet which the establishment media and institutions label as crazy and dangerous.
  
Essentially, in tandem with the government, social media companies helped create a rhetorical landscape where the only information the public would consume and digest through free discourse was information they deemed acceptable.
  
You could talk about lab leak theory but it would have to be next to the tweaker claiming *they* are transmitting covid via 5G Wi-Fi signals. You could talk about potential or active side effects of the vaccine but it would have to be lumped in with people claiming everyone who got it would die within a year.
   
This seems like the playbook for how ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù is going to be handled online and it‚Äôs rather concerning to me. With that in mind I‚Äôm actually drawn to check in on these forums even more. Covid information control made me wonder what else am I going to miss if I just stick to mainstream sources‚Ä¶ And where else am I to find this information but the black market of ideas?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilbllbf/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilb4fkt/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Anyone got recommendations for audiobooks?

As you can guess by the demographics of this sub, preferably fantasy/scifi or nonfiction history.

If anyone else is looking for something, I&#39;ve really enjoyed the bobbiverse series (4th book is out, if anyone read/heard the first 3 and liked them), it&#39;s exactly at the perfect line of engaging enough to stay interesting but also not too complicated and not too action-laden so that I love to hear it in the evening/night to calm down. Basic premise is that the main character is an AI replicant of a human that existed at some point, trying to cope with his new existence as a von Neumann probe. He ultimately builds up an interstellar empire, the bobbiverse, entirely consisting of clones of himself. It&#39;s not super deep but handles many different topics, most of them reasonably well, without devolving into an author tract. For the most part refreshingly positive in attitude, which is unusual in scifi in my experience.

The First Law Trilogy, which I think was recommended here before, is okay. It&#39;s reasonably recent but is heavily reminiscent of 90s dark gritty fantasy, in both bad and good ways. A bit slow start though, and I saw the ending coming from a mile, both of which diminished my fun significantly. But the author does avoid all the most common pitfalls, like getting too overly grimdark , obvious self inserts/mary sue etc. .

&#34;The Murderbot Diaries&#34; is something I&#39;ve recently heard as well, but can&#39;t really recommend. Also with a sentient AI as the MC, it starts out as a decent if a bit repetitious contender in the &#34;dark gritty scifi comedy&#34;, but after some time the politics of the author become increasingly clear and it devolves into extremely simple black (corporations) vs white (nonbinary environmentally friendly slavery abolishing scientist communist utopia). If you like the premise, read/hear the first few stories, but don&#39;t expect it to hold up long.

All three however have decent speakers and are enjoyable to listen to.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilb4fkt/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilapfpy/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] **Nuclear weapons are a panacea that would bring us close to world peace were it</title><updated>2022-08-22T08:21:11Z</updated><author><name>alphanumericsprawl</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">**Nuclear weapons are a panacea that would bring us close to world peace were it not for the US**

Every so often, people bring up the fact that Taiwan&#39;s military spending is moribund, somewhere below 2% of GDP (China is at a similar level). The US is around 4%. They call for Taiwan to [get serious](https://international.thenewslens.com/article/123554) with its training and spend more on their own defence. It does not seem fair for the US to spend proportionately more for another countries security...

However, there is only so much that Taiwan can do when outnumbered 20:1 in GDP. Taiwan is totally dependent upon foreign fuel and foreign food. The island produces around 10% of their food, China around 65%. There is only one way Taiwan could hope to deter the vastly larger Chinese military: nuclear weapons. The US [shut down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction) the Taiwanese nuclear program twice. Now, the US has forward-based nuclear weapons to Taiwan in the past but it is unlikely to do so today, given that China now has the power to hit the US mainland. 

If Taiwan had nuclear weapons, there would be no potential crisis. China would not invade a country with a credible nuclear deterrent. The US enabled this looming disaster by suppressing Taiwan&#39;s nuclear ambitions and giving them vague, indefinite not-promises instead.

Since Pakistan and India acquired nuclear weapons, they had only one small skirmish when in the past they would wage full-scale wars. Naturally, the US [sanctioned and harassed](https://www.eetimes.com/u-s-lifts-sanctions-against-india-pakistan/) them for taking this step towards peace. 

There have been no full-scale great power conflicts since WW2, a 70-year historical anomaly. Nuclear weapons make it unprofitable to wage war, so states don&#39;t do it.

If my country, Australia, had nuclear weapons, we wouldn&#39;t need to fight in expensive, pointless US wars since we wouldn&#39;t need their nuclear umbrella or assistance. We would have genuine strategic independence, we could relax and enjoy mining rent.

Now, one counterargument to my nuclear panacea argument is the tail-risk of nuclear war. If the US weren&#39;t so irresponsible, there would have been a much lower chance of nuclear war during the Cold War. It was the US&#39;s decision to invent the Cuban Missile Crisis, violently objecting to internal defense decisions made by the Soviets and Cubans. There are obvious similarities with the current Ukraine war and there is the mitigating factor that Cuba was in the US sphere while Ukraine is/was/contested in the Russian sphere. I don&#39;t particularly want to get bogged down in the movement of spheres of influence though. The way the US handled the crisis was extraordinarily aggressive. The US imposed a &#39;quarantine&#39; of Cuba, an effective blockade. They flew [U-2 spy planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis#Crisis_continues) over Cuban airspace and had the temerity to complain when one was shot down! They dropped dummy depth charges on Soviet submarines to force them to surface, pointlessly causing the drama that legendary Arkhipov had to resolve. The US took various steps to raise tensions, dispersing its bombers around civilian airports and keeping some constantly in the air. They made it look as though they were preparing for nuclear war.

The 1983 nuclear scare is also the US&#39;s fault. Why were they launching [psychological operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83#Psychological_operations) and exercises right next to Kamchatka if not to spook the Soviets? Raising tensions in this way is deeply irresponsible, it erodes the commons of mutually assured destruction to eke out small-scale gains in analyzing Soviet military readiness, observing radar patterns etc... It&#39;s needlessly provocative to mock-punch somebody but pull your fist away at the last moment. SDI was similarly bad - if you don&#39;t want a nuclear war, don&#39;t invite a pre-emptive strike by creating a strategic defense system! Of course, the US is still doing it, they left the ABM treaty and have been building up a large missile defense apparatus via AEGIS and GMD.

While North Korean leadership is regularly labelled as insane, they have not invaded anybody since the 1950s. Iran hasn&#39;t invaded anyone either, though they do wage proxy war (an activity not unknown by the US). On what basis can we argue that they would be irresponsible nuclear powers? Occasional political rhetoric calling for the destruction of Israel should not come before the logic of MAD, which has a far stronger empirical and historical basis. The Israelis have their fare share of [religious terrorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_religious_terrorism), yet they have remained responsible with their arsenal. 

Obviously, it&#39;s advantageous for the US (and other nuclear powers to a lesser extent) to sanction and bully other states into refraining from nuclearizing. The more states that have nuclear weapons, the less powerful they become. If Iraq or Libya had nukes, the US couldn&#39;t have attacked them. The US of course has the strongest global power projection capacity and thus the most to lose from massive nuclearization. It isn&#39;t surprising that the US is the most eager to suppress nuclear weapons. 

But I think this is important to consider when we discuss the looming risk of war, of geopolitical conflict generally. The assumption of nuclear risk in my view is excessively high and confuses nuclear risks with US risks. If Ukraine had nuclear weapons, there would be no problem today. What is far more destabilizing are airy promises of unspecified support for countries far away from their nuclear patron. Taiwan is only the most obvious example.

If the non-proliferation treaty didn&#39;t exist, the world would be a much better place and there would be fewer wars.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilapfpy/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilap2wy/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Some culture war material from India.

Recently, Independent put out a [piece](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/british-indians-racism-muslim-islamophobia-b2149026.html?utm_content=Echobox&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Main&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1660996247) that turned a lot of heads in Indian online space. Over the past decade, the political zeitgeist in India has been apparently captured indisputably by Hindu Nationalism in the national capacity, while still struggling in many states. Any strand of liberalism left isn&#39;t really a direction anymore, but pressure from above or outside. The term &#39;South Asia&#39; is not very well liked in India, which is seen by many nationalists as a reductionism of their civilisation to another geographic patch of landmass and above all, a tacit affirmation of the current nation states of India and Pakistan as equally legitimate in inheriting the cultural ethnos of the subcontinent.

But in more recent years, the term has produced another bone to pick. White liberals are largely seen as the new cultural imperialists out to atomise societies and rearrange social relations between the sexes, ethnic groups, etc. They&#39;re also seen as militantly anti-India on matters such as Kashmir, with &#39;South Asian&#39; think tanks being their academic arm to dissipate psyops against India. Finally, they&#39;re perceived to be tacitly pro-Pakistan. The last one is a litmus test for a lot of Indians as to whether its all about values or consumer demographics. Is Hindu Nationalism a genuine concern, or just another cudgel against Indians? If Indians are fair game to be criticised for their attitude towards Pakistanis, the reverse should be axiomatic, correct? Well, BBC and other media are seen as hypocritically smearing India over its domestic problems with communalism, caste, gender, etc., while violent crimes by Pakistani origin men in the UK are obscured, leave alone Pakistan&#39;s own social problems. Last year, NYT&#39;s [job listing](https://www.newslaundry.com/2021/07/08/did-nyts-job-posting-for-a-business-correspondent-in-india-deserve-the-outrage-it-got) for an India correspondent sparked a huge furore in Indian media. The part about India&#39;s South Asian neighbours especially raised eyebrows as to whether the implication was that India is the belligerent actor in the region, when every single one of the [Indo-Pak wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts) was initiated by Pakistan, one of which even involved a [huge genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide) by the Pakistani Army. This event is not discussed in the media, and Indian syllabi consider every even after Independence as contemporary history, so its not discussed in history textbooks either. But ever since war ignited in Ukraine almost 6 months ago, and India&#39;s repeated refusal to condemn the invasion and continued purchase of Russian oil, 1971 has been resuscitated yet again, as was Soviet support to India at the time. Suddenly, many Hindu Nationalists who were previously indifferent to Russia, turned [Russophilic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/29/india-russia-ukraine-media/). But I think this is largely out of hostility to liberals than anything else.

For now, it looks like Hindu Nationalism is not about to lose its political clout in India and this will continue to leave lots of annoyance with liberals. Even the BJP&#39;s political opponents have caved on key issues like the [Rohingya refugees](http://twocircles.net/2022aug22/446679.html) to pose any competition. In all, the Nehruvian era Congress elites simply did not connect to the subalterns in producing the cultural and economic prosperity that they had wanted, whether in their socialist shade during the Cold War or in their neoliberal shade since 2004. And the vacuum it left behind is no longer its own to fill.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilap2wy/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilab9wd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] So, this is going to be a case of &#34;sheltered religious conservative doesn&#39;t unde</title><updated>2022-08-22T05:16:44Z</updated><author><name>urquan5200</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">So, this is going to be a case of &#34;sheltered religious conservative doesn&#39;t understand slang&#34; but... what is a fuckboy?

I&#39;m picking up Kamachi&#39;s *A Certain Magical Index*, book 1. The anime was...fascinating in strange ways. Every time the topic was science, it was incredibly compelling. On the other hand, every time the topic was magic, it was horribly dull. This had the unfortunate effect of making the show boring whenever Touma was on-screen, and the very fortunate effect of making the spin-off anime *A Certain Scientific Railgun* excellent. My theory is that the writer has a respectable IQ and excellent writing talent, so whenever there&#39;s some real-world basis (however distant) for his thoughts like the science parts, it&#39;s hard not to be sucked in. But whenever the topic is based on non-empirical things, all we get is a jumble of complex thoughts that can&#39;t be understood unless you&#39;re the author.

On reflection, Academy City is a very dark dream, a place where every citizen is an experiment, everyone is complicit, and criminality is institutionalized. Nevertheless the peace of the everyday lives of the characters is the true focus, together with a desire to hold on to gratitude at having met the people they call friends, despite the nature of the place that they met them in. Hopefully the book will bring out more of the compelling side of this author by giving more breathing room to his thoughts.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/il85eue/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/il7repi/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Where are all the East Asian CEOs?

As background, I took an AP Comp Sci class in highschool, and then mostly didn&#39;t do programming in undergrad except occasionally messing around on my calculator as I majored in Math.  In grad school, I ended up drifting more in the direction of game theory, and started doing mathematical modeling, which gradually become more and more of my emphasis until now as a postdoc that&#39;s pretty much all that I do.  I create a mathematical model that models some scenario, program it, explore the results of the model and tweak stuff, and then write and publish results about it.

Also, I program almost exclusively in Java because that&#39;s what I learned in highschool, though I have dabbled in a couple other languages.

So I do a lot of programming, but it&#39;s all self-contained stuff meant for my own use, and mostly self-taught via googling things whenever I need to know how to do something.  I&#39;m pretty good at taking a thing I need to do and hacking together the right steps and loops in the right order to make it work, but I suspect a more well-studied programmer would look at my spaghetti code in horror.  In particular, I suspect that my main flaws are

1. Lack of comments.  I sometimes write them, but often don&#39;t because I know what I&#39;m doing in the moment and also keep changing things on the fly

2. Lack of optimization.  I&#39;m aware that this is a thing, and the general idea.  I can make sure I don&#39;t use like a O(n^3 ) structure if a O(n^2 ) will do or something, but I haven&#39;t learned like common techniques for recognizing shortcuts that save processing time, or like this function nobody ever uses because it&#39;s ten times less efficient than this equivalent function.

3. General project organization?  Like, I separate stuff into classes and methods, and try to keep them organized nicely, but often it ends up as spaghetti code and when I want to do multiple algorithms that are similar but with slightly different steps, I&#39;m never sure whether to copy/paste a new method and change stuff there, or try to make one method more robust with booleans to toggle different steps on and off.  And like, planning ahead to make stuff more robust ahead of time and save time in the future.


Stuff like that.  And just general practices.  As I&#39;m looking towards possibly moving out of academia and into industry, I&#39;m worried my code will look very amateur and be hard for other people to use if I end up collaborating with people and/or designing something used by someone other than myself.  I&#39;m hoping to find some sort of resource that I can use to learn techniques for code design/structure/planning/efficiency, without wasting my time on basics of how to code in the first place that I already know.

I&#39;m talking obscure but reasonable.

I feel like everybody in Forums/subreddits like these, talks with an undercurrent of belonging to the shadow government looking down on society discussing how to rearrange it.

That may sound elitist and maybe even an insult but it is way better than being in a comment section where people are insulting each other over grammatical errors.

The story of my smoking experiences with pork are ones of being off by multiple hours in terms of completion, so I&#39;m working a whole day ahead of time. If I get done early, which has never happened, I&#39;ll wrap the meat in aluminum trays and keep it warm. 

Since most of y&#39;all are on the west coast I assume the proclivity for cooking vast cuts of meat this way isn&#39;t as popular as it is around my neck of the woods. But right now I have a small electric Masterbilt smoker. It was unbelievably affordable in my estimation, it&#39;s relatively easy to clean, but I&#39;ve been electrocuted while it&#39;s sprinkling a couple times and I&#39;ve always wondered if I should be stepping up to a pellet grill at some point. Any comment from someone who&#39;s made the move would be welcome. I only smoke stuff 6-7 times a year, so perhaps it&#39;s a luxury I shouldn&#39;t be considering anyway.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/ws5dhg/friday_fun_thread_for_august_19_2022/ikxlm5f/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/ws5dhg/friday_fun_thread_for_august_19_2022/ikwl5po/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] It&#39;s Janmashtami today.

Janmashtami is the day when Lord Krishna was born. He is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and is one of the most beloved deity.

He was the charioteer for the supreme warrior Arjun during the Mahabharat. Arjuna didn&#39;t want to fight the war and Lord Krishna had a long conversation with him about life which is known as the Gita, the supreme Scripture for many Hindus.

I shall fast today and spend time with my family, read some theology thanks to Gita Press Gorakhpur.

The very first thing this commentary on the Gita says  is that one must appreciate being born a human. We can experience, conceive and feel divinity, something no other being can do and no matter how bad things are, we will always be lucky as compared to most animals.

This isn&#39;t the same as me going out for talking to girls or consuming substances but I like this a lot. I find theology quite profound and enjoyable to read. I find it more than just fun and hence the motif to post about today here.

May Lord Krishna bless us all. Happy Janmashtami to everyone reading this.

Jai Shri Krishna.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/ws5dhg/friday_fun_thread_for_august_19_2022/ikwl5po/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
