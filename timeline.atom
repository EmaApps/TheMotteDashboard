This means that they&#39;re the third most advanced chip manufacturer, behind only Samsung in Korea and TSMC in Taiwan. Taiwan and Samsung are both on 5nm and introducing 3nm. Global Foundries is the top Euro-American fab and straggles far behind at 12nm.

Apparently China&#39;s 7nm chips are qualitatively inferior to TSMC/Samsung 7nm since the US is still blocking technology transfers of the special ultraviolet etching technology you need for better production. This may constrain them somewhat in the future. 

However, the situation at present is Samsung &amp;gt; TSMC &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  SMIC &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; everyone else. Samsung got to 3nm first, which upset the usual order of TSMC being number 1. As far as I can tell, all the big players can design chips, it&#39;s only manufacturing that&#39;s seriously difficult. How long will the UV tech sanctions hold back China? They have no shortage of money or brainpower. Let&#39;s also consider that our active sabotage of Chinese semiconductors is somehow less damaging than whatever we did to our own industries. Why is it that China is still ahead of our own fabs?

Contra others in the previous thread who argued that China isn&#39;t a serious threat to US/Western hegemony, I maintain that China is an extremely strong challenger the likes of which we&#39;ve never seen. They have unparalleled industrial scale - they&#39;ve significantly outpaced US naval shipbuilding for years now. When it comes to steel, cars, chemicals, HSR, solar panels and ports they&#39;re well ahead of any Western country. This is what we should expect from a country with a larger population than all Western civilization combined. Efficiencies of scale are no joke.

If you combine industrial scale with high-tech expertise, what more do you need? The best technology and the largest numbers = ultimate power. I&#39;ve argued in the past that we should have put more effort into [suppressing China](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/ln1sv9/maginot_syndrome_bullish_for_han_hegemony/) back when they were weak. We wasted nearly 30 years after Tienanmen square, after the point where it should have been clear that they weren&#39;t just going to capitulate like the Russians. Let&#39;s not forget the 1996 3rd Taiwan straits crisis. If that&#39;s not hostility, what is?

Up until the mid 2000s the US could have obliterated the Chinese nuclear arsenal in a disarming strike. See pages 295-6 of the [Rand report](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR392.html): they show that Chinese ICBMs were immensely vulnerable. China&#39;s single abysmally noisy and crappy ballistic missile sub would surely get sunk before travelling halfway across the Pacific to retaliate against the US. The US could have dictated terms to China about Taiwan, they could have enforced a blockade with ease. This is no longer the case, the US doesn&#39;t have escalation dominance up to strategic nuclear war. China&#39;s conventional capabilities are immensely stronger than they were, just look at all the green bars going to yellow and orange on the RAND graph. That is what getting weaker looks like.

We are doing something seriously wrong. IBM and Intel used to lead in semiconductor development. [US hypersonics have stagnated](https://www.science.org/content/article/national-pride-stake-russia-china-united-states-race-build-hypersonic-weapons) and now fallen behind China and Russia. They&#39;ve deployed weapons, US tests don&#39;t even [work](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/30/politics/us-hypersonic-missile-test-fails/index.html). I believe there is some [malaise](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/china-acquiring-new-weapons-five-times-faster-than-u-s-warns-top-official) in our cultures that leads us to just take things less seriously than China does:

&amp;gt;“In purchasing power parity, they spend about one dollar to our 20 dollars to get to the same capability,” he told his audience. “We are going to lose if we can’t figure out how to drop the cost and increase the speed in our defense supply chains,” Holt added.

The same sort of effect applies to civilian products - there is surely a reason US semiconductor production died, why California&#39;s HSR takes so long and costs so much. If we&#39;re outnumbered, we need to work harder or work smarter. It doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;re doing either, just coasting on old advantages.

While many say that China doesn&#39;t have global ambitions, they have cultivated border disputes with most of their neighbors. They have an ideological goal in establishing their system as the moral/normative peer of liberal democracy. They also have the world&#39;s biggest trading economy - they naturally have global interests in resources and securing markets. One Belt One Road was an attempt to realign the world economy to favor China. And they&#39;ll get drawn into various conflicts just because they&#39;re so big. Power is seductive and addictive, as the US has discovered. There&#39;s also a lot of nationalism swirling around, a substitute for traditional Maoism/Marxism which they don&#39;t even practice. There&#39;s immense popular resentment with the US over bombing their embassy in Serbia, various aerial incidents, rhetorical support for Hong Kong, military support for Taiwan...

I judge that China has more potential for global intervention than the once-isolationist US back at the start of the 20th century. They have a similarly large industrial base, more need for overseas resources, are closer to Eurasia, are more nationalistic and much more bitter. The story of the 20th century was the US leaving its corner and dominating the world. The story of the 21st may be China doing the same.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih4w2le/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih4l4i1/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] TW: Navel gazing and red-tribe/blue-tribe palm reading 

Yarvin has a new piece </title><updated>2022-07-22T00:41:46Z</updated><author><name>NotATleilaxuGhola</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">TW: Navel gazing and red-tribe/blue-tribe palm reading 

Yarvin has a new piece in typical Yarvin style (long on flourishes, short on substance) call [&#34;You Can Only Lose the Culture War.&#34;](https://graymirror.substack.com/p/you-can-only-lose-the-culture-war)  In it, he makes a (muddled) Tolkein analogy, casting the blue tribe as &#34;elves&#34; and the red tribe as &#34;hobbits&#34;:  
  
&amp;gt;We know who are the hobbits and who are the elves. We know who is on top and who is on the bottom. (Of dwarves and orcs, we shall not speak.) We know what the elves want: they want to live beautiful lives. We know what the hobbits want: they want to grill and raise kids.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;Dear hobbits: you can only lose the culture war. Even when elves use political power to impose elf culture on you, you cannot use political power to impose hobbit culture on elves.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;I mean, sometimes (rarely) you can. It never works out well. I suppose that in theory you could massacre all the elves. You don’t seem up for that in practice. As an elf… I have to regard that as a good thing. But it leaves you, dear hobbits, in a real bind.  
  
And then he adds a third group, the &#34;dark elves&#34;:

&amp;gt;Moreover, when hobbits try to take revenge on elves at large, or even worse when they actually succeed, they are damaging a resource they do not even know they have. There may even be some elves—the dark elves—who are actually on the hobbits’ side.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;Naturally, being traitors and all, these dark elves keep a low profile. But culturally, they are still totally elves and into, like, “art films” and stuff. Any attack on elves in general weakens and demoralizes this important fifth column. What are they useful for, these dark elves? See below.  
  
This sounds like shorthand for dissident blue tribers, maybe more specifically dissident blue tribe PMC members.  
  
At first, when I read this, I thought of myself as a hobbit.  The hobbits (peasants), according to Yarvin, are hopeless at political action and have to stake their hopes of living satisfying, hobbity lives on a hobbit-friendly group of elves taking power (aristocracy).  So much for having an impact on events.  Maybe I should just tend my garden.  
  
But I thought about it more, and realized that I&#39;m solidly in the blue tribe.  Despite holding reactionary, anti-enlightenment political views and being a practicing Catholic, I&#39;ve lived in blue cities and around blue tribers most of my adult life.  It&#39;s where the money is, the power is, the cultural ferment, the dynamism.  Even after having kids and moving to a red area, my social circle is blue/purple and the industry I work in is dark blue, and I have trouble connecting with my red tribe neighbors on a deep level.  
  
What to do when your fellow tribe members are ideological opponents and your ideological allies are culturally alien?  I want to move to a clandestine dark elven community deep in the red state of Mirkwood where I can join a reactionary book club, go to weekly Mass, go to a climbing gym, and enjoy craft beer.  I want the blue tribe, right-wing cultural and intellectual ferment diffused to near-insubstantiality across the online right to be concentrated into one place so that it can start to do things and develop ideas and put them into practice.  I know I&#39;m not the only one out there, and that hobbits would love to be ruled by this sort of dark elven elite (at least compared to the current elite), so this seems like a huge market failure.
  
Why is this?  There seems to be a lot of dissident right wing energy out there -- why are no centers of intellectual activity forming?  Leftist movements seemed quite good at condensing political energy, historically. Certain cities or regions became centers of union/socialist/communist activity, and from that power base these movements were able to exert political pressure and score victories.  Red tribe right-wingers, hobbits, just want to grill -- they&#39;re not about to get politically active unless their families are threatened.  But blue tribe right-wing dark elves have much in common with blue tribe leftists.  So why is there no organizing impulse amongst the dark elves?  Fear of retaliation from the elven elite?  Perhaps it&#39;s all just a LARP? Something else?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih4l4i1/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1tvj2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] **Black and Brown Americans**

This is a phrase that gets used a lot, but I recently started to wonder how Hispanic Americans think about it?

With Black Americans, the term might not be everyone&#39;s preferred one, with some folks preferring African American, and some others (mostly younger) preferring Person of Color. But, the term Black seems to have a generally positive connotation and plenty of people are happy to use it.

You get slogans like &#34;Black and proud,&#34; &#34;Black is beautiful,&#34; and &#34;Strong Black man.&#34;

Meanwhile, I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve ever heard a Hispanic person refer to themselves as &#34;Brown&#34; or a &#34;Brown American.&#34; I seem to only hear &#34;Brown&#34; used in the phrase &#34;Black and Brown.&#34; It&#39;ll be in things like &#34;Police violence against Black and Brown people&#34; but never &#34;The Brown vote is central to winning the Nevada primary.&#34; That&#39;d be the Hispanic vote.

In fact, I think if you called a Hispanic person &#34;Brown&#34; to their face, you&#39;d better brace yourself for a slap. There&#39;s no positive connotation to it, quite the opposite, and the word would seem to feed into negative stereotypes about Hispanic people (brown being associated with dirt and shit).

No real question here, just musing.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1tvj2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih1pz9v/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Are salt intake guidelines too low?

The FDA recommends eating less than a teaspoon of salt per day, while animals our size generally eat a quarter to a third of an oz per day.  
I don&#39;t eat any processed food, so the only salt I get is on meat and fried eggs. Have been developing salt cravings this summer to the point that livestock mineral salt looks really delicious, which is a pretty reliable sign I&#39;m missing _something_.   
Everything out there is just yelling at people not to eat salt, but maybe someone here has done some proper research?

&amp;gt;if fathers were generally better than children, we should have long since reached that last grade of badness beyond which it is impossible to grow worse.

This is flawed reasoning. There is one respect in which we know with certainty that fathers are generally ~~worse~~ better than their children: the quality of their genes. The average person has more deleterious genetic variants than his parents. Natural selection prevents this effect from compounding each generation by causing people with better genes to have more children, so that the probability distribution of who a random person&#39;s parents are has better average genes than a random sampling of that generation.

Similarly with culture, there could be some kind of selection effect countering actual cultural decline that is happening on some level.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1o33s/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1lzfu/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] The new Labor government in Australia is showing that it wants to distance itsel</title><updated>2022-07-21T12:54:31Z</updated><author><name>AshLael</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">The new Labor government in Australia is showing that it wants to distance itself from the more extravagant excesses of the left: [Government forms have been changed to replace the term &#34;birthing parent&#34; with &#34;mother&#34;.](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/21/bill-shorten-intervenes-to-remove-birthing-parent-from-medical-forms-amid-criticism-in-daily-telegraph)

It&#39;s not a big deal, just a few words on a form. But it&#39;s a clear indication - along with other moves, such as their point blank refusal to entertain lifting their emissions reduction targets - that Albanese&#39;s government, for now at least, wants to continue the moderate, centrist approach that won them power rather than giving their progressive supporters everything they want.

It&#39;s also a further indication that a left wing party that is serious about winning and holding power sees pro-trans language as a loser.

This seems to combine the unique weaknesses of both publicly available AI text generation and &#39;cancel culture&#39;. For the former, the weakness is that, while you can generate text that sounds reasonable at a first glance from someone who knows nothing about the subject, the actual, factual details are all wrong. For the latter, the weakness is a lack of due diligence in assessing the validity of claims of discrimination. Cancel first, think later. (Edit to clarify: I mention all this to make a comparison. I think this method would be far less successful at faking other forms of customer complaints, like asking for refunds, because they would face scrutiny which would reveal incorrect information)

It&#39;s very easy to exploit a zero tolerance attitude towards racism with vexatious accusations, and the technology to carry it out automatically seemingly already exists, waiting for someone to glue the pieces together with a little bit of code and start pointing it at targets.

If the judge rejects the machine’s recommendation, the machine demands a written explanation for records and auditing.&#34;

As I understand, Chinese judicial system is more similar to the Russian system: weak cases are dropped by the prosecution before the trial and the trial is more about the sentencing severity than the determination of guilt: the defense submits every extenuating circumstance, the prosecution submits every aggravating circumstance, the judge finds the person guilty and comes up with an appropriate sentence. If this is the case, then pattern-matching the punishment to similar cases from across the country might actually not be a bad band-aid, it will prevent judges from passing sentences that are too lenient or too harsh due to some bias.

For example, an AI like this could ensure that no implicit racial bias affects the sentencing. But there&#39;s always the risk the knobs of the AI can be fiddled with. What if, in the name of equity, the AI will insist on more lenient sentences if the person is BIPoC? Even if a principled judge keeps writing written explanations of why he agreed with Billy Bob&#39;s and Libby Mae&#39;s sentences, but increased Tyrone&#39;s and Shaneequa&#39;s, she or he will sooner or later be crucified in the media as a &#34;racist judge&#34;.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih0wtcs/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igzkw9e/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW]  A post from u/buttfaceszn put into words something I&#39;ve been processing for a l</title><updated>2022-07-21T00:36:52Z</updated><author><name>productiveaccount1</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text"> A post from u/buttfaceszn put into words something I&#39;ve been processing for a long time. This has nothing to do with incels, sexism, or anything else in comment made by u/buttfaceszn. It&#39;s about how the evolution of our language has played a huge role in our division as a society. I&#39;m only speaking to my experience as an American but I&#39;m sure this isn&#39;t unique to us. 

TL;DR: We need to stop using extremist language and start defining our terms.

From u/buttfaceszn:

&amp;gt;I’ve noticed that the term incel has begun to be used as more of a catchall pejorative for sexism of any kind (at least on the internet) which strikes me as odd. I don’t really like when people use the term incel as an insult to people who bring up redpill/PUA/manosphere-type things, since I suspect there’s a lot of non-incels who find these things interesting and I personally think some of it has value.

u/buttfaceszn is right: Using extreme, specific language to describe tamer things is annoying at best and destructive at worst. To illustrate, let&#39;s change the subject of this comment to reflect how each American party often characterizes each other&#39;s views:

&amp;gt;I’ve noticed that the term (Fascism/Wokeism) has begun to be used as more of a catchall pejorative for (Conservatism/Liberalism) of any kind (at least on the internet) which strikes me as odd. I don’t really like when people use the term (Fascism/Wokeism) as an insult to people who bring up (Right-wing/Left wing) things, since I suspect there’s a lot of non-(Fascists/Wokies) who find these things interesting and I personally think some of it has value.

You get the idea - you could throw pretty much any culture war issue into this statement and it would work pretty well. For some reason, we&#39;ve started to use the most extreme, niche, and damaging words to describe anything that could remotely fall under its umbrella. Trump is a white supremacist, AOC is a literal communist, Gwyneth Paltrow is a scamming, elitist narcissist (unless...). The reasons as to why this is bad are obvious and I think we all agree that we shouldn&#39;t do it. But even in this sub people fling out loaded political buzzwords as if they&#39;re nothing all the time. Is our divisive language simply a sign of the division in our minds? Or does language start to create that barrier in the first place?

According to Fitbit my resting heart rate is already 10bpm lower, and my HRV is 20ms+ higher.

I’ve tried to quit numerous times but I think this is the actual time. I’m just tired of feeling like dog shit most of the time. I’m tired and haven’t been exercising like I used to.

Vaping was always dumb, I don’t even want that in my life. But I can’t resist it when I’m drunk, and I’m always around it, so I ended up just doing it by default.

Alcohol is mostly just nice because it’s weird to not drink, at least in my friend group. So it’s just avoiding that whole awkwardness. But, it does seem like it’s getting more common to encounter people who don’t drink. Maybe that’s just because I’m getting older. In any case, I’m starting to give less of a fuck about that. Just let me live my life, I don’t need to put garbage in my body just to make you feel better.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/igyyi6u/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igyr7zl/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] How about a post on some recent Congressional legislation?

---

The House of Representatives has now passed two bills aimed at protecting abortion rights. 

The first is the [Women&#39;s Health Protection Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3755/text). This bill basically sets out a list of reasons why abortions may not be restricted and creates a test for what future reasons will be prohibited by the law. It targets pretty directly laws various Republican states passed when *Roe* was still in effect to limit abortion. It empowers both the US Attorney General and private parties (including those seeking abortions and those providing them) to sue to enforce the law.

The second of these is the [Ensuring Women’s Right to Reproductive Freedom Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8297/text?r=1&amp;amp;s=1). This law creates liability (enforced by either the Attorney General or private citizens) for anyone acting under color of State law who tries to prevent someone from traveling interstate for the purpose of getting an abortion that would be legal in the state they are going to have it done in.

Both bills passed the House with all but one Democrat in favor and all Republicans against.

Both bills are most likely dead on arrival in the Senate.

---

On Tuesday the House of Representatives also passed the [Respect For Marriage Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8404/text) which enshrines, not [*Obergefell v. Hodges*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) but rather [*United States v. Windsor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor) into federal law. The law does not require that states perform either same sex or interracial marriages but it does require they recognize those marriages if performed in other states where they are legal. It is also enforceable by either the Attorney General or a private right of action. The law also clarifies that the federal definition of marriage includes both interracial and same sex marriages.

Interestingly 47 Republicans (~one-fourth of the caucus) joined the Democrats in passing the bill. If a similar fraction of Senate Republicans support the bill that would be sufficient to invoke cloture and pass it.

---

Finally, introduced today by a bipartisan group of Senators (but not passed anywhere) is the [Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/electoral_count_reform_and_presidential_transition_improvement_act_of_2022.pdf). Exploitation of some ambiguity in the 12th amendment and Electoral Count Act (USC 3) were key to John Eastman&#39;s plan for Trump to retain the presidency even after losing the 2020 election. This act is an attempt to remove that ambiguity. The Act does so first by clarifying that state electors are determined by the laws of the state *prior to election day*. This is to prevent state legislatures from changing who the electors are after the vote has happened (unless they delegated themselves that power in advance). The Act also raises the threshold necessary to trigger a vote on an objection from one Senator and one Representative to one-fifth of Senators and Representatives. It also clarifies the grounds on which electors may be objected to. Finally it clarifies that the role of the President of the Senate is ministerial only and sets up an expedited legal process (three judge panel, then SCOTUS) for hearing challenges to election certification.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igyr7zl/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/igym84d/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Any advice for joint issues?

&amp;gt;of, relating to, or being the sex that typically has the capacity to bear young or produce eggs

The second one is different:

&amp;gt;having a gender identity that is the opposite of male

The definitions for male are similar. First:

&amp;gt;of, relating to, or being the sex that typically has the capacity to produce relatively small, usually motile gametes which fertilize the eggs of a female

Second:

&amp;gt;having a gender identity that is the opposite of female

There are more definitions provided, but all of them use the words &#34;woman,&#34; &#34;girl,&#34; or &#34;female&#34; (or are defining about the word in a different sense, like a female rhyme or a female connector) so they don&#39;t tell us anything about what it actually means to be female, since the definitions of &#34;woman&#34; and &#34;girl&#34; both use the word &#34;female.&#34;

The definition of gender identity is 

&amp;gt;a person&#39;s internal sense of being male, female, some combination of male and female, or neither male nor female

The first definitions are obviously hateful and transphobic, so let&#39;s throw those out. If someone who didn&#39;t know what male, female, and gender identity were wanted to use the definitions to figure out what female meant, they would learn that being female means &#34;having an internal sense of being that is the opposite of the opposite of female.&#34; 

That&#39;s basically a long way to say that &#34;female&#34; means female. We learn from these definitions that male and female are gender identities that are opposed to each other, but we learn nothing about what the difference between them actually is or even what gender identity really means other than that it&#39;s an &#34;internal sense&#34; of some kind. The concepts are connected to each other while floating in the ether, unconnected to physical reality or to any non-gender concepts. This is the form gender ideology always takes when you scratch it even a little bit, circular definitions with no connection to reality. Merriam-Webster avoided the simplest one (&#34;A woman is someone who identifies as someone who identifies...&#34;) by adding more steps but the result, ultimately, is the same.

The only way to give these any kind of meaning is if you sometimes use the second definition and sometimes the first. If you interpret female as meaning &#34;having a gender identity that is the sex that typically has the capacity to bear young or produce eggs&#34;, then you&#39;ve come to something sort of like the understanding of the meaning of the word that progressives actually use. But to get to this definition, female has to mean *both* the second definition *and* the first definition at the *same time*, in the context of the *same statement*, even though these definitions contradict each other (e.g. Lia Thomas is only female by the second definition). 

This contradiction takes other forms, like how trans activists simultaneously insist that having a penis has nothing at all to do with being male at the same time that they insist that surgeries to fabricate a fake penis for someone who doesn&#39;t have a real penis are absolutely vital for some males in order to truly live out their gender identity. Penises are simultaneously completely irrelevant and absolutely vital to male identity. 

To believe in gender identity you have to simultaneously believe two contradictory things (that penises make someone male and that they don&#39;t). It&#39;s trite, but I don&#39;t know what to compare this to other than Orwell&#39;s doublethink.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igy93di/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igy0k3k/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] **Semi-regular Ban Report**

Recently there was a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/ifl02lf/) talking about how; now that covid restrictions are mostly done with; covid is not something most people really think or talk about. But, there are still two groups of people who continue to talk about covid. Those who were really scared and still are, and the &#34;skeptics&#34;. The post somewhat implied that both groups are extremist in some way or the other on the issue of covid. 

I will try to defend my case on why I think my position of being a skeptic should have been the default position. And the fact it wasn&#39;t requires some heavy investigation as to why.

_____________________________________________________________

As a &#34;covid skeptic&#34; much of the discourse around covid restrictions makes me feel like I am being &#39;gaslighted&#39; on a grand level. The jist of it being that I operated under one overton window, one epistemology my entire life and both those things get radically shifted and transformed in 2 years and everyone is suddenly on board, and I am the crazy one for asking &#34;wait what about everything we knew before?&#34;? 

To put it shortly there have been shifts on multiple overton windows in ways that are not conductive to a epistemologycally and politically healthy society and somebody has to acknowledge and speak about it. And continue speaking about it, because some of these shifts pave the way for tremendous injustices. 

Here are the reasons why I will keep talking about covid for the rest of my life. And I will not be convinced I am crazy or of a certain ideological group because I do so. I believe the ones who are not talking about these things have had the cloak successfully put over their eyes (even if they are otherwise skeptics), they forgave what was done to them after it wasn&#39;t being done anymore, they are complacent.

1. Being a &#34;covid skeptic&#34; is the default position of almost all societies before 2020. It was the medical consensus that;
 * Lockdowns are not worth it (QALY,$, &#34;human rights&#34; ) for the vast majority of diseases. The ones that pose an IFR high enough to justify them are not that scary because they also tend to be non contagious for various reasons. 
What was  essentially considered putting entire cities or countries of people under house arrest suddenly became the default mode of addressing the problem? 
 * Universal masking is ineffective for airborne diseases.
 * Vaccinating the entire population by threatening the loss of education/work is by the State is overstepping the bounds by any reasonable western State. 

 The first two points are correct. They were reached after decades of &#34;good science&#34;. The bullshit ideological science (along with all sorts of publication bias and a thousand other traps) peddled to make it seem that lockdowns are worth it and masks work are the work of pure propaganda. We can&#39;t just let that slide right? If &#34;mistakes&#34; were made, they need to be discussed and analyzed lest they not be repeated. 

 We can&#39;t just replace the field of public health which is fundamentally based on the idea of a cost benefit analysis with some idiotic throw EVERYTHING at the wall and hope it works at whatever costs method right? More importantly we can&#39;t have this &#34;philosophy&#34; wear the skin-suit of what it replaced and pretend to be something it is not, rational. Least of all this needs to be discussed. 

2.  The much obvious economic malign caused by covid policies are blamed on &#34;supply chain issues&#34;,&#34;Ukraine war&#34;, &#34;general economic turmoil&#34;, etc. Why is no one talking about the elephant in the room when it comes to economic downturn?

	Really? Lockdowns and travel bans and printing all that money had nothing to do with the inflation and economic struggles? Why is no one discussing the policies that literally consisted of shutting down economies not having an effect when economies are shutting down? Would Sri Lanka be where it is today if not for travel bans and lockdowns? 

	In a recent [video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxdHm2dmvKE) by Jordan Peterson. He posits that perhaps the Russian invasion of Ukraine was in part caused by covid restrictions, as some far out there nth order effect. That world leaders being isolated from each other in person for nearing two years might have been a straw that broke the camels back. Even if this sounds like a far reaching judgement on the surface, is it not more far reaching to assert that two years of lockdowns, mandates, minimized travel, and all its social and economic malaise would not manifest at the margins?

      What about an easier to digest example? The mass shootings in the US? They must be at least slightly correlated with the declining social and economic environment right? Why is no one talking about how further isolating and economically straining those on the margins of shooting up a school going to make them do it? Hell I wanted to cause mayhem as I was locked up in my room (don&#39;t live in the US) for 2 months on end. 

3. The overton window has been shifted significantly towards authoritarianism. We expected the government to play God and deal with nature in 2020 and they let us have our cake, they gladly played as the Gods people wanted them to play so desperately. As a libertarian I don&#39;t think this is a good development.  

	 Did we really expect the governments to do everything they did in 2020 for diseases of the past. They were given the right to put people under house arrest for arbitrary levels of disease depending on time and place. This is a terrible precedent. Will this increased state power never be used for stamping out dissent in the future? 

____________________________________________________________________

To further add on. This whole covid debate left me with a tremendous hate towards &#34;normies&#34;. Many of them felt the same as me. They knew masking 24/7 was stupid. They knew 20 year olds being forced to be vaccinated was unjust. They knew lockdowns would destroy everything. They were still compliant. They had their fun time at home binging netflix and making sourdough bread (as they lost their jobs because of lockdowns). They wore the masks dutifully under their nose. They got vaccinated because &#34;its just less hassle&#34;, etc. Fuck them.

Maybe I have the temperament of a rabid dog who absolutely won&#39;t do something if he thinks its stupid or performative or doesn&#39;t want to do it. Perhaps. But if more people were like me, No one would have complied with lockdown orders, what would they have done? Arrest all of us?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igwztcg/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igu416v/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Ukraine war updates

This is a slow grinding war of Artillery trenches and drone scouting. Ever since Gennady took over Russia has been steadily and slowly taking ground on [june 19th](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-june-19) Lysanchansk was the frontline and now on [July 18](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-july-18) Lysanchansk is firmly in russian territory and the new frontline is Bakhmut. One major issue with reporting on this war is that it&#39;s pretty hard to report on a war where most of the conflict is 50000 artillery shells a day (no seriously) getting fired into a fairly small area followed by a small advance and more artillery. Perhaps the best way to find shelling information is [Thermal anomaly](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#t:adv;d:7days;l:noaa20-viirs,viirs,modis_a,modis_t,street;@37.8,48.1,7z) data because a large scale artillery campaign is visible from such data.

Perhaps the best breakdown I could find of the Ukraine war comes from the [Austrian Military academy](https://youtu.be/dEbLuAPobao) showing just how russian progress has been (slow methodical but definitely moving forward). The grinding down of the Ukrainian forces has been steady, with the UKR forces going from 81 Battallions to 60 while the russians have gone from 93 BTG&#39;s to 108 after new reinforcements. (though remember that it&#39;s hard to assess the strength of the BTGs) While Thermal anomaly data definitely showed that new NATO weapons had a temporary decrease in russian effectiveness the data appears to show that russian artillery shelling has come back after the operational pause for (what appears to be) logistical reasons.

New NATO weapons are probably going to make an impact, though given that the US has sent roughly $7 Billion worth of equipment to UKR it&#39;s hard to say how much each marginal unit enables. Remember this is also NATO $7 billion so while the weapons work they&#39;re not necessarily very good in the &#34;bang for the buck&#34; department. In the report by Mr.Resner it&#39;s pointed out that the M777 is really vulnerable to damage from Shrapnel, and needs constant repairs to maintain it&#39;s combat effectiveness. 
.
.I keep getting conflicting reports on air defenses, it appears that Ukrianian air defenses are good enough to prevent bombing but they have no defense against air to ground long range missiles., though it appears such ATG missiles aren&#39;t very cost effective. 

I know reporting on what has become World war 1 with drones is a little boring, but still I&#39;m surprised at how little discussion there is about the only political event to actually remain relevant 5 months after it started in 2022.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igu416v/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/igu27zk/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] So who has watched the first episode of Nathan Fielder&#39;s new HBO show The Rehear</title><updated>2022-07-19T21:39:26Z</updated><author><name>Fruckbucklington</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">So who has watched the first episode of Nathan Fielder&#39;s new HBO show The Rehearsal?

So naturally, when I heard about [a new study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(22\)00847-9/fulltext) out on the impact of alcohol on health and read a couple [news articles](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/14/alcohol-is-never-good-for-people-under-40-global-study-finds) on it, my first instinct was to be similarly scathing regarding the quality of evidence and the reporting thereof. Instead of that though, I want to step back and try to tease apart just how different it is to evaluate that evidence from a public health lens and a personal advice lens. For the moment, let&#39;s assume that the quality of data and imputed causal relationships are basically valid and use them as a jumping off point:

&amp;gt;The study, published in the Lancet, found that 59% of those who drank harmful amounts were aged 15-39 – people for whom alcohol provided no health benefit and posed risks, including injuries relating to drinking or car accidents, suicides or murders.

I probably do buy that straightaway - I would bet a fair bit that drinkers are more likely to be in car accidents, commit murder, or kill themselves. From a public health perspective, this is at least suggestive of a plausible causal relationship, even if it doesn&#39;t really provide the necessary evidence to legitimize compulsory policies without randomized control trials to accumulate better evidence going forward. 

On the flip side though, should this tell me, a guy in my thirties that probably does drink a bit too much, much of anything about the likely impact on my longevity? Does it make me more inclined to suggest to friends that they cut back or stop drinking altogether? My immediate inclination is to think that my risk of car accidents, suicides, and murders are changed by a rounding error by drinking, even by drinking heavily - I don&#39;t drink and drive, I&#39;ve never had a remotely suicidal impulse, and I&#39;m a pretty non-violent guy that doesn&#39;t carry a weapon. *Maybe* there&#39;s some marginal change, but it&#39;s not much. What about my advice for others? Well, I suppose I can&#39;t know their inner state as well - some people are visibly sullen or violent when drinking, so it might be best for them to knock it off. I have no way to weight the benefits for others accurately, but I personally gain quite a bit of joy from the culture and experience of good beers and bourbons and do not suffer any apparent emotional or material impacts on my life.

This isn&#39;t really about alcohol though (although I do invite commentary on that), it&#39;s about how the reactions of public health people. The policy people say things like:

&amp;gt;Dr Richard Piper, chief executive of Alcohol Change UK, said: “The emerging science on alcohol, over hundreds of studies over the past 20 years, is telling us very clearly that alcohol is very damaging to the human body in multiple ways. We were previously unaware of this, and too many of us continue to drink as though this revolution in our knowledge hasn’t happened.

&amp;gt;“If you care about your health, by far the best approach is not to drink at all. If you do choose to drink alcohol, listen properly to the UK’s chief medical officers, and do not exceed 14 units a week (about six pints of lager or a bottle and a half of wine), have at least three alcohol-free days a week, and never exceed more than six units in one day.”

The closing paragraph of the linked Lancet study includes:

&amp;gt;The findings of this study support the development of tailored guidelines and recommendations on alcohol consumption by age and across regions and highlight that existing low consumption thresholds are too high for younger populations in all regions. Additionally, our results suggest that guidelines should not incorporate sex-specific recommendations, given the absence of variation in TMREL and NDE by sex across geographies and locations. Finally, recognising that the majority of the world&#39;s population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol are young adults and predominantly young males, in order to minimise health loss due to alcohol consumption it is important to prioritise interventions targeted at these demographic groups.

The thing about public health is that it&#39;s inherently a fairly blunt instrument. If the appropriate conclusion is that many people drink too much, resulting in them causing carnage to the tune of thousands of gruesome excess deaths among the young annually from car accidents, suicides, and homicides, it&#39;s pretty rational for the policy people to start thinking about how to get people to drink less. They generally can&#39;t afford to undercut their message by hedging and saying, &#34;well, ya know, unless you&#39;re just not going to kill yourself, then it doesn&#39;t matter much&#34;.

As a final thought, it&#39;s still worth taking a swipe at the journalists - &#34;Alcohol is never good for people under 40, global study finds&#34; is just an absolutely shit summary of the finding.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igtkil9/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igt16bp/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] An update on [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_wa</title><updated>2022-07-19T17:47:44Z</updated><author><name>badnewsbandit</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">An update on [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifzejpk/) story from last week. [Charges against Jose Alba dismissed](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-charges-dismissed-harlem-bodega-worker-jose-alba-20220719-wpukj3ga2zfrdgomjh7efybbke-story.html).
&amp;gt;Prosecutors said Alba had at least two strong self-defense arguments to pursue: That he feared Simon might kill him, and that he believed Simon was committing a burglary by stepping behind the counter without permission.

...
&amp;gt;But other facts of the case weighed in Alba’s favor, the prosecutor wrote. Simon was 26 years younger than Alba and five inches taller. The bodega clerk is 5-foot-7.

&amp;gt;“Simon’s conduct in entering the store’s small, private area, throwing Alba against the wall to a place he could not escape, and grabbing him by the collar could inspire deep fear in an older and shorter man as to what might be in store next,“ Sigall wrote.

&amp;gt;Sigall added, “This was also in the context of the girlfriend saying five minutes earlier that her boyfriend was going to “come down here right now and f--- you up.”

Much that seems inline with various comments noting the physical disparity between the two men and how that might factor into a self-defense claim as well as the initial remarks from the girlfriend threatening Alba and their impacts on self-defense/robbery.

Initially I was a bit confused about the prosecutors in dismissing the case saying they didn&#39;t think they could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Alba was not justified but apparently in New York, self defense is a [justification](https://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article35.php#p35.00) not an affirmative defense which balances things much more in favor of the defendant.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igt16bp/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igsz3wz/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] The first hearing in Twitter&#39;s lawsuit against Elon Musk for specific performanc</title><updated>2022-07-19T17:35:01Z</updated><author><name>Hailanathema</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">The first hearing in Twitter&#39;s lawsuit against Elon Musk for specific performance was today. This hearing wasn&#39;t about any merits issues for the case but was more about scheduling when the trial will take place. I was unable to tune in for most of the hearing, I only caught the judge&#39;s opinion at the end but I know a [couple](https://twitter.com/AkivaMCohen/status/1549403466036117504) lawyers who [live-tweeted](https://twitter.com/Kolyin/status/1549407533269504002) it. You can read Musk&#39;s opposition to Twitter&#39;s motion to expedite [here](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/07/18/twitter-vs-musk-musks-opposition-to-expedited-proceedings/) and Twitter&#39;s reply to Musk&#39;s opposition [here](https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=308108891&amp;amp;z=0555e1b7).

The short version is that Twitter wanted a trial in September. This is not *unprecedented* in Delaware courts but it is a very aggressive schedule. Musk wanted a date *next February* which, while also not unprecedented, is much longer than these actions typically take. The Court split the difference (not really) and set the trial for five days in October. This seems to bode pretty poorly for Musk, assuming all the time he wanted before the trial is time he thought he would actually need.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igsz3wz/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igsmj99/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] The UK conservative party will soon pick another leader who will automatically b</title><updated>2022-07-19T16:17:02Z</updated><author><name>sargon66</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">The UK conservative party will soon pick another leader who will automatically become Prime Minister.  [Betting markets](https://electionbettingodds.com/NextUKConservativeLeader2022.html) give Liz Truss a 47% chance of winning and Penny Mordaunt an 12% chance.

Dominic Cummings (rationalist, Brexit Mastermind, and former top adviser to Boris Johnson) [writes](https://dominiccummings.substack.com/p/snippets-6-the-leadership-race-sw1?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email):

&amp;gt; PennyM is a true idiot. She would be total fiasco as PM

&amp;gt; LizzT is a bit less stupid but much more crackers and would also be a total fiasco.

&amp;gt; Either of them would not just fail, they could destroy the party. Which means that many will be cheering for one of them.

&amp;gt; Boris is supporting Truss. Why? 1) He thinks it’s the best way to stop Sunak. 2) He knows Truss is mad as a box of snakes and is thinking, ‘there’s a chance she blows, there’s another contest and I can return’.

&amp;gt; And with the human handgrenade [LizzT], she may catastrophically escalate the war — remember she has defined the goal as pushing Russia out of Crimea, which if seriously attempted would be seen by the vast majority of Russians Iincluding anti-Putin Russians) as an attempt to destroy Russia and could lead to nuclear weapons.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igsmj99/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igrrykb/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] [removed]</title><updated>2022-07-19T12:46:32Z</updated><author><name>[deleted]</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">[removed]</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igrrykb/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igqxz7m/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] I’ve noticed that the term incel has begun to be used as more of a catchall pejo</title><updated>2022-07-19T06:54:33Z</updated><author><name>buttfaceszn</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">I’ve noticed that the term incel has begun to be used as more of a catchall pejorative for sexism of any kind (at least on the internet) which strikes me as odd. I don’t really like when people use the term incel as an insult to people who bring up redpill/PUA/manosphere-type things, since I suspect there’s a lot of non-incels who find these things interesting and I personally think some of it has value. But from the perspective of someone who is trying to insult a redpill/MRA type in a heated Reddit argument, it at least makes sense to call them an incel. Incels afaik do really tend to be into these ideas, and people who excessively harp on them can come across as resentful about their own personal struggles with women.  

What’s odd to me is when I’ve seen it used to describe people who make fun of the WNBA, or say that women shouldn’t be NFL coaches, or don’t like women comedians, or make banal observations about women being more sensitive or dramatic or whichever stereotype. The reason it’s odd is that in my experience, low-level sexism or observations/jokes about sex differences are extremely common, even more so among guys who are typically successful with women. I suspect I have a relatively more “normie” upbringing than the typical commenter here, I played sports like football and baseball in high school, went to a good but not elite large public university, was in a social fraternity, and have many uncles and cousins who are all blue-collar tradesmen types. I can’t think of anyone I am close with from sports, HS, college, family, etc. who has had any trouble with women, and definitely none who are redpill types or incels.  

My whole life, among men of all ages, races, incomes etc. it seems like it’s extremely common to be “casually sexist”. Making “women be shopping”-tier observations about gender differences, or saying women are more [insert stereotype] is very normal, and some more mean-spirited or harmful things like making fun of the WNBA, or saying women couldn’t be NFL coaches, or calling certain women “gold-diggers” wouldn’t be uncommon. It also seems common for my girlfriend or my mom and their friends to make similar observations about men, calling them clueless or lazy or unable to pick up on social cues or not knowing what to do with babies. It also seems these kinds of jokes or observations were popular in sitcoms and comedy movies in the past. It just seems odd to me that this kind of thing would come to be associated with “guys who can’t get laid”, especially since it seems like misogyny/sexism is also somewhat associated with the jock/frat bro stereotype. 

I’m not trying to argue whether any of this is good or true or sexist or not. It just always seemed like it was relatively common to me and mostly lighthearted. (I also don’t want to argue whether casual sexism is *harmful* I am just saying the things I am describing aren’t *intended* to be *hateful*).  

I guess my questions are: am I correct that this is normal or am I in a particularly sexist bubble? Was it normal in the past, but isn’t anymore? Or am I just overthinking this, and random people on the internet are just using incel to mean “vaguely sexist” without really caring about being accurate? I suspect it’s the last one and potentially a mix of the other two, but I do wonder if there is a genuine taboo-ing of even the most harmless kinds of gender-stereotype humor among younger generations. Or possibly: I am I just way off on where the line is between “casual/acceptable/normal” level sexism, and something like “making fun of the WNBA” is more in the “hateful towards women” category of sexism?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igqxz7m/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igq8pkg/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] What does Napoleon tell us about ideology?

I think finally we may be seeing our fist notable, multinational woke undoing. It&#39;s too early to blame wokness for sure, but Disney stock has been doing horribly lately, way worse than the S&amp;amp;P 500. 

Disney is at $95, a 53% decline from its peak just 16 months ago, versus a 20% decline for the S&amp;amp;P 500. Moreover, Disney stock is unchanged since early 2015, lagging the S&amp;amp;P 500 considerably there too. 

This difference is huge:  over the past 5 years the S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 56% (excluding dividends) but Disney is down 11%

In this post I argue that America&#39;s political problems and division, in spite of social media outrage, are low stakes historically speaking. America&#39;s biggest rivals, China and Russia, are also quite weak too even compared to the Cold War.

&amp;gt;Or like the second half of the 20th century, which witnessed several assassinations of statesmen and other important people, including John and Robert Kennedy, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr., and also the attempted assassinations of Pope John Paul II and Ronald Reagan, in addition to the civil rights movement, the South flipping from Blue to Red, and endless crime waves and race riots that continued until the mid 90s, when crime finally began to fall. Regarding Roe v. Wade, unlike the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, there has been close to zero civil disobedience regarding abortion rights. The BLM riots of 2020, as bad as those were, had far far fewer deaths and injuries compared to the Rodney King riots. Jan 6th is not like 911, as much as the left wishes it was. Yeah, there is a lot of societal decay, such as homelessness and drug use, but this is not destabilizing, nor will it lead to unrest. Elites will continue to retreat from everyone else and the decay, forming their own enclaves and close-knit communities.

I think Pinker&#39;s  [Long Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Peace) thesis is still intact even though things may seem worse, thanks to social media , which has the effect of amplifying bad news, so it&#39;s hard to look at things in the correct context.  Thanks to social media, every small or isolated event of unrest is broadcast worldwide to billions of people in real time, whereas 40+ years ago similar events would have gone ignored or only mentioned in passing in a local newspaper.  Russia&#39;s war with Ukraine does not threaten this post-ww2 geopolitical &#39;order&#39;. Compared to the conflicts of Vietnam, WW2, or even the Yugoslav Wars, the Russian-Ukraine war doesn&#39;t  even measure up to a single battle of WW2, let alone the entire thing.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igpi2uj/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igph8wf/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Rightists are not put-upon victims nor the innocent objects of left-wing mendaci</title><updated>2022-07-18T23:20:46Z</updated><author><name>Extrayesorno</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Rightists are not put-upon victims nor the innocent objects of left-wing mendacity. 

This framing pops up again and again, [here&#39;s an example from a few hours ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igotl8u/) that inspired this comment. 

The idea is that the left is just pushing *too far* and if leftists had been a bit more charitable or a bit more reasonable, then rightists would have been happy to compromise. Explicit or implicit is a historical fantasy where the right was sitting passively until the left showed up and tried to implement some change, which the right happily (or at least agreeably) permitted. But then the left just *kept pushing* until the right, like a beaten dog, was finally forced to bite back.

This is, indeed, fantasy. No left-wing policy, law, program, or ideal has ever been put through except in the teeth of right-wing opposition. Nothing from the decriminalization of sodomy, to desegregation, to women&#39;s suffrage, to universal *male* suffrage, to the abolition of slavery (that one necessitated a military defeat, and even then the rebels were whining that they were only fighting this war because the damned abolitionist fanatics had pushed them to it) has been gotten through except by the defeat of the right, whether that be economic, political, social, or military defeat. 

(As an aside, there are committed reactionaries who will happily admit that they *do* think the decriminalization of homosexuality, women&#39;s suffrage, abolition of slavery, democracy, republicanism, etc. were indeed mistakes, and none of this applies to them, they are at least honest and consistent)

When rightists, historically, has said, &#34;okay, I&#39;ll grant you this one,&#34; they&#39;ve never said it out of magnanimous good-faith, they&#39;ve said it at bayonet-point (literal or metaphorical), when they had *no choice* but to grant it anyways. 

The idea that the right wouldn&#39;t be so angry and would have been happy if we hadn&#39;t just kept pushing has always been nonsense, and the right has never been a hapless victim, but rather an enemy on the back foot. 

Any leftist or liberal who is tempted to buy this rightist line of &#34;hey, we would have been glad to meet in the middle, you guys just got so *crazy*&#34; and to see the right as victim rather than a (temporarily) weakened foe ought to remember that old fable about the farmgirl and the wounded serpent.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igph8wf/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igoxug5/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] The tactical AAR on the Uvalde school shooting is out, and full of information f</title><updated>2022-07-18T21:05:56Z</updated><author><name>JTarrou</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">The tactical AAR on the Uvalde school shooting is out, and full of information for those who want to dig in deeper.

Some highlights to point out:

&amp;gt;Prior to the suspect’s entry into the building at 11:33:00, a Uvalde Police Officer on scene at the crash site observed the suspect carrying a rifle outside the west hall entry. The officer, armed with a rifle, asked his supervisor for permission to shoot the suspect. However, the supervisor either did not hear or responded too late.

Prior to anyone dying there was an armed police officer on site ~~with a bead on the shooter~~ *after* he had fired on two civilians and into the school from the outside. He did not engage the shooter. Edit: or maybe not, conflicting testimony, see thread below.

&amp;gt;At 11:35:55, all three Uvalde Police Department (UPD) officers entered the structure through the west door into the west hallway. These officers were equipped with the following: one with external armor and two with concealable body armor, two rifles, and three pistols.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;At 11:36:00, four officers entered the south hallway through the south door closest to the suspect. It is not clear what equipment these officers had with them. Four more officers entered the west hallway through the west door at 11:36:03.

Within three minutes of the shooter entering the building, there were at least *eleven* police officers in the building, all with firearms and vests of some sort. At least two, possibly more, had rifles. They do not engage the shooter.

&amp;gt;At 11:38:37, an officer outside of the hallway advises the suspect “is contained.” (BWC)  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;At 11:40:58, the suspect fires 1 round according to audio estimates. (ISS)  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;At 11:41:30, dispatch asked via radio if the door was locked, a UPD officer responds, “I am not  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;sure, but we have a hooligan to break it.” (BWC)  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;At 11:44:00, the suspect fires one more round according to audio estimates. (ISS)  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE ASSESSMENT 8  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;At 11:48:18, a UCISD PD officer enters through the west hallway door and states, “She says she is shot,” referring to his wife. He is escorted outside of the building.

Despite being just behind the shooter, who continues to fire intermittently throughout the standoff, the cops hole up and carefully insert their thumbs deep into their collective rectums.

&amp;gt;At 12:06:16, UPD RL notes that no Command Post is set up, advised bodies needed to keep parents out.

No one is in charge and the only concern of the cops is to keep anyone who might tackle the shooter out of the school, be it their own officer whose wife was at that moment bleeding out mere feet away, or the parents.

&amp;gt;By 12:13:00, dispatchers had received numerous 9-1-1 calls from a child explaining that there were several children and one of her teachers deceased and another teacher hurt in room 112.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;At 12:15:27, it appears tactical team members of United States Border Patrol Tactical Teams (BORTAC) arrive  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;At 12:21:08, four shots are fired by the suspect from within one of the two classrooms. (ISS)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

&amp;gt;From 12:21:16 until 12:34:38, a continuous conversation takes place in the south hallway,  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;involving UCISD PD Chief Arredondo and a UPD officer discussing tactical options and  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;considerations including snipers, windows, and how to get into the classroom. They also discussed  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;who has the keys, testing keys, the probability of the door being locked, and if kids and teachers  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;are dying or dead. (BWC)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

&amp;gt;From 12:37:45 until 12:47:25, UCISD PD Chief Arredondo attempts to negotiate with the suspect, speaking in English and Spanish  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;At 12:50:03, an ad Hoc team assaults room 111, neutralizing the suspect

So that&#39;s the greatest hits of the timeline. To push in on some issues we discussed previously:

Windows:

&amp;gt;The exterior walls of each classroom had two 3’ x 4’ windows near the opposing corners of each classroom (see Figure 3). The bottom of each window was approximately 3’ from interior floor level, and they were equipped with mini blinds. From the exterior, the windows were approximately 4’ from ground level.

So four windows total covering both classrooms, and at a height that a normal size man would have no trouble seeing/shooting through from the outside.

External door:

&amp;gt;on this day the door was not locked, and because it was not locked, the attacker was able to immediately access the building.

Internal door:

&amp;gt;the suspect is seen entering the room, exiting the room, and then reentering the room again prior to officers entering the building at 11:35:55. The only way to engage the lock is to insert a key from the hallway side of the door. At no point is the suspect observed entering the hallway and engaging the locking mechanism. Based upon this, we believe that the lock to room 111 was never engaged.

Jesus H. Shitfucking Christ. Then there&#39;s this gem:

&amp;gt;As noted in Figure 6, there was a window in the center of each classroom door. Officers could have utilized the window to send accurate return fire back at the suspect.

Initial attempt of the police to enter:

&amp;gt;As the officers approached the doors, the suspect began firing.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;This gunfire caused both teams of officers to retreat from the doors. We note that the officers did not make contact with the doors (i.e., they never touched any part of the doors)

This was at the point in time when they had eleven officers with at least two rifles available. Only two officers (one with a rifle) attempted to get to the door, and they both ran away as soon as rounds started coming through the drywall. The &#34;grazing injuries&#34; seem to be fragments of the wood/drywall rather than bullets.

So what should the officers have done, according to the experts?

&amp;gt;Perhaps the simplest plan would have been to push the team back down the hallway and attempt to control the classrooms from the windows in the doors. Any officer wearing rifle rated body armor (e.g., plates) would have assumed the lead as they had an additional level of protection. A team of 4 officers could have utilized the windows in the doors to control a large portion of the classroom from the hallway......  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;If the officers believed that they could not establish control through the doors, they should have found another way to stop the killing and dying. One option would have been to breach the exterior windows of the classrooms.....  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Both options a and b could have been done simultaneously. The window breaks could have been used to signal the start of the assault and draw the suspect’s attention from the doors. The window officers would stay behind the cover of the exterior wall while the door officers had priority of fire. Then the window officers could stand and cover the rest of the room.

Well fuck me running, what sort of tactical genius would it take to have thought of that?

I remembered [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vlopk0/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_june_27_2022/idwelna/) by /u/ZorbaTHut about trying to generalize the problem of (supposedly existing) people who can&#39;t understand conditionals. And I wonder if there&#39;s any connection with inability to understand pointers and recursion by some people described [here](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/). Indirection?

&amp;gt; I’ve come to realize that **understanding pointers in C is not a skill, it’s an aptitude**. In first year computer science classes, there are always about 200 kids at the beginning of the semester, all of whom wrote complex adventure games in BASIC for their PCs when they were 4 years old. They are having a good ol’ time learning C or Pascal in college, until one day the professor introduces pointers, and suddenly, they don’t get it.

&amp;gt; They just don’t understand anything any more. 90% of the class goes off and becomes Political Science majors, then they tell their friends that there weren’t enough good looking members of the appropriate sex in their CompSci classes, that’s why they switched. **For some reason most people seem to be born without the part of the brain that understands pointers. Pointers require a complex form of doubly-indirected thinking that some people just can’t do**, and it’s pretty crucial to good programming. A lot of the “script jocks” who started programming by copying JavaScript snippets into their web pages and went on to learn Perl never learned about pointers, and they can never quite produce code of the quality you need.

&amp;gt; That’s the source of all these famous interview questions you hear about, like “reversing a linked list” or “detect loops in a tree structure.”


Through now that I checked, recursion was already covered in that 4chan post Scott referenced

&amp;gt; Other interesting phenomenon around IQ involves recursion. For example: &#34;Write a story with two named characters, each of whom have at least one line of dialogue.&#34; Most literate people can manage this, especially once you give them an example. &#34;Write a story with two named characters, each of whom have at least one line of dialogue. In this story, one of the characters must be describing a story with at least two named characters, each of whom have at least one line of dialogue.&#34; If you have less than 90 IQ, this second exercise is basically completely impossible. Add a third level (&#39;frame&#39;) to the story, and even IQ 100&#39;s start to get mixed up with the names and who&#39;s talking. Turns out Scheherazade was an IQ test!
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Time is practically impossible to understand for sub 80s. They exist only in the present, can barely reflect on the past and can&#39;t plan for the future at all. Sub 90s struggle with anachronism too. For example, I remember the 80-85s stumbling on logic problems that involved common sense anachronism stuff. For instance: &#34;Why do you think that military strategists in WWII didn&#39;t use laptop computers to help develop their strategies?&#34; &#34;I guess they didn&#39;t want to get hacked by Nazis&#34;. Admittedly you could argue that this is a history knowledge question, not quite a logic sequencing question, but you get the idea. Sequencing is super hard for them to track, but most 100+ have no problem with it, although I imagine that a movie like Memento strains them a little. Recursion was definitely the killer though. Recursive thinking and recursive knowledge seems genuinely hard for people of even average intelligence.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/ignl1wi/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ign9fxu/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Wesley Yang is out with a short [new piece](https://wesleyyang.substack.com/p/ye</title><updated>2022-07-18T14:25:41Z</updated><author><name>Maximum_Publius</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Wesley Yang is out with a short [new piece](https://wesleyyang.substack.com/p/yes-things-are-really-as-bad-as-youve) by a leftie public school teacher who works in a blue state and a blue city but who nonetheless can acknowledge some of the craziness coming out of the woke left these days. Nothing all that new here but it&#39;s nonetheless bracing to be reminded about how deep some woke stuff goes.

The most shocking part:

&amp;gt;&#34;1) I once attended a meeting where we brainstormed strategies to increase AP enrollment. When we moved to discuss the gap in enrollment between Black and white students, a senior teacher said that trying to register more children of color for AP classes is inherently racist and that putting greater value on AP classes at all is an expression of white supremacy. To clarify: I don&#39;t mean that a senior teacher expressed a complex set of ideas regarding racial justice that could be uncharitably reduced to those claims. I mean I sat in a room where a senior teacher literally spoke the words Trying to register more students of color for AP classes is inherently racist and Putting greater value on AP classes at all is an expression of white supremacy, to an audience of other teachers who nodded along or otherwise kept quiet.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;2) I once attended another meeting - lots of meetings when you’re a teacher! - where we were working to approve a new weekly schedule for students. When I said I was concerned that it would require leaving some sections of the curriculum untaught, a colleague said that might actually be a good thing, because most of our students are white and their test scores dropping slightly would help shrink the racial achievement gap in our state. Again, to clarify: I don’t mean my colleague had a a more nuanced approach to testing that a dishonest interlocutor could twist to sound like that. I mean my colleague literally spoke those words. (To be fair, one other teacher did speak up and challenge them this time, albeit very politely.)&#34;

I don&#39;t have a ton to add here. I&#39;ve read dozens if not a 100+ articles like this in the past couple years, but they haven&#39;t stopped getting my blood boiling. What hope is there for a society captured by an ideology like this?

Sometimes I feel a little sad that I haven&#39;t had kids yet (I just turned 30). But then I think: If I had had kids earlier (and when I was more of a true believing leftist), then they would probably have been exposed to this kind of toxicity by now. At least having kids later will mean I&#39;ll know better than to let them into public schools (or for that matter even into most private schools, many of which are also woke-captured sometimes to an even greater degree than public schools).</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ign9fxu/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igmj9y6/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] I&#39;m looking for a study that shows that teaching quality is more important for g</title><updated>2022-07-18T10:20:46Z</updated><author><name>Greenei</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">I&#39;m looking for a study that shows that teaching quality is more important for good students than bad students, i.e. the learning achievements of good students increase more quickly with teacher quality.

For instance, if I am a feminist, it’s important to factor in the fact that people can be reared to value *either* feminist values *or* traditional values. Humans are this malleable, that they can be raised to value particular things according to what they consume and how they model rewards. Men, for instance, can be raised to value the Spartan way of life, the Athenian way of life, or the Puritan way of life. By simply changing some variables we can have people value different things.

This is important, because it means we can just think dispassionately “what is best for the whole of society”, without much care for what people happen to value at this particular point, ourselves included. I have little doubt that if I were born a Spartan I would love war and that if I were born a Puritan I would love prayer. People did not historically deviate from their culture’s values except in times of strong propaganda against the values, eg counterculture 60’s with their strong and vivid media.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igikeu1/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igifq3r/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] How many people here actually own a firearm, and if you don&#39;t mind saying, is it</title><updated>2022-07-17T12:43:00Z</updated><author><name>ChrisPrattAlphaRaptr</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">How many people here actually own a firearm, and if you don&#39;t mind saying, is it a hunting rifle/handgun/AR style whatever?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igifq3r/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ighen4v/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Ahmad ibn Fadlan [recounts the funeral rites of the Varangians](https://ethicsof</title><updated>2022-07-17T04:50:04Z</updated><author><name>CD-ROM_INSTRUCTOR</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">Ahmad ibn Fadlan [recounts the funeral rites of the Varangians](https://ethicsofsuicide.lib.utah.edu/selections/ibn-fadlan/):

&amp;gt; I had been told that when their chieftains died cremation was the least [sic?] part of their whole funeral procedure, and I was, therefore, very much interested to find out more about this.  One day I heard that one of their leaders had died.  They laid him forthwith in a grave which they covered up for ten days till they had finished cutting-out and sewing his costume.  If the dead man is poor they make a little ship, put him in it, and burn it.  If he is wealthy, however, they divide his property and goods into three parts: one for his family, one to pay for his costume, and one to make nabid [probably a Scandinavian type of beer] which they drink on the day when the slave woman of the dead man is killed and burnt together with her master.  They are deeply addicted to nabid, drinking it night and day; and often one of them has been found dead with a beaker in his hand.  When a chieftain among them has died, his family demands of his slave women and servants: ‘Which of you wishes to die with him?’  Then one of them says: ‘I do’; and having said that the person concerned is forced to do so, and no backing out is possible.  Even if he wished to he would not be allowed to.  Those who are willing are mostly the slave women.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; So when this man died they said to his slave women: ‘Which of you wants to die with him?’  One of them answered, ‘I do.’ From that moment she was put in the constant care of two other women servants who took care of her to the extent of washing her feet with their own hands.  They began to get things ready for the dead man, to cut his costume and so on, while every day the doomed woman drank and sang as though in anticipation of a joyous event.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; When the day arrived on which the chieftain and his slave woman were going to be burnt, I went to the river where his ship was moored.  It had been hauled ashore and four posts were made for it of birch and other wood.  Further there was arranged around it what looked like a big store of wood.  Then the ship was hauled near and placed on the wood.  People now began to walk about talking in a language I could not understand, and the corpse still lay in the grave; they had not taken it out.  They then produced a wooden bench, placed it on the ship, and covered it with carpets of Byzantine dibag [painted silk] and with cushions of Byzantine dibag.  Then came an old woman whom they call ‘the Angel of Death’, and she spread these cushions out over the bench.  She was in charge of the whole affair from dressing the corpse to the killing of the slave woman.  I noticed that she was an old giant-woman, a massive and grim figure.  When they came to his grave they removed the earth from the wooden frame and they also took the frame away.  They then divested the corpse of the clothes in which he had died.  The body, I noticed, had turned black because of the intense frost.  When they first put him in the grave, they had also given him beer, fruit, and a lute, all of which they now removed.  Strangely enough the corpse did not smell, nor had anything about him changed save the colour of his flesh.  They now proceeded to dress him in hose, and trousers, boots, coat, and a mantle of dibag adorned with gold buttons; put on his head a cap of dibag and sable fur; and carried him to the tent on the ship, where they put him on the blanket and supported him with cushions.  They then produced nabid, fruit, and aromatic plants, and put these round his body; and they also brought bread, meat, and onions which they flung before him.  Next they took a dog, cut it in half, and flung the pieces into the ship, and after this they took all his weapons and placed them beside him.  Next they brought two horses and ran them about until they were in a sweat, after which they cut them to pieces with swords and flung their meat in to the ship; this also happened to two cows.  Then they produced a cock and a hen, killed them, and threw them in.  Meanwhile the slave woman who wished to be killed walked up and down, going into one tent after the other, and the owner of each tent had sexual intercourse with her, saying: ‘Tell you master I did this out of love for him.’
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; It was now Friday afternoon and they took the slave woman away to something which they had made resembling a doorframe. Then she placed her legs on the palms of the men and reached high enough to look over the frame, and she said something in a foreign language, after which they took her down.  And they lifted her again and she did the same as the first time.  Then they took her down and lifted her a third time and she did the same as the first and the second times.  Then they gave her a chicken and she cut its head off and threw it away; they took the hen and threw it into the ship.  Then I asked the interpreter what she had done.  He answered: ‘The first time they lifted her she said: “Look!  I see my father and mother.”  The second time she said: “Look!  I see all my dead relatives sitting round.”  The third time she said: “Look!  I see my master inParadise, andParadiseis beautiful and green and together with him are men and young boys.  He calls me.  Let me join him then!”’
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; They now led her towards the ship.  Then she took off two bracelets she was wearing and gave them to the old woman, ‘the Angel of Death’, the one who was going to kill her.  She next took off two anklets she was wearing and gave them to the daughters of that woman known by the name ‘the Angel of Death’.  They then led her to the ship but did not allow her inside the tent.  Then a number of men carrying wooden shields and sticks arrived, and gave her a beaker with nabid.  She sang over it and emptied it.  The interpreter then said to me, ‘Now with that she is bidding farewell to all her women friends.’  Then she was given another beaker.  She took it and sang a lengthy song; but the old woman told her to hurry and drink up and enter the tent where her master was.  When I looked at her she seemed completely bewildered.  She wanted to enter the tent and she put her head between it and the ship.  There the woman took her head and managed to get it inside the tent, and the woman herself followed.  Then the men began to beat the shields with the wooden sticks, to deaden her shouts so that the other girls would not become afraid and shrink from dying with their masters.  Six men entered the tent and all of them had intercourse with her.  Therefore they laid her by the side of her dead master.  Two held her hands and two her feet, and the woman called ‘the Angel of Death’ put a cord round the girl’s neck, doubled with an end at each side, and gave it to two men to pull.  Then she advanced holding a small dagger with a broad blade and began to plunge it between the girl’s ribs to and from while the two men choked her with the cord till she died.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; The dead man’s nearest kinsman now appeared.  He took a piece of wood and ignited it.  Then he walked backwards, his back towards the ship and his face towards the crowd, holding the piece of wood in one hand and the other hand on his buttock; and he was naked.  In this way the wood was ignited which they had place under the ship after they had laid the slave woman, whom they had killed, beside her master.  Then people came with branches and wood; each brought a burning brand and threw it on the pyre, so that the fire took hold of the wood, then the ship, then the tent and the man and slave woman and all.  Thereafter a strong and terrible wind rose so that the flame stirred and the fire blazed still more.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; I heard one of the Rus folk, standing by, say something to my interpreter, and when I inquired what he had said, my interpreter answered: ‘He said: “You Arabs are foolish.”’  ‘Why?’  I asked.  ‘Well, because you throw those you love and honour to the ground where the earth and the maggots and fields devour them, whereas we, on the other hand, burn them up quickly and they go toParadisethat very moment.’  The man burst out laughing, and on being asked why, he said: ‘His Lord, out of love for him, has sent this wind to take him away within the hour!’  And so it proved, for within that time the ship and the pyre, the girl and the corpse had all become ashes and then dust.  On the spot where the ship stood after having been hauled ashore, they built something like a round mound.  In the middle of it they raised a large post of birch-wood on which they wrote the names of the dead man and of the king of the Rus, and then the crowd dispersed.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ighen4v/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/igg1gya/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Got an old network attached storage device, HDD-based, that I&#39;d like to securely</title><updated>2022-07-16T21:49:02Z</updated><author><name>[deleted]</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">Got an old network attached storage device, HDD-based, that I&#39;d like to securely erase.

There’s been talk online about [how video games aren’t as fun as they used to be](https://youtu.be/j4QKSCushmo). The ascribed reasons vary, from differences in design to superstimuli alternatives like Tik Tok. But there’s an important element that has been missed: the fun of video games is in some sense *charged* from the boredom of everyday life. The more boredom you have habituated to in daily life, the more fun video games will be.

When childhood life around the 00’s and before consisted of boring schoolwork and activities, and you did not have the ability to find anything on YouTube and message your friends 24/7, the fun factor of video games stands out. This fun factor is relative to your default living condition. When you’re at school, simply getting free time to eat lunch and stand outside for recess is fun, or watching a boring documentary on a crappy TV. But over summer vacation this fun factor no longer stands out. Fun is relative to what we are accustomed to. And so back when life was more boring, the fun of a Halo or other game is stronger and more memorable. 

You might remember seeing your first “modern” television, and how captivating the image was. Maybe you remember when YouTube switched from 720p to 1080p. Maybe you remember recording a show on TiVo and being able to skip through commercials (!). The pleasantness and novelty of this is also relative. 

The importance of understanding this dynamic is that it proves to us a certain vanity of pleasure. A fun video game is fun, but it makes real life less intrinsically fun. A colorful dramatic television drama is engaging, but it makes our real life relationships less engaging. “Fun” is our mind being lit up by easy pleasure. Going from boring middle school life to GTA San Andreas is overwhelmingly fun. Going from modern GTA to San Andreas is no fun at all. Waking up on Christmas and playing Oblivion is fun; going from modded Skyrim to Oblivion is less fun. And don’t get me started on Chess. 

This fun differential is most evident in open world games, because the fun of the open world game is charged from real life participation; but open world games sap our pleasure from real life participation, to some degree.

This explanation is the least fun answer to the question of why video games are no longer fun. Because like a Renaissance vanitas painting it shows us clearly the vanity of games. Sum total fun was not increased in your life from your game playing, it was just transferred from real life to an artificial consumer product.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9dgwd/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9bzx0/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] What are your favorite examples of famous quotes whose meaning changes a lot in </title><updated>2022-07-15T13:02:47Z</updated><author><name>NondualGenie</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">What are your favorite examples of famous quotes whose meaning changes a lot in context? Two I learned this week (coincidentally both about religion) are:

Marx’s “religion is the opium of the masses” is actually  &#34;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.&#34; Also opium was much more widely accepted in Europe at the time.

John Adam’s quote about how “the US is in no way a Christian nation” was from a treaty signed with Muslim Tripoli and guaranteed by the Ottomans. The full quote is: “the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion,—as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen [Muslims],—and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan [Mohammedan] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.” Adams himself was a deeply religious, church-going Unitarian.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9bzx0/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9bwz9/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Polo shirts: tucked or untucked?</title><updated>2022-07-15T13:02:08Z</updated><author><name>orthoxerox</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">Polo shirts: tucked or untucked?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9bwz9/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig956er/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Been spending a bunch of time working on a homebrew D&amp;amp;D campaign.
