- Distinguish between *sex* and *gender*. 
  - Sex is a biological fact. Gender is primarily a feeling and is more malleable. 
  - A &#34;transwoman&#34; can thus be referred to as a male (who identifies as woman) without any controversy.
     - It is no longer &#34;women&#39;s sports&#34;, but &#34;female sports&#34;. Or not even that, but &#34;feminine hormonal profile sports&#34;.
  - Conservatives tend to defend &#34;women&#34; as a biological reality, but this is of course incorrect. Sex is the only biological reality. Their &#34;tradwives&#34; are merely females who have taken on a particular identity.
- Eliminate gender from language as much as possible
  - In English, stop using gender-specific pronouns. Replace them with gender-neutral pronouns. This means replacing &#34;he&#34; and &#34;she&#34; with either &#34;they&#34; (weird!) or &#34;he&#34; (as gender-neutral use).
  - The whole controversy around &#34;birthing people&#34; vs &#34;woman&#34; can be ended by referring to those people simply as &#34;females&#34;.
- Free speech segues into free thinking. 
  - Everyone is allowed to *think* that another person&#39;s identity (whether it is gender identity or not is irrelevant) is not a fact but only a feeling (and *their* feeling). This could be a &#34;transwoman&#34;&#39;s identity or a &#34;tradwife&#34;&#39;s identity. I&#39;m not required to accept it as reality. I respect their feelings, but it is not a fact.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igajyb8/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igafeex/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] **How does someone come to the conclusion that they are transgendered?**

I&#39;m fairly liberal in the freedom sense living in a very blue tribe area with very blue tribe loved ones. Most of these loved ones are very on board with the trans movements and I would desperately like to agree with them. I have read much and believe I understand where most of the big differences between conservatives, gender critical feminists, trans medicalists and gender affirming approaches to the broad subject. I do think each of these different contingents have their own kernel of truth but none of them really seems to by itself describe reality as I see it. 

This post is about self identification or how someone answers the self directed form of the infamous question &#34;what is a woman&#34;, that is &#34;Am I a woman?&#34; in their own head and my dissatisfaction with how all of the above factions approach it but mostly the gender affirming camp as they&#39;re the ones I&#39;m most consistently in disharmony with in my day to day life. 

When I truly try to put myself in the shoes of a young person attempting to tackle the question &#34;am I a woman&#34; I am presented with a couple interlocking challenges. 

1. The actual definition of what a woman is

For the conservatives and gender critical crowd this is fairly straightforward. It&#39;s a matter of what set of genitals you were born with and the rare exceptions where there are defects are to be handled on a case by case basis. 

Trans medicalists are defined pretty much exactly by their difference to the gender affirming camp by having a straight forward answer to this question but in doing so excluding some people. A Woman is either a female who does not experience some form of Body Integrity Dysphoria relating to sexual traits or a male who does. 

The gender affirming camp tends to approach this question in a lot of ways but they tend to boil down to a &#34;woman is someone who believes they&#39;re a woman&#34; and my problem with this definition and nearly all other formulations is what inspired this post and 

\2. How can I, with my single point of perspective determine whether I fit in this definition.

For conservatives and gender critical feminists this and the next part are quite easy. You appeal to your physical characteristics and in the very rare edge cases(intersex and similar situations) where this is not obvious you appeal to the community to find the most natural solution expecting grace from those around you on the subject.

For trans medicalists this is also fairly straightforward. If you experience strong dysphoria relating to your sexual characteristics then you are trans.

**Now the big one and the meat of this post.** How can someone armed only with the circular self identification definition actually evaluate if they are a woman? We&#39;re each only endowed with one first person experience and are unable to directly access the experience of a member of the opposite sex to compare and contrast our internal experience. There is no binary light in my head when I close my eyes that glows blue, no proof to myself that I am a man and no proof that I am not a woman. I can&#39;t possibly distinguish between the internal states &#34;I am a man(assigned male at birth) that incorrectly suspects I am actually a woman&#34; and &#34;I am a woman(assigned male at birth) who correctly suspects that I am a woman&#34;. With the total absence of proof, as this imagined child grappling with the question, I&#39;m terrified of the possibility of getting it wrong. 

\3. given that I am or am not a woman what do I do?

This is where the conservatives and gender critical feminists diverge radically. Conservatives expect women to lean into the traditional stereotypes while gender critical feminists consider those stereotypes harmful. And the trans medicalists and gender affirmation camps recombine to strangely enough agree widely with the conservatives on the stereotypes but just not the populations to apply them to. 

------------------------------------------------------

I&#39;d be grateful to anyone who can convince me that there isn&#39;t a huge problem here with the gender affirming approach because it would be far less stressful to be in dissonance with so many around me. I want to be convinced but not at the cost of not strongly believing the solution is correct. Feel free to also correct me if my modeling of how the other groups answer these questions seems wrong to you, in particular I think the conservative camp is probably very low resolution here.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igafeex/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/igac6mg/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] &#34;There are reports that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) at</title><updated>2022-07-15T17:11:47Z</updated><author><name>Atersed</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">&#34;There are reports that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) at one point banned the game from the ARPANET due to its popularity.&#34;

If you&#39;re in favor of legal abortion, you tend to be in favor of covid vaccines.  If you&#39;re against legal abortion, you tend to be against covid vaccines.  Why?  I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m asking you.

I will use &#34;pro-abortion&#34; to refer to the position that abortion should be legal and &#34;anti-abortion&#34; to refer to the position that abortion should not be legal.  I will use &#34;pro-vaccine&#34; and &#34;anti-vaccine&#34; a little more vaguely, but hopefully not too vaguely.  &#34;Pro-vaccine&#34; will refer to a spectrum of pro-vaccine attitudes, from &#34;it&#39;s really important that everyone get vaccinated and boosted&#34; up to and including legal mandates requiring vaccines to enter public businesses, the workplace, etc.  &#34;Anti-vaccine&#34; is the negation of this position.

If you tend to be pro- one of these things, you tend to be pro- the other.  Likewise if you are anti- one of these things, you tend to be anti- the other.  I find this to be curious, since it&#39;s hard to find a single unifying moral principle that entails both positions.

Frequently, debates over both abortions and vaccines are cast in terms of bodily autonomy.  &#34;You can&#39;t (force me to get a vaccine || force me to carry a fetus I don&#39;t want) because it violates my bodily autonomy&#34;.  If this was actually the key underlying principle at stake, then you would expect that people who are persuaded by the argument from autonomy in one case would be persuaded by it in the other, and we would see a significant contingent of people lining up in support of the pro-abortion-anti-vaccine position.  But this actually turns out to be a relatively rare combination of positions.

Full disclosure: I am both pro-abortion and anti-vaccine, because I take the argument from autonomy seriously in both cases.  However, I also feel that abortion is a more ethically complicated issue than vaccine mandates, which fits with the general observation that there is some underlying shared assumption or psychological trait that tends to pull anti-vaccine people towards being anti-abortion, and vice versa.

I don&#39;t feel like I need to provide much evidence in support of the thesis that there is a correlation between the pro-abortion and pro-vaccine positions.  It&#39;s pretty obvious to me.  Check any leftist discussion forum or news source and see what they have to say about both abortions and covid vaccines.

The correlation between the anti-abortion and anti-vaccine positions may not be quite as obvious, but I&#39;m still confident it exists.  Consider, for example, that of the [seven states which brought a lawsuit](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/courts/2021/11/05/ohio-ag-sues-again-try-stopping-bidens-vaccine-mandate-osha-coronavirus-covid-19-white-house-yost/6301706001/) against OSHA&#39;s covid vaccine mandate (Ohio, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia), six of them (all but Kansas) are planning to [introduce significant abortion restrictions or outright bans](https://reproductiverights.org/maps/abortion-laws-by-state/) in the wake of the Roe decision.  I take this fact to be reflective of the general anti-abortion, anti-vaccine attitudes of the people who live in those states.

So.  Why do we observe a correlation between these particular positions?  Like I said at the outset, I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m mainly just opening the floor for discussion.  I&#39;d like to get input from others here and hear what your ideas are.  However, I can briefly outline what *forms* a potential answer might take:

**Shared underlying moral principle** - perhaps I&#39;ve simply overlooked something, and there is in fact an underlying abstract principle that allows one to reason to both the anti-abortion and anti-vaccine position simultaneously, or vice versa.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be &#34;autonomy&#34;.  Even though everyone will acknowledge that autonomy is ultimately defeasible, and I acknowledge that someone could support a very strong principle of autonomy while also being anti-abortion and anti-vaccine (&#34;I support your right do you what you want, but the fetus is a person with moral worth, and you simply don&#39;t have the right to kill another person&#34;), I simply don&#39;t think that autonomy is actually what&#39;s at stake for most people, based on listening to public discourse.  This is particularly evident in the pro-abortion-pro-vaccine camp, where arguments from autonomy against covid vaccines are given essentially no weight at all.

One idea I&#39;ve been toying with is the idea of, not exactly an underlying formal principle, but the idea of an underlying &#34;aesthetic&#34; that could motivate the set of one&#39;s positions.  Perhaps rightists think that both abortions and covid vaccines represent the intrusion of the medical establishment into a natural, potentially even sacred domain that should instead be allowed to take its natural course, and it is opposition to this intrusion that motivates the anti-abortion-anti-vaccine position above all else.  Leftists could be motivated by an opposite impulse where they are fundamentally more sympathetic to humanity&#39;s attempts to control its own biology and environment through technological intervention.

**Shared underlying interest**: Of course, not all political beliefs are arrived at through abstract reasoning, or even adherence to deeper unconscious principles.  Sometimes they&#39;re simply opportunistic.  The type of person who supports abortion, for example, might see vaccine mandates as a convenient way to penalize the class of people who is unlikely to support their broader social agenda.  &#34;If you wouldn&#39;t get a vaccine then you&#39;re probably a shitty person anyway, and now your shittiness is recorded for all the world to see in your digital vaccine passport&#34;.

**Group psychology**: Maybe people on the right are anti-abortion-anti-vaccine because That&#39;s Just What People On The Right Do, and vice versa.  On this model of political psychology, people join a team, they see what their team believes, and then they go believe that.  I think there&#39;s *something* to this idea, but I certainly don&#39;t think it can tell the full story.  There are too many observable patterns in how people think and reason, and it&#39;s not plausible to think that all political reasoning is nothing more than a meaningless epiphenomenon of group identity.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig9f6v6/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9dgwd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Adding to the theme of FFT gaming posts.

There’s been talk online about [how video games aren’t as fun as they used to be](https://youtu.be/j4QKSCushmo). The ascribed reasons vary, from differences in design to superstimuli alternatives like Tik Tok. But there’s an important element that has been missed: the fun of video games is in some sense *charged* from the boredom of everyday life. The more boredom you have habituated to in daily life, the more fun video games will be.

When childhood life around the 00’s and before consisted of boring schoolwork and activities, and you did not have the ability to find anything on YouTube and message your friends 24/7, the fun factor of video games stands out. This fun factor is relative to your default living condition. When you’re at school, simply getting free time to eat lunch and stand outside for recess is fun, or watching a boring documentary on a crappy TV. But over summer vacation this fun factor no longer stands out. Fun is relative to what we are accustomed to. And so back when life was more boring, the fun of a Halo or other game is stronger and more memorable. 

You might remember seeing your first “modern” television, and how captivating the image was. Maybe you remember when YouTube switched from 720p to 1080p. Maybe you remember recording a show on TiVo and being able to skip through commercials (!). The pleasantness and novelty of this is also relative. 

The importance of understanding this dynamic is that it proves to us a certain vanity of pleasure. A fun video game is fun, but it makes real life less intrinsically fun. A colorful dramatic television drama is engaging, but it makes our real life relationships less engaging. “Fun” is our mind being lit up by easy pleasure. Going from boring middle school life to GTA San Andreas is overwhelmingly fun. Going from modern GTA to San Andreas is no fun at all. Waking up on Christmas and playing Oblivion is fun; going from modded Skyrim to Oblivion is less fun. And don’t get me started on Chess. 

This fun differential is most evident in open world games, because the fun of the open world game is charged from real life participation; but open world games sap our pleasure from real life participation, to some degree.

This explanation is the least fun answer to the question of why video games are no longer fun. Because like a Renaissance vanitas painting it shows us clearly the vanity of games. Sum total fun was not increased in your life from your game playing, it was just transferred from real life to an artificial consumer product.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9dgwd/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9bzx0/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] What are your favorite examples of famous quotes whose meaning changes a lot in </title><updated>2022-07-15T13:02:47Z</updated><author><name>NondualGenie</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">What are your favorite examples of famous quotes whose meaning changes a lot in context?

Marx’s “religion is the opium of the masses” is actually  &#34;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.&#34; Also opium was much more widely accepted in Europe at the time.

John Adam’s quote about how “the US is in no way a Christian nation” was from a treaty signed with Muslim Tripoli and guaranteed by the Ottomans. The full quote is: “the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion,—as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen [Muslims],—and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan [Mohammedan] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.” Adams himself was a deeply religious, church-going Unitarian.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9bzx0/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9bwz9/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Polo shirts: tucked or untucked?</title><updated>2022-07-15T13:02:08Z</updated><author><name>orthoxerox</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">Polo shirts: tucked or untucked?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9bwz9/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig956er/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Been spending a bunch of time working on a homebrew D&amp;amp;D campaign.

&amp;gt;Are you arguing that the extent a living organism is a human to the extent to which they are cared about?

I&#39;m not interested in how &#39;human&#39; someone is, but it seems sane to me that the value of someone&#39;s life (or rather, the harm incurred by taking it) is related to the extent to which others care about that person. The death of someone surrounded by friends, family, parents, children and so on, all of whom will be deeply sad at their passing clearly causes more harm, more pain and so on to others (namely those people) than the death of a friendless, childless, single orphan. 

The moral harm of someone&#39;s death to their loved ones is central to our conception of the value of life. When a young parent dies, we mourn for their children who will grow up without them. Other than young children we feel sorriest, at funerals, for widows and widowers, not for the deceased who is either gone or (hopefully) in a happier place. In any cliche scene in which someone in a film is begging for their life, what do they say? &#34;I have a family&#34;, &#34;think of my children&#34;, &#34;my daughter needs me&#34;, &#34;I have to look after my sick father&#34; blah blah blah. It&#39;s not &#34;I&#39;d really want to live so I can spend another thirty years enjoying chicken parmigiana and watching the baseball on the weekend&#34;, even if that actually sounds pretty good and even if our reasons to want to live *personally* are typically largely selfish. Our empathy is with those left behind, and the more of them (or perhaps rather the more sympathetic their circumstances), the more harm incurred. 

There are exceptional circumstances (half the country may love a political leader, the other half may hate them, some people have weird parasocial relationships with influencers or TV characters and so on and these are indeed all boring utilitarian questions), but by and large it *is*, in my opinion the case that, religious command aside, human value varies and is largely contingent on our utility to and relationship with others.

TLDR: Weinstein had weird deformed genitals, possibly as a result of gangrene[!] which may have lead to amputation of both testicles[!!!]. He also may have been severely impotent, requiring pre-coital injections to maintain an erection. Reportedly the jury saw photos of his genital region during the trial [to confirm testimony], and were visibly disgusted.

I&#39;m torn on the reporting of this and the framing of it as an explanatory factor in his actions. It&#39;s tempting to frame him as a sad man. &#34;Hurt people hurt people.&#34; People reach for these explanations to offer themselves a measure of control. It&#39;s not that rape is a fairly expected outcome of giving men that kind of power and failing to restrain it through social or legal means, or alternatively that we have to cope with the presence of certain evil men in our society, instead it shuffles blame into a nebulous idea that by a series of accidents sometimes there&#39;s a fat guy with a mean mom who loses his genitals in a freak and happens to have a lot of power over a lot of beautiful women. But that series of accidents isn&#39;t really preventable, it&#39;s just the universe, man.

And it has little explanatory power. Ok Weinstein had weird junk, did Lauer, did Epstein, did Prince Andrew, did Deshaun Watson? Or do they all get their own little just-so story that explains their behavior? When do we come around to actually confronting human nature as it exists rather than blaming the dark sides of it on aberrant chances?

I almost find myself wishing this information hadn&#39;t been published, because it retards progress on understanding rape in our society. It is clearly not the action of a psychotic minority of men, but a predilection that lurks within a significant minority of men and must be managed and prevented by policy and personal choices. Our society has this annoying tendency to say that we understand that anyone might be tempted to steal or kill, but only a sick man would think of rape. Then be shocked when so many men engage in pushing the boundaries of consent. 

The piece tries to take that stance, talking about how it is important to see rapists as people not as monsters. I&#39;d say talking about how his balls rotted off renders him more rather than less monstrous and inhuman and unusual. Less relatable, less normal. We need to confront the fact that there is no just-so story and no magic trick to preventing rape, that it is no different than preventing most crimes which people want to commit.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig7g4dp/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig7axly/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] [I wade into](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/what-boston-can-teach-us-about-wh</title><updated>2022-07-15T00:39:30Z</updated><author><name>ymeskhout</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">[I wade into](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/what-boston-can-teach-us-about-what) the &#34;what is a woman?&#34; debate and write a long post about the topic. My main point is that I think the argument over definitions is a distraction from more productive discussions.

Excerpt: 

Debates over definition boundaries can be a fun conversational frivolity (Are Pop-Tarts a [sandwich](https://twitter.com/matttomic/status/859117370455060481)? Are Algerians [Latino](https://www.reddit.com/r/LatinoPeopleTwitter/comments/nxhiet/latino_alignment_chart/)? Is *Old Town Road* country music? Etc.) but they’re most often deployed with other goals in mind. Arguments over definitions are often disguised queries for something else entirely. In [Yudkowsky’s example](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4FcxgdvdQP45D6Skg/disguised-queries), a factory worker is tasked with sorting blue furry egg-shaped objects (called “bleggs”) from smooth red cubic objects (“rubes”) on an assembly line. This job goes fine until the worker encounters a purple egg and has no idea how to sort it. The worker and his supervisor get distracted by the debate over definitions (Can bleggs be purple? Can rubes be furry?) until the *true* purpose of the sorting job gets revealed: bleggs contain vanadium ore, and rubes contain palladium ore, both of which need to be industrially processed differently. The ore processing plants do not give a fuck what color or shape their supply chain materials are so long as they accomplish the purpose they were built for. The question “Is this a rube or a blegg?” therefore is used as a good enough (and presumably cheaper) way of solving the ultimate (and presumably more complicated) logistical question of “Does this need to be processed by the palladium or the vanadium plant?”. But without a shared understanding from both parties for *why* the distinction matters, no answer will communicate any useful information to whoever is asking. It’ll remain a useless question.

Similarly, [if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7X2j8HAkWdmMoS8PE/disputing-definitions), does it make a *sound*? Another useless question. Both yes and no can be correct answers, depending entirely on whether your definition of sound is “acoustic vibrations” or “perceived auditory sensation”. Without first establishing *why* the distinction between the two definitions matters, no useful response is possible. Here too it’s possible to get infinitely distracted over which definition is the “correct” one, but the purpose of language ultimately is communication, and the more productive avenue would be to acknowledge that it’s helpful for distinct concepts to have distinct words. You can even make up new words (alberzle and bargulum for example) to avoid future confusion.

Sometimes ambiguity is intentional. Was [January 6th](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/the-january-6th-circus) an insurrection? Again, that depends entirely on *why* the distinction matters. The reason this might matter to a federal prosecutor would be maybe to determine whether they should file criminal charges under [18 U.S.C. §2383](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2383). But outside of that niche analysis, it’s reasonable to be suspicious of questions like this because of the serious negative connotations that *insurrection* inevitably conjures up. The question is very likely intended as a cover to ask “Was January 6th a Very Bad Thing™?”. Whoever asking the question then would have an interest *against* establishing a shared understanding for *why* the distinction matters. Because the goal with dishonest questions like is to score points, not gain information.

I am not the first to notice this deceptive practice. Parrhesia wrote about [the word games used](https://parrhesia.substack.com/p/playing-word-games-with-the-woke) in these types of discussions, most blatantly with the word *racism*. In terms of heavyweight champions in the semantic space, *racism* is a sought-after bruiser. It’s a strong word with serious negative connotations, and everyone is eager to use it to bludgeon their opponents. Asking whether something is or isn’t racist is the mother of all disguised queries. The goal here isn’t to gain information, it’s to find out who to bludgeon.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig7axly/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig5l4s9/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] It&#39;s on now: [Twitter sues Elon Musk to enforce original merger agreement](https</title><updated>2022-07-14T17:41:36Z</updated><author><name>greyenlightenment</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">It&#39;s on now: [Twitter sues Elon Musk to enforce original merger agreement](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/twitter-sues-elon-musk-to-enforce-original-merger-agreement.html)

&amp;gt;The outcome of the dispute could be unpredictable, legal experts say, and could involve a judge forcing Musk to complete the deal or forcing him to pay a $1 billion breakup fee, or other scenarios including a settlement, renegotiation of the purchase price, or even Musk walking away without paying anything.

&amp;gt;Twitter is seeking a four-day trial in September, according to a court filing.

&amp;gt;In the suit filed Tuesday, Twitter argued that Musk’s conduct during his pursuit of the social network was in “bad faith” and accused the Tesla CEO of acting against the deal since “the market started turning.”

Elon seems completely unfazed by the whole thing. His followers do not seem to care either and agree with Elon on the bot excuse/problem.

I have observed that many of the people who opposed the deal 2 month ago at $44 billion on the grounds of Elon being bad for Twitter, now want Elon to be forced to buy Twitter, which strikes me as odd.

As mentioned last week, I think it&#39;s unlikely he will be forced to pay the $44 billion. Either a large fine or buying twitter a discount. If Elon is fined, twitter is goin to have a hell of  a time collecting on it, and likely it will be stalled out.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig5l4s9/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig5etui/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] I want to understand people who honestly believe that a human fetus is not a hum</title><updated>2022-07-14T17:01:34Z</updated><author><name>OracleOutlook</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">I want to understand people who honestly believe that a human fetus is not a human person of moral weight.  From previous discussions I take that this is most of the people on this forum, and in fact most people on this forum have a hard time understanding someone like me, who believes that all living human organisms have 100% equal moral weight.  

I don&#39;t want to talk about abortion per se, because that gets into bodily autonomy and other moral considerations that muddy the water.  I want to investigate what gives humans moral weight, in the minds of Mottizens.  I devised the following thought experiment and questions to really get into the fine details:

Imagine a mad scientist who created a memory wiping chamber.  An orphaned, friendless adolescent wanders into the chamber and has their mind wiped.  As part of this process, they will be in a helpless coma for a few weeks, followed by a long period of relearning how to eat, walk, and talk.  As I mentioned, no one has a sentimental attachment to the person they were and they will have 0 memories of their previous life.  

1. While they are in the coma, is it morally acceptable to stab them?  Poison them?  Otherwise seek their death?
- If not, would it be ok for the mad scientist to starve them or otherwise not seek to provide medical treatment to keep them alive through their coma?  
- Does this answer change if the coma period extends from a few weeks to a few years?  When is the cutoff period at which it is acceptable to actively kill them or passively refuse aid?  

2. If you say that it&#39;s not ok to kill them and/or it is necessary to render aid given their helpless state, what is it that makes them a human person to you? 
- Is it that they resemble you physically in some respect?
- Is it that they will soon regain the abilities that you think define personhood?
- Is it that they once experienced the abilities that you think define personhood even if there&#39;s no conscious continuity?  
- Something else?

Edit:

A recurring question is what the coma process is like, so to clarify:

The brain is reformatting itself, this is a process that is uninterruptible and will take a long period of time. During this time the brain is not having what we would consider thoughts or experiences, though there is some sort of electrical activity. Electrical activity closer to 8 weeks of gestation than 40 weeks of gestation.  The subject is not light sensitive and not forming memories, for instance.  This process is happening on its own and is certain to complete itself in two weeks as long as the body is kept hydrated.

I also really don&#39;t want to talk about abortion.  Even talking about zygotes/embryos has been getting off topic.  I want to identify what a human person is and how that is different from a living human organism for most Motte people.

So far, the answer I&#39;m getting is a certain amount of gray matter, though it doesn&#39;t depend on if it&#39;s forming a thought.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig5etui/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig4rlyd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Yglesias: [How Hillary Clinton unleashed the Great Awokening](https://www.slowbo</title><updated>2022-07-14T14:33:32Z</updated><author><name>Stefferi</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Yglesias: [How Hillary Clinton unleashed the Great Awokening](https://www.slowboring.com/p/how-hillary-clinton-unleashed-the)

&amp;gt;Part of the issue here is that Democrats have consistently chosen to interpret the fact that Trump is a scumbag as indicating that Trump is an ideological extremist, when these are just different questions. But I think in some ways the bigger and more unconsidered issues have to do with how the 2016 primaries played out. In particular, Clinton got spooked by Bernie Sanders’ stronger-than-expected early showing and decided to respond by outflanking him to the left on social issues. I believe that this backfired and caused Sanders to do better with moderate Democrats than he otherwise would have done and also bolstered his popularity with the general electorate.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;But both Clinton and Sanders seemingly believed that her efforts in this regard were highly effective.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;After the primaries, the Sanders team decided they needed to outflank the establishment by moving even further left on identity issues, and the establishment decided that front-loading identity issues was their ticket to holding an incipient socialist takeover at bay. So while the question in the 2016 primary was something like, “should we move left on identity or on economics?” the answer ended up being, “let’s do both.”

I think this comports with what I observed following, for instance, various Sanders groups in 2016. Sanders started by having, genuinely a bunch of fans who can be described as &#34;Bernie bros&#34; and didn&#39;t have particularly woke views on social issues, even if they probably could be described as generic liberals. Polls showed that Bernie had fans among \*both\* left-wing and moderate Democrats, and served, to some degree at least, as a general stop-Hillary, throw-the-bums-out candidate in the primary; Yglesias fingers Iraq War as the big issue which lessened Hillary&#39;s popularity. Pretty soon Hillary team responded by highlighting social issues (the &#34;Would that end racism?&#34;) speech and, upon losing, Sanders team decided that they must outflank this outflanking in 2020, contributing to a purity spiral.

The title might be wrong, some have stated that the beginning of the &#34;awokening&#34; is in 2012-2013 with Trayvon Martin case and so on, but this doesn&#39;t necessarily conflict with the idea that the 2016 Democratic primary is also a pivotal movement - the 2012-2013 period might have well created the necessary preconditions for the dynamic where the most natural reaction to a challenge is generally trying to outflank the challenger from the left on social issues.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig4rlyd/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ig2zc7f/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Forgive me if this is too low-effort and unsourced- but does anyone else think t</title><updated>2022-07-14T03:25:07Z</updated><author><name>buttfaceszn</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Forgive me if this is too low-effort and unsourced- but does anyone else think that CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy) is fake? Or at the very least unconfirmed and asserted as fact?  

I say this after a post in the NFL subreddit about a quote from Hall of Fame linebacker Brian Urlacher, where he says that retired players are falsely claiming CTE to get money from a lawsuit. Now Urlacher is wrong on a key point, in that the NFL’s settlement was paid out to all retired players and there is no pending lawsuit against the NFL. But many if not most of the comments on the post took issue with the fact that Urlacher says there are players falsely proclaiming they have CTE. The most discussed study about CTE, at least among low-information sources like Reddit, was an examination of the brains of 113 former NFL players, of which 112 apparently had CTE. Some people point out that the methodology was flawed, as the sample was sourced from families who suspected their deceased relative had CTE. But even with the sampling bias, it still seems wildly implausible to me.  

I did a very low effort examination of the research, as in I read the abstracts of a few papers about CTE on pubmed, and it does seem as if there is some skepticism among researchers about it. The reported symptoms are all over the place: brain fog, memory loss, depression, anxiety, su*cidal thoughts, erratic behavior, mood swings, difficulty thinking, etc. Now all of these symptoms sound unverifiable and difficult to link to CTE, they also seem like things that are particularly suggestible and prone to confirmation bias, as in if you are told you likely have CTE, it’d be very easy to report having had some of these symptoms even if they were unrelated. The more serious, or at least more easily observable symptoms are early onset dementia/Alzheimer’s, or at least something that seems similar and is similarly linked to a degenerative brain disease. But if 99% of NFL players have CTE, or even 50%, wouldn’t it be very obvious if they were suffering from early degenerative brain diseases at a higher rate than the population? Is there any evidence of this?  


Some of my skepticism also relates to the diagnostic criteria. I am completely unqualified to comment on any of this- but my understanding is that CTE is reportedly caused by an accumulation of tau protein tangles or bundles, and that these are also linked with other degenerative brain diseases. But AIUI, these also naturally occur to some extent in everybody as we age. So is there some threshold of the amount of tau protein that qualifies as CTE, or is it something that you can always find if you look for it? Is there a study comparing the prevalence of this in former athletes against a representative sample of non-athletes?   


As far as I can tell, almost none of the questions I posed have been studied or have a clear answer. Yet for years people have been claiming that they will never let their children play football, that football should be illegal, that every time a former player commits a crime or does something weird that it’s because of their CTE. But to me it seems at least unproven, and very well may not be an issue at all. The long list of vague symptoms seems to sound a lot like some psychosomatic illnesses, or things that could be caused by a number of other issues. Note, the current hypothesis about CTE is that it is caused by repeated, low impact collisions to the head, like from soccer players heading the ball or routine blocks and tackles in football. This is separate from the brain damage caused by repeated concussions, which I am not at all skeptical about. Wondering if anyone else has thought about this?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ig2zc7f/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vxw6lz/wellness_wednesday_for_july_13_2022/ig22xn5/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Thanks everyone who replied to [my post last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheM</title><updated>2022-07-13T23:18:46Z</updated><author><name>LastNightLonely</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">Thanks everyone who replied to [my post last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if3qh70/?context=3). I did indeed start swiping on other guys on Tinder. I somehow got four matches in a couple days, and two of them didn&#39;t even ghost me immediately! We switched to Snapchat texts and everything.

...which was *absolutely exhausting*. I don&#39;t understand how people chat over text with near-strangers they&#39;re trying to possibly date. The notification sound now produces not so much butterflies as the panic response.

One guy gave me kind of pushy/weird vibes after a bit, so I blocked him, solving one problem. The other guy seems pretty cool so far. I followed TracingWoodgrains&#39; advice of suggesting an in-person meeting soon, which seemed to go over well, but he&#39;s not going to be free until the weekend, dooming me to several days of awkward texting. We might do a call soon at least.

On one hand, I hope it goes well, but on the other, I wouldn&#39;t be too upset if this connection disintegrated. Perhaps I should hold out for meeting people in-person or as friends of friends.

Judicial review, first implemented in Marbury v Madison, is the basis of the powers traditionally held by the Supreme Court. This article goes over the history of it, but I can&#39;t get over the slant. It reads like nothing more nor less than sour grapes. Judicial review is bad because it is leading to bad outcomes today, right now. Starting from the end of the article:

&amp;gt;Under any government, there is always a danger of its power being abused. Democratically elected legislatures are not immune from this problem. It must be admitted that, should Republicans take control of Congress and the White House without any constraint from the Court, there’s a strong chance they’d pass all manner of abusive stuff. The Florida legislature, for example, recently passed a bigoted “don’t say gay” bill that blatantly violates the civil rights of LGBT teachers.

&amp;gt;But the risk of theoretically unconstrained congressional majorities must be set against the current fact of the Court steadily stealing the powers of Congress, eroding the freedom of the people—and, of course, doing nothing to protect gay Florida teachers from a feral state legislature. It’s far from the first time American courts have ignored the Bill of Rights, and it won’t be the last.

Bad outcomes, therefore judicial review is bad now, and while it could be worse in the future, we have to do something now.

From earlier:

&amp;gt;A current or future president, in response to some particularly egregious Supreme Court diktat, would explain their problems with the ruling, and insist that they will not obey the decision. They would say that in their opinion, Marbury v. Madison was wrongly decided, that the Court does not get to claim sole power to interpret the Constitution, and that the Constitution has no stipulation about the U.S. being a judicial dictatorship. From now on, if Congress, for example, directs the president to regulate air pollution, then they will do as instructed, rather than obeying the Court’s wishes.

Of course, we have had prior Presidents who have done exactly this! And what does the article have to say about Old Hickory?

&amp;gt;While challenging the judiciary is commonly associated with Andrew Jackson, the two best presidents in history, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt, had no choice but to directly confront the Court in order to advance justice.

While commonly associated with (bad president) Jackson, it&#39;s also been used by (good presidents) Lincoln and Roosevelt!

Now, I&#39;m no fan of Marbury v Madison. I don&#39;t think judicial review should be as powerful as it is today. But this author barely grapples with the fact that it is a sword that cuts both ways. Without judicial review, you don&#39;t get Brown v Board, you don&#39;t get Roe v Wade, you don&#39;t get Chevron v NRDC, you don&#39;t get Wickard v Filburn. Without judicial review you certainly don&#39;t get the two biggest Left wins in the court in the last decade, Obergefell v Hodges and Bostock v Clayton County. The things being specifically being complained about, West Virginia v EPA and Dobbs v Jackson&#39;s WWH, are themselves reversals of previously enacted judicial review!

So I ask the motte, is judicial review good, or bad? Has it outlived its usefulness, or was it ever useful? And when and how should Marbury v Madison be contested, if at all? I had hoped for a more nuanced take on it, but the article I shared got me thinking.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1ycv6/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1j84r/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] A bit of news that should surprise no one paying attention to social media and i</title><updated>2022-07-13T21:01:48Z</updated><author><name>_Cullis</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">A bit of news that should surprise no one paying attention to social media and its role in modern society:

Initial reporting only came from an article [sourced to an Indiana doctor who&#39;d had a 10 year old child brought in for an abortion after one was not available in Ohio.](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/health/2022/07/01/indiana-abortion-law-roe-v-wade-overturned-travel/7779936001/)  The story naturally attracted a lot of attention from abortion-rights advocates up to and including [the President.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/08/biden-abortion-10-year-old-rape-victim/)  Given the story&#39;s visceral impact and the general inability of Republican politicians [to defend the policy,](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/03/kristi-noem-abortion-children-00043886) there was a lot of skepticism thrown at the initial reporting.

Most notably, the [attorney general of Ohio](https://www.fox19.com/2022/07/12/not-whisper-evidence-show-10-year-old-ohio-rape-victim-got-abortion-indiana-ag-yost-tells-fox-news/) went on Fox News and claimed the story had no evidence, and the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-abortion-story-too-good-to-confirm-joe-biden-ten-year-old-girl-indiana-ohio-caitlin-bernard-11657648618) called it a &#34;fanciful tale.&#34;

Today we have confirmation that [a man was arrested and charged with a crime fitting that description in Columbus, OH.](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2022/07/13/columbus-man-charged-rape-10-year-old-led-abortion-in-indiana/10046625002/)</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1aso9/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig0u4zm/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Fresh off [the lithium debacle](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7iAABhWpcGeP5e6S</title><updated>2022-07-13T18:19:26Z</updated><author><name>89237849237498237427</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Fresh off [the lithium debacle](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7iAABhWpcGeP5e6SB/it-s-probably-not-lithium), Slime Mold Time Mold (SMTM) has a new blogpost on *one weird trick* that causes weight loss: [eating potatoes, and only potatoes.](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/07/12/lose-10-6-pounds-in-four-weeks-with-this-one-weird-trick-discovered-by-local-slime-hive-mind-doctors-grudgingly-respect-them-hope-to-become-friends/). The idea is that eating a diet consistent solely of potatoes will lead to considerable weight loss, and the results are plain to see. [No one gained weight](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ahPd4EygAeEXd2we3MAb5EuX_Wm0sCGBPQ4qYjg6u8iIJF9ppFKh9rO9SQxEzAfTgn-Ts460M6jmjHvf4LOhUuOaEJFXZMD76TUswGpTU8E9K0XmaDEu3ev7O1xU8EX99KkosyQYy9RWuCNVRgU), [mean weight loss was pretty large](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SvOOLFA04BaBzC53ckpT2ZvNuAsnUpDzHltfEGBHUJK-LNvlNErRuTsWiTQS0mxhtHOFqmZHwg3QbOeMhlF6Fz1MXDavpQnlQ18k0iyUUUWGUu_dK7A9hlrNqJEsvSu9Nddehv8lr-Sd1hgk1fw), and [results were reasonably consistent by BMI before the experiment](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/owVbw0OZIQdIiRwq6lRoNtJ0ONOTdFQa5rqEBI41qw68BUqnSvNjKhDnGfe_YtZAaQbyoKDip9eCE_rT-Wm0-dlAkxLcs6BZDtPMXjL_u-ztB1jbubCOorXx-qmD2aOZtW_nq46sgGCEjt5xIKc). SMTM&#39;s post sounds deservedly ecstatic, but it also sounds undeservedly like they think they&#39;ve made a discovery.  
  
Throughout the article, they pepper in comments like &#34;If you predicted (or could have predicted) that the potato diet would cause this kind of weight loss, or if medical / nutritional science could have predicted that this diet was going to be so effective in the short term, and so easy for so many people — then why haven’t doctors and nutritionists been recommending the potato diet to people alongside diet and exercise?&#34; and &#34;We understand if you don’t really get this. We didn’t get it either, despite reading about all the previous success stories, until one of us tried the potato diet for ourselves. Hunger vanishes in a really weird way that is hard to describe to anyone who hasn’t felt it directly. So listen to all our participants who are like “no it’s not calories, it’s not willpower”. Or try it for yourself, you might be surprised!&#34; At a first glance, it&#39;s difficult to imagine someone wrote this with anything like serious intent, and these sorts of quotes are commonplace throughout the blogpost. They stand as solid evidence of virtually complete ignorance of this area of research. I&#39;ll explain by tackling these quotes.  
  
The first one should stand out to SlateStarCodex readers who remember [this review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/25/book-review-the-hungry-brain/) of Stephan Guyenet&#39;s *The Hungry Brain*. At the beginning of Section III, Scott described a very relevant study: &#34;In 1965, some scientists locked people in a room where they could only eat nutrient sludge dispensed from a machine. Even though the volunteers had no idea how many calories the nutrient sludge was, they ate exactly enough to maintain their normal weight, proving the existence of a “sixth sense” for food caloric content. Next, they locked morbidly obese people in the same room. They ended up eating only tiny amounts of the nutrient sludge, one or two hundred calories a day, without feeling any hunger. This proved that their bodies “wanted” to lose the excess weight and preferred to simply live off stored fat once removed from the overly-rewarding food environment. After six months on the sludge, a man who weighed 400 lbs at the start of the experiment was down to 200, without consciously trying to reduce his weight.&#34;   
  
The study in question is amply described in the book and can be read in full [here](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb34828.x) (or [via sci-hub](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb34828.x)). It&#39;s really something, but it&#39;s also not the only study of its type. There have been plenty of studies on single-food diets, both with animals and humans. The general tenor of their results is that restriction to a singular type of food leads to weight loss. People who read *The Hungry Brain* will be unsurprised that sort of work is cited. The authors over at SMTM evidently read Guyenet (he is cited twice in the linked post), but never read his book or they could not have written that first quote. But, we know from their series *A Chemical Hunger* (e.g., [here](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/07/a-chemical-hunger-part-i-mysteries/), [here](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/11/a-chemical-hunger-part-ii-current-theories-of-obesity-are-inadequate/)), that they at least cite *The Hungry Brain*, and even had [a blogpost on this exact study](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/23/a-chemical-hunger-interlude-b-the-nutrient-sludge-diet/). The blogpost is an unimpressive handwaving exercise by way of ignoring the post-1980 research on this topic and dismissing the pre-1980 research with the reason being that results from before the obesity epidemic really kicked off won&#39;t generalize. But this criticism is too broad. In their own potato diet post, they say that they expect their results will generalize, but for some reason, other monotonous diets will not? Perhaps their criticism only applies to this specific 1965 study, although I have doubts since they focus so heavily on potatoes, to the exclusion of general dietary monotony.  
  
Regardless, if you read just a few pages more in *The Hungry Brain*, you will discover (p. 65) where Guyenet predicts the result of a dietary content restriction: &#34;The fact that sensory-specific satiety drives us to overeat suggests a simple solution to the problem: Limit yourself to a few foods.&#34; What is the potato diet but limiting yourself to a few foods? The quantity of research supporting this point is enormous, so their arguing that it wasn&#39;t predicted - when they have evidently read and even written about material predicting it - should be galling for them. The snide remark they make asking why doctors haven&#39;t recommended eating potatoes only serves to obfuscate the reality that it is not potatoes that made the difference here, but induced dietary monotony. (Which is different from cross-sectional dietary monotony, both in terms of causes and effects.) To answer their subsequent quote
  
&amp;gt; If you knew the potato diet would work, why did you not run this study many years ago? Why are there no clinical trials? Did you think people would not be excited to see this result? 

It&#39;s clear that all that needs to be said is &#34;The studies were done, the trials were run, the results were in, you just ignored them.&#34;  
  
The &#34;We understand if you don&#39;t really get this&#34; quote refers to a reduction in hunger with the diet. My best guess about why they &#34;don&#39;t really get this&#34; is that they misunderstand hunger. Firstly, Guyenet explained their result very well, and his perspective is by no means unique. Secondly, hunger [follows a Circadian-like rhythm](https://eje.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eje/152/6/1520845.xml) and is reduced to a pittance when you completely restrict caloric intake. Consistent with this, [ghrelin levels fall when you fast](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/90/2/741/2836628). That is part of the standard explanation why, after a few days of fasting, you suddenly stop feeling any hunger. Even the subreddit /r/fasting [has a FAQ section mentioning this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/wiki/fasting_in_a_nutshell#wiki_5.2._tips_and_tricks). Hunger is similarly reduced by dietary austerity, and more austere diets yield bigger weight losses and less rebounding, but I don&#39;t wish to ramble.  
  
As with the rest of their posts on weight and weight loss, SMTM&#39;s latest comes up short. It ignores things they&#39;ve read, ignores obvious implications, mechanisms, and prior work that should be cited, whilst being replete with generalizability concerns despite failing to acknowledge predictions generalize to cover theories like their own.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig0u4zm/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig0g9km/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] A small update on the Ukraine war front - it appears that the sanctions Lithuani</title><updated>2022-07-13T16:50:11Z</updated><author><name>tricksandcandlewicks</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">A small update on the Ukraine war front - it appears that the sanctions Lithuania put on Kalingrad are [now facing pressure from an EU commission](https://statefirstnews.com/2022/07/13/update-today-breakingthe-european-commission-today-backed-down-to-russian-threats-and-issued-new-guidelines-saying-sanctions-dont-apply-to-rail-transit-via-lithuania-to-kaliningrad-th/). The EU wants Lithuania to back down. It would seem that predictions that Russia saw this move as a serious threat to its sovereignty over Kalingrad were correct. I was more surprised that the EU decided to fold that quickly. When they&#39;re already getting Russia to shut down Nord Stream 2 and other pipelines, it makes me wonder what cards are left to play.

While I do find the Ukranian case for war sympathetic, I really don&#39;t get the case for Lithuania poking the bear here. This isn&#39;t even a case of Lithuania building up a military capable of enforcing the regulations it was trying to pass, just taking an opportunity to swipe at the much bigger country next door for unclear reasons.

Pretty bummed out about not getting a specific job. I applied for a a job that was exactly what I was looking for. I had the exact tech stack they were looking for as well. Pay was good too (60k no tax, without bonus, not the US so this is a good pay). 

However, as a part of the interview process, I got handed an &#34;aptitude test&#34;, which was a blatant IQ test. I have never done a real IQ test, but my scores are mensa.no (130), mensa.dk (135). Now I don&#39;t put in too much weight into those numbers but I don&#39;t think I am stupid. My IQ is probably around 120 if we go by proxies of IQ. 

I failed their IQ test hard. They didn&#39;t give me a percentile, but I got 61/100. Mind you this test was a lot harder than standard IQ tests. All the questions were 3-d instead of the normal 2-d patterns. My score was below their minimal threshold. Now are they looking for the next Einstein for a junior role, idk. But I am still quite salty about it. I know IQ has real predictive power over interviews and other proxies, so I got told straight to my face that I am not smart enough, which isn&#39;t pleasant even if you know about it.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vxw6lz/wellness_wednesday_for_july_13_2022/ig03xrr/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig02yql/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Jordan Peterson - remember him? - has a [big talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch</title><updated>2022-07-13T15:24:36Z</updated><author><name>MelodicBerries</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Jordan Peterson - remember him? - has a [big talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxdHm2dmvKE) out on Russia/Ukraine war. 

It&#39;s over 50 mins long, so I will jump right into the most controversial CW part. Basically he raises the hypothetical question whether A) the West is degenerate and B) if it is, does that potentially justify or at least *explain* why Putin may have acted in Ukraine to forestall its assimiliation to [GAE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oVkne9WgpY)? 

An outraged left-wing activist has [cut out](https://mobile.twitter.com/thebadstats/status/1546327272780472321) the most relevant part. Peterson first answers the question regarding whether or not the West is degenerate. His answer is clearly yes. 

He then moves to the second part, and speculates that in his view, Putin could indeed have calculated that if did not invade then Ukraine would have become assimilated to GAE and thus lost forever.

Naturally, Peterson is being slammed online as a &#39;Putin shill&#39; and a Russian stooge etc, but the questions he raises are valid. Perhaps we are seeing an element of the culture war actually &#34;going hot&#34;. 

It&#39;s said that the 20th century was a fight between liberalism, fascism and communism. Perhaps wars in the 21st will be fought over transgenderism.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig02yql/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vxw6lz/wellness_wednesday_for_july_13_2022/ifzpff2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW]

Thanks to the wonders of the Poisson distribution I actually had 2 Bumble matches message me in the last week, despite typically getting less than one a month. I’ve been incelposting a bit more than usual lately, so maybe writing this up will provide some context for my point of view as well as allowing  others to offer perspective and point out errors in places where I may be blind.

Match number 1 was a thin blonde who opened with “How are you doing handsome?” Yellow flag. That is not something that women say to me, especially not as an opening. I’m not grotesque or repulsive(I don’t think), but I’m certainly not “handsome”, otherwise I wouldn’t be a mid 20s kv. As we continue chatting it immediately becomes clear that this person is both horny and forward with said horniness to an extent that I find very suspicious. This isn’t how I’ve known girls to act, but she doesn’t talk like a scammer or bot and her pictures seem real. It’s a work day so I try to stall until the weekend with some playful flirting. At some point she drops “I’m male but very feminine”. Mystery solved. I don’t see a “report as wrong sex” button on the app, so I just unmatch and move on. 

Match number 2 was more what I would consider “my type”. She’s a good bit overweight but has a cute face. She’s from the exurbs not the suburbs, has no visible tattoos or piercings, and overall seems to have a more conservative view of gender roles than the median woman on these apps. She sends me a “heyy” and I say hey back. No response. A few days later, after the debacle with match number 1 has played out, I admit I get desperate. I ask me friends if she’s out of my league, just to check if I’m being delusional. I get a “definitely not, go for it”. She has her Snapchat name on her Bumble profile, so I add her. We start texting on Snap. She replies very slowly, sometimes not at all, but there are a few moments where it feels like things are going well and there might be something there. 

I’ve had dating apps since my first year of college, but for most of that time I never really used them. This is the furthest I’ve ever gotten with a woman from these apps, and the furthest I’ve gotten with a woman since my not-really-a-gf gf in 8th grade that never got past holding hands. In the long breaks waiting for her replies, I notice my mental state deteriorating. It’s all I can really think about. I’ve never met her in person, but for the first time since early college I have a plausible path towards getting a girlfriend (or at least some kind of intimacy). I haven’t gotten the same butterflies when someone texts me since high school. I start checking my phone obsessively even though I have notifications on. When she leaves me on read I start to panic. I keep texting her. She never says stop, but I’m not a complete moron. I know what the most likely outcome is. At this point I almost want it just to have my sanity back. Finally she blocks me. I hate myself, but I’m free. No more obsession. It’s over. 

After writing this all out I am reminded of Scott Aaronson wanting to chemically castrate himself over fears he might harm a woman if he did not. I am not and have never considered going that far, but I do have to ask the question: Is it ethical for me to continue looking for a partner? Every woman who has ever swiped right on me either wishes she hadn’t or is indifferent. 

I’m 6’3 and make 70k a year if that’s relevant. Something is wrong with me.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vxw6lz/wellness_wednesday_for_july_13_2022/ifzpff2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vxw6lz/wellness_wednesday_for_july_13_2022/ifzla0z/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Anyone have advice on how to improve my text game?

A quick synopsis of the facts as we know them currently (subject to additional information and corrections, of course). 

1: Female subject with small daughter in tow attempts to purchase a number of items at a bodega, but her EBT card is declined. The clerk (M/61)runs the card a couple times, then declines the sale. When he gathers the items, the woman begins shouting that he assaulted her daughter, that he &#34;snatched&#34; a bag of chips from her etc. Unclear from video angle. 

2: Female subject threatens bodega clerk that she will go get her &#34;N\*\*ger&#34; and &#34;fuck you \[him\] up&#34;. 

3: Female subject retrieves her boyfriend, a 35-yo ex con with north of 25 arrests, including multiple arrests for assault and reportedly on parole from an assaulting-a-cop beef.

4: Female and male subjects return to the bodega and initiate first a verbal confrontation, followed by the boyfriend coming behind the counter and assaulting the clerk. The clerk stabs the boyfriend several times, and the girlfriend follows them behind the counter and stabs the clerk three times (exact timeline unclear). Boyfriend dies, clerk&#39;s wounds are superficial. 

5: NY prosecutors charge the clerk with second degree murder, do not charge the woman at all. They ask for $500,000 bond, the judge gives them a quarter mil bond. Later, under public pressure, the bond is reduced to $50k and enough money is raised to get the wounded clerk out of Rikers. 

6: Current status is the clerk has become a local [cause celebre](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/11/us/new-york-bodega-stabbing-murder-charges/index.html), but is still facing a second-degree murder rap. The woman who initiated every stage of the conflict and stabbed the clerk remains free of arrest and charges entirely. 

As I&#39;ve said many times before, I&#39;ve lived through this news cycle before. The swing in criminal justice public policy exemplified by BLM and the sort of reforms pushed by the rationalist community (among many others) very quickly started resulting in these sorts of issues. It&#39;s a sort of microcosm of systemic failure of the justice system. It combines outrageous social behavior, aggressive violence, the intentional policy of keeping violent criminals free, and swift punishment for the victims of violent crime who dare to defend themselves. 

This is, in my view, the inevitable result of the reheated 1970&#39;s policies we are currently implementing in many major cities. When criminals are considered the victims, it is citizens who are the &#34;perpetrators&#34;. Basic anarcho-tyranny. This is the criminal justice system currently being adopted, and if allowed to fully mature, we will probably see the same sort of crime wave we did in the &#39;70s and &#39;80s, complete with the economic hollowing-out of major cities, a civilian population that will get scared and start arming itself, and a criminal population that will explode when they fully realize that the only people doing time are the ones resisting them.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifzejpk/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vxw6lz/wellness_wednesday_for_july_13_2022/ifzau68/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Does anyone have any advice on making new and close friends as an adult with a b</title><updated>2022-07-13T11:52:31Z</updated><author><name>JosephinesOtherMan</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">Does anyone have any advice on making new and close friends as an adult with a baby?  Almost all of our friends moved away from our city during or after COVID.  

My wife and I traveled for a friend&#39;s engagement party (one of those friends who moved away)--it was fine.  The day after, we met up with an old friend of mine and an old college friend of hers who live there, and we had a much better time with them than we&#39;ve had with any of our friends at home in a really long time.  

... I&#39;m finding myself feeling a little sad after that for two reasons:

1. Most of our friends at home have moved away, and while it&#39;s not too hard to make little acquaintances or Jane Jacobs-esq &#34;public friendships&#34; around (especially with a baby), it seems very hard to find or develop close friendships at this point in our lives.
2. Meeting up with those old friends made me realize how distanced a lot of my friendships at home were--we were a large crew of folks who met up to have fun together, but ultimately we weren&#39;t very close (the contrast between the friends at the engagement party and the old friends the day after felt fairly extreme)

I have a handful of close friends who mean a lot to me, but almost all of them are distributed around, and we keep in touch when we can, though a lot of formerly close friendships have gotten a little less close over COVID for whatever reason too.  I vaguely worry that the only person who I can rely on is my wife (my family isn&#39;t reliable), and it scares me a little.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vxw6lz/wellness_wednesday_for_july_13_2022/ifzau68/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifz3f8z/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] I just have to return to a [two-weeks-old](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/com</title><updated>2022-07-13T10:32:20Z</updated><author><name>Stefferi</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">I just have to return to a [two-weeks-old](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vlopk0/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_june_27_2022/ie5imbr/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3) thread on vaccines and birth rates collapsing in many countries, since it just struck me (after reading some other discussions about it, admittedly) that it&#39;s quite odd neither me or the other posters considered one very obvious explanation: it&#39;s the vaccinations!

...and by that I mean not the vaccines themselves, but the vaccination process; at least in Finland, the local authorities [explicitly recommended](https://yle-fi.translate.goog/uutiset/3-11750453?_x_tr_sl=fi&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=fi&amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp) that women avoid pregnancy for two months (note: for some reason Google Translate translates it as a &#34;couple of months&#34;, but Finnish text talks about two months) after vaccination. I&#39;m not sure whether other countries had similar recommendations, but I&#39;d imagine at least some did.

Of course, the &#34;birth gaps&#34; noted are longer than two months, but similar recommendations might generally make people get antsy about the prospect of pregnancy, and so might the fact that even people who get vaccinated might well encounter a lot of antivaxx posts about the dangers of vaccination and pregnancy and thus be less willing to get pregnant. Who knows, something like that might ironically create a permanent effect \*even if\* it turns out the vaccine itself does not create major pregnancy risks.

Is there any info about various countries and their official vaccination/pregnancy recommendations, or any other way to test this?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifz3f8z/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vxw6lz/wellness_wednesday_for_july_13_2022/ifz2ezj/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Anything to watch out for besides oxybenzone (potential endocrine disruptor) in </title><updated>2022-07-13T10:19:49Z</updated><author><name>70rd</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">Anything to watch out for besides oxybenzone (potential endocrine disruptor) in  sunscreens?

Hence, polemics

I am always surprised by the rhetoric used in these cases, because the main defence from the progressives left is &#34;why we should care about this when we have the economy to care about?&#34;

Mind you, this tactic of &#34;but the economy?&#34; is probably the most used ever by every political side in history, but my point is another:
Is difficult to conserve your face if, suddenly, gender affirmation and the cultural war on it become a very trivial and stupid debate to do if the right do it, while at the same time is a topic that save literally lives if it is not done


How it is possible? The cultural war about gender is one of the main engines of the left today, but suddenly is trivial if the enemy does the same and debate on it? We are supposed to believe that, at the same time, is a stupid issue to die on but it literally save thousands of lives?

And I&#39;m not saying in this post that there are no good arguments about capitalism, I&#39;m only trying to understand the *modal* argument against capitalism.

I think people inherently don&#39;t like being told what to do. When someone compels you to do something, chances are it benefits them more than it benefits you, so we have an automatic reflex to assume that we&#39;re being shortchanged.

The weird thing is, when you look around at modern society, there&#39;s no one entity that really tells you what to do. If you don&#39;t like your job, you can quit at any time and no one will make you keep working. But then, if you don&#39;t have any job, you&#39;ll probably have to live on the street and that&#39;s not pleasant, so if you want to live a normal life you&#39;ll have to find *someone* who has money and convince them to give it to you.

The system that coordinates this is capitalism, so indirectly, the market forces of capitalism are telling everyone what to do. That inherently makes people dislike it, I think. You can ask yourself &#34;why am I doing something I hate every day?&#34; and trace the causal chain back and eventually you&#39;ll get to &#34;because capitalism&#34;. That&#39;s probably not going to endear someone to capitalism!

People won&#39;t say it explicitly, and it feels like of strawmannish to say out loud, but I genuinely think maybe 50% people who say things like &#34;fuck capitalism&#34; are imagining in their heads &#34;Capitalism makes everyone have to do stuff they hate all day and most people don&#39;t even get paid that much money for it. Wouldn&#39;t it be great if there were a system where nobody had to work and we still had our modern living standards?&#34;

Through this lens, a lot of arguments that seemed weird to me started to make sense.

1. The subreddit /r/antiwork. Enough said I think. Some people say that their real goal is just &#34;workplace reform&#34; or something like that, but I think that&#39;s just the motte. 
2. [Leftie youtube PhilTube made a video about &#34;bullshit jobs&#34;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_X-812q_Jc). If you&#39;re not familiar, [bullshit jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) says that half of all work people do in the developed world is pointless. If you look at his examples, like &#34;programmers repairing bloated code&#34;, I think you&#39;ll find this assertion a bit questionable. But you can understand why it&#39;s a very tempting idea: if half of jobs are completely pointless, that means everyone could work 20 hours a week instead of 40 with no loss in productivity! 
3. There&#39;s of course the preference for small businesses over megacorps. When a mom and pop shop hires you to work the register, that&#39;s not capitalism making you do it, that&#39;s just mom and pop asking you to do something for them and paying you for your time. They&#39;re probably giving you a good deal, right? But when Amazon hires you to work in the warehouse, even if they pay better than mom and pop and offer better benefits, suddenly is some weird foreign global system that&#39;s getting you to work for them. They&#39;re probably ripping you off!

Again, to be clear, I&#39;m not saying there are no good arguments against capitalism or anything like that. I think it&#39;s okay to look at bad arguments for position X, as long as you don&#39;t come away from that process thinking that those are representative of the best arguments for position X.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifvc3ol/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifu5vwr/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] In the UK the Tories are having a new leadership election.

For one reason or another a lot of minority candidates are in the race and people are talking about it. Much of it is presented as a reply to lawyer, full time virtue signalling tweeter, and [fox killer](https://barristerblogger.com/2019/12/26/should-jolyon-maugham-be-prosecuted-for-bludgeoning-a-fox-to-death/) Jolyon Maugham.

[This article](https://www.thenational.scot/news/20267870.jolyon-maugham-sparks-racism-debate-deleted-tweet-sunak/) covers the origin. 

[Of course the Conservative Party could choose an ethnic minority leader](https://capx.co/of-course-the-conservative-party-could-choose-an-ethnic-minority-leader/) says Sunder Katwala

&amp;gt; That ethnic minorities can reach the top of the political ladder matters – but it would certainly not make either Britain or the Conservative party a post-racial nirvana. While it will take more to shift the Conservatives’ share of the ethnic minority vote, the leadership contest sends a powerful symbolic message about the race to the top. The next challenge will be to develop the substantive agenda to deliver on that promise.

[In a more humourous article about poorly air conditioned leadership speeches](https://archive.ph/8pIpT#selection-1559.0-1559.144) Tim Stanley remarks 

&amp;gt; Actually, I think historians will write that the two notable things about this race were, one, it was incredibly diverse and, two, nobody cared.

Rakib Eshan says [The left’s problem with diversity](https://www.spiked-online.com/2022/07/11/the-lefts-problem-with-diversity/)

&amp;gt; The left’s unhealthy obsession with racial identity and ethnic heritage can only do more harm than good. Treating ethnic-minority people not as individuals but as representatives of ethnic groups will only undermine our multi-ethnic democracy.

&amp;gt; Beyond the identitarian game-playing, Britain is grappling with myriad social and economic problems. From the cost-of-living crisis to the endless backlogs in the NHS, the Tories have left numerous open goals for the opposition. The classic conservative message, that family stability and hard work can insulate people from harsh economic conditions, sounds tin-eared at best amid the current crises. These are the bread-and-butter domestic issues that Tory leadership candidates should be challenged on. But instead, the Conservatives’ opponents have been reduced to race-baiting playground behaviour.

Tomiwa Owolade writes for the New Statesman [It’s absurd to say the Conservative Party isn’t ready for a non-white leader](https://www.newstatesman.com/quickfire/2022/07/its-absurd-to-say-the-conservative-party-isnt-ready-for-a-non-white-leader)

&amp;gt; But the third and most pressing point is this: why shouldn’t an ethnic minority person be a Conservative? If we accept that not all ethnic minority people are the same – which should be the first plank of anti-racism – then we have to accept that they do not all share the same political perspective. And nor should they. Political pluralism should be staunchly defended: it is as important an element of diversity as any other.

--------------------

I&#39;d sum up the whole debate like this:

* The left know the Tories are doing better than Labour on diversity at the top so they&#39;re keeping quiet.
* The right don&#39;t care that much, and are mostly talking about taxes and cost of living. (Except Kemi Badenoch whose mostly talking about free speech and culture) But are willing to take a bit of a victory lap to indulge themselves. 
* While everyone writing about this topic is by definition engaging in culture wars. I think you can say that people who mention the fox are more tribal than people who don&#39;t.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifu5vwr/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/iftth4n/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] What does it mean for someone to &#34;find themselves&#34;?

I see this phrase used all the time in contexts that seem almost oppposite.

Joe is a 27 year old dentist, highly successful, but got into dentistry because his parents wanted him to. He decides to take a 6 month holiday in south america to &#34;find himself&#34;, hiking, partying and travelling, and comes back refreshed and ready to grind dentistry for another 5 years.

Sam is a 25 year old loser stereotype. Lives with his parents playing world of warcraft while working 30 hours a week as assistant manager at the local burger king. Started a degree in computer science but never finished it. Sam decides to &#34;find himself&#34;, a process which involves joining a gym, taking steroids, and getting into bodybuilder culture. He later competes as an amateur bodybuilder and starts an instagram, and appears to have higher self esteem, though the excessive focus on bodybuilding and steroids seems slightly unsavoury. His newfound lifestyle at least allows him to start dating, though he still lives with his mum and has racked up a problematic credit card debt.

Anne is a practicing surgeon and has a high pressure full time job. Anne decides to take on higher paying contract work for 12 months, which is similarly high pressured, which she describes as &#34;finding herself&#34;.

So finding yourself sort of seems like reevaluating your priorities in life, possibly changing them, possibly keeping them the same but with a firmer grasp on the underlying reasons, possibly changing your behaviours slightly but leaving your personality largely unchanged with slightly more money or sex partners, possibly focusing on short term financial goals to defer more profound goals until later.

I sort of see threads of commonality, but it also feels functionally like a just-so story for any set of behaviours whatsoever. Self improvement? Find yourself. 6 month holiday? Find yourself. Divorce and start dating fresh? Find yourself. Take on higher paying contract role? Find yourself.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/iftth4n/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/iftd8wr/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] [Noah Smith on how Shinzo Abe is not the man the West paints him to be.](https:/</title><updated>2022-07-12T03:56:00Z</updated><author><name>CD-ROM_INSTRUCTOR</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">[Noah Smith on how Shinzo Abe is not the man the West paints him to be.](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/abe-shinzo-a-retrospective) Some excerpts:

**Economic Policy**

&amp;gt;But most important of all was the shift in the economic role of women. Before Abe, Japan had persistently lagged in terms of women’s labor force participation, especially among mothers. The country’s sexism was legendary and entrenched. When Abe came to power at the end of 2012, I definitely did not expect him to change this — during his brief, abortive first tenure as PM, his health minister caused a national scandal by referring to women as “birth-giving machines”. Abe’s reputation as a staunch cultural conservative seemed to presage more business-as-usual.  
But it was not business-as-usual. As soon as he got into office for the second time, Abe began to talk up the importance of women in the workforce, and to implement some real policies toward this end as well. By 2014, it was clear to me that the national dialogue around the issue had shifted.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The key number we were all keeping an eye on here was women’s labor force participation, which surpassed the number for the United States for the first time in 2017.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;So on macroeconomic policy and structural reform, Abe really delivered in a way that I didn’t expect him to. And the results were clear — falling unemployment despite a flood of new workers into the labor force, record profits for small and medium sized businesses, and modestly rising incomes despite rapid aging and a growth in the old-age dependency ratio.

**Surprisingly Liberal**

&amp;gt;But by the second time Abe took power, his approach had changed. Abe visited Yasukuni Shrine — where the ashes of several Japanese war criminals are kept — once at the beginning of his term in office, but did not do so afterwards. This was in contrast to his mentor Koizumi Junichiro, who had made annual visits when he was Prime Minister in the 2000s. That was the first hint that Abe was behaving in a less overtly nationalist manner in his second term.  
In 2015, Abe reversed his previous denialist stance on the issue of Korean “comfort women” (WW2-era sex slaves), issuing a formal apology and explicitly laying the blame on the Japanese military for the first time.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;But Abe’s most liberal actions came in an area that’s not (yet) a hot-button issue in Japan — immigration. Under Abe, Japan opened itself up to immigration in a way that it never has before, with a “guest worker” program that offered a path to permanent residence, and a fast-track permanent residency program for skilled workers. The number of foreigners living and working and settling down in Japan soared.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The anti-racist wave that beat back the racists online was present in the real world too — anti-racist counter-protesters showed up to shout down the hateful Zaitokukai, usually outnumbering them by a huge margin. Of course, Abe doesn’t get credit for that activism, but unlike Donald Trump — who spent a lot of time attacking “antifa” and ran cover for racist demonstrators — Abe and his administration focused on cracking down on the racists. That kind of leadership makes a difference.  
On almost every issue of race and nationhood, therefore, Abe — in his second term — behaved as the polar opposite of Donald Trump. He opened up his country to immigration, tourism, and trade, apologized for past misdeeds, made overtures to old enemies, and cracked down on racism.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/iftd8wr/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifs4qa3/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] [deleted]</title><updated>2022-07-11T22:18:40Z</updated><author><name>[deleted]</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">[deleted]</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifs4qa3/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifrq463/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] In Poland, government decided to create a new school subject for high schools, &#34;</title><updated>2022-07-11T20:42:52Z</updated><author><name>Sinity</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">In Poland, government decided to create a new school subject for high schools, &#34;History and Present [time]&#34;.

===

(I&#39;ve translated it and dumped onto pastebin); some excerpts below:

Objectives

&amp;gt; 1. In the aspect of attitude to the truth: the acquisition of reliable knowledge of the most important cultural, political, social and economic changes in Poland and the world after 1945 up to the present - and in this context obtaining an understanding of the main issues of social life, politics and law, as well as knowledge of the immediate origins and nature of the great problems of the modern world.
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt; 2. in the aspect of attitude towards the good: to prepare the student for an independent and fair assessment of the said changes taking place in Poland and in the world since the end of World War II in terms of continuity and change (or rupture) in relation to the foundations from which our Homeland grows, understood as a community shaped according to specific cultural norms and visions of man, family and society dating back to the classical Greco-Roman civilization and Christianity.
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt; 3. in the aspect of attitude to life: acquiring an inquisitive interest in collective life, readiness to personally undertake social tasks and civic involvement in the spirit of patriotism as a wise love of the homeland formed in the tradition of the Republic, through the practice of individual and social virtues, as well as through the discovery of the harmony of rights and duties, freedom and responsibility, human happiness and the development of human communities, and the importance of just laws and prudent policies.

Some specific requirements

&amp;gt; I.	Knowledge of the fundamentals of social life. The student:
==
&amp;gt; 2) explains how the concept of &#34;social contract&#34; developed in modernity differs from the traditional understanding of the naturalness of social ties;
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 6) can explain the process of nation-building and the variety of contexts of meaning of this concept; explains what patriotism is and how it differs from chauvinism and cosmopolitanism;
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 10) can list and characterize the basic attributes of the state and explains what the raison d&#39;etre of the state is;
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 11) can explain the various models of the relationship of churches and religious associations with the state, especially those present in the tradition of the First and Second Commonwealths;
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 15) explains the basis and content of &#34;human rights&#34; and their relationship to the heritage of Western civilization (inspiration coming from Christianity and from the science of natural law dating back to Greco-Roman times);

(This last one is _interesting_ given beliefs of our current Minister of Education. See section &#34;Czarnek&#34; below.)

The left and the right have both recently used this slogan, and interestingly enough, have argued their points in almost exactly the same way down four levels of argument.

**Abortion**

- Left: When it comes to abortion, my body my choice. The government must respect my bodily autonomy and my right to make choices about my own body.
- Right: But it’s not just about your body. There is a child developing inside of you who also has rights, and the government must respect their bodily autonomy too.
- Left: It&#39;s not a real child, it doesn’t substantially have the ability to experience or think. Even ignoring my right to privacy, I have the right to avoid a life-changing nine month pregnancy which could see me dead or disabled because of it, and I would also be consenting to the onerous duty of having to raise and support the child for at least eighteen years, and in the case of an otherwise healthy child with Down Syndrome, in perpetuity.
- Right: Well, how about adoption instead?

**Vaccine**

- Right: When it comes to the vaccine, my body my choice. The government must respect my bodily autonomy and my right to make choices about my own body.
- Left: But it’s not just about your body. There is a community of people breathing around you who also have rights, and the government must respect their bodily autonomy too.
- Right: It&#39;s not a real vaccine, it doesn’t substantially prevent transmission. Even ignoring my right to privacy, I have the right to avoid a life-changing shot which could see me dead or disabled because of it, and I would be consenting to the onerous duty of having to show the government and private companies my vaccine cards with all required boosters in perpetuity.
- Left: Well, how about lockdowns instead?

EDIT: Well, it looks like I found a nigh-perfect [scissor statement](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/). Although I have opinions on both topics, I was inspired to post this simply by how closely the arguments are mirrored.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifqh42h/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifqfwcp/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] I would appreciate if someone could provide feedback on this line of thinking.

It&#39;s something that occurred to me during a long evening walk and I can&#39;t decide whether this is a somewhat accurate map of the territory or a complete fabrication of some baser part of my mind.

Collectivism as a different mode of being. I had always assumed that people who lean toward it do so through a conscious choice, that they think through some sort of mini social contract, judge the benefits, and accept/reject it on merit before joining a group. Also, they&#39;re conscious and watchful while part of some group so that if the group breaks the contract, they would leave it.

But what if it&#39;s not a conscious choice? What if, whoever dips their head under the collectivist waterline, surrenders their &#34;self&#34; and their brain becomes a substrate for running the collective&#39;s distributed OS?

Perhaps it will help if I describe what lead me to this train of thought. I imagined a person deeply enmeshed in some collective identity. If you&#39;re in the US, imagine a woman with short blue hair, her face full of piercings, a t-shirt that says &#34;long live Che&#34;, a pair of Doc Marten&#39;s, and NPR blaring on her headphones. Or, to balance things out, imagine an obese man driving a leased pickup truck with one American and one Gadsden flag, listening to a radio version of One America Network&#39;s report about election fraud.

What these two stereotype images have in common is that it seems both of these people have surrendered their minds to a collective. In other words, they outsource their opinion-formation and worldview out to a group of people. Do they still reason? Are they critical of new information? Do they introspect? Or do they merely think what their chosen collective tells them to think?

I&#39;ve met many people that fall somewhere farther or closer to these stereotypes. And one characteristic that always strikes me is that they communicate in the same way: repeating slogans or headlines from their preferred media source (or social media milieu), ie. they&#39;re outputting canned rhetoric someone cooked up for them. Because of that, they can&#39;t actually engage in a discussion because they can&#39;t respond to arguments. They can only shoot back these prepackaged messages.

Going down this slippery slope, talking with people like this doesn&#39;t mean engaging with a reasoning individual, but with a tentacle of a much larger organism. Basically, an alien.

Eh, I know that to some this must sound like an edgy 16 yo&#39;s, &#34;2deep4you&#34; line of thinking. I think I bring it up because it&#39;s dawning on me just how differently different people think and it&#39;s freaking me out. I think one of my core beliefs was that people reason more or less in the same way, but observing people is shaking things up in my mind.

So, is there any merit to this? Any threads in the form of reading I could pull to understand this side of humanity better? Any gross mistakes in this view?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifqfwcp/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifp0lwd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] According to [this graph ](https://nitter.net/QuarantinedCoof/status/15461851456</title><updated>2022-07-11T07:01:36Z</updated><author><name>RadicalizeMeCaptain</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">According to [this graph ](https://nitter.net/QuarantinedCoof/status/1546185145698353154#m), Biden&#39;s approval rating took a big dip after the Afghanistan pullout.

The (imo) stupid adage that science advances one funeral at a time is so old that I think it has finally [overstayed its welcome](https://rootsofprogress.org/how-curing-aging-could-help-progress) and, with any luck, we&#39;ll bid it final goodbyes soon enough. 

Yes sometimes, often even, it is right on the money. There are walking scholarly zombies all around: people who&#39;ve bet it all on a hypothesis, have been publicly and convincingly proven wrong (or had the ground move under them to the point their entire map became obsolete) and have not recanted. Indeed, some double down or just begin to ignore all criticism. 

What do we know about such cases and such people? Are they just cognitively rigid and emotionally invested? Bound like slaves to a cottage factory that has been built around their assumptions, perhaps? Does the stress of debunking alter their reasoning somehow, degrade it maybe? How does it feel from the inside? I&#39;ve seen some curious patterns, but don&#39;t want to bias you. 

The easy recent example: Hofstadter and GPT-3, see [Scott&#39;s 53rd point](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-june-1e7) and [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vp23id/quality_contributions_report_for_june_2022/iej8xel/).

I was reading about that [Russian fox experiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox). Domesticated traits started to occur only after the second generation. After six generations you had a few hyper-domesticated foxes and by the 20th generation 30% of foxes constituted this hyper-domesticated status. 

The Christian social system appears especially conducive to domestication.  Only those with especially prosocial tendencies will get the most out of services; those with especially “domesticated” qualities will be graded best by peers according to the Christian rubric of grading another’s behavior; greater voluntary activity within the church would draw in the especially prosocial, creating prosocial pairings similar to in the Fox experiment. Those who best internalized the behavioral proscriptions of the Church had the highest status, and this obedience is a kind of domestication. Traits like intelligence, humor, and athleticism have no real value in the historically Christian social system, although a minimum amount of intelligence was probably necessary to secure a mate.

Compare to what (little) we know about Paganism. Paganism had no such fixation on domesticated qualities.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/iflb2gs/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifkwy7m/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Are some smart people just naturally gullible?

My boyfriend is extremely gullible. Sometimes he&#39;ll send me instagram posts of literal fake news (not really partisan, more like tabloid-esque &#39;the Queen has cancer and 30 days to live&#39; headlines, or &#39;PROOF Rishi Sunak responsible for taking Partygate photos&#39;, ie., things that are plausible but also functionally made-up by the post); he sometimes struggles to tell whether some mockumentaries are fictional until 10-15 minutes in. Objectively he&#39;s very intelligent according to widely held IQ proxies, test scores, grades, his job and so on.
