I&#39;m picking up Vernor Vinge&#39;s *A Fire Upon the Deep*.

I&#39;ve considered this one of the nicer features of my home, particularly given how many cityscapes don&#39;t have all that nice of views. In the past couple months, a group of indigents have taken up residence in the park and seem to be escalating their degree of permanence; what started with someone sleeping with their head on their suitcase moved to having a couple mattresses, and today I see that a tent has been added. During the day, more of their friends show up and spread out more mattresses and blankets and drink all day. 

What&#39;s the appropriate reaction to this? How would you feel and react to it? I&#39;ve done nothing about it at present other than comment to my wife that I think it&#39;s going nowhere good, but I&#39;m trying to process whether I should be doing anything about it or just dealing with the fact that this is just how American cities are.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wnz8wv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_14_2022/ika0y4x/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wnz8wv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_14_2022/ik995xh/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Could anyone familiar with chemistry and neurobiology tell me how bad [S-Reticul</title><updated>2022-08-14T14:29:24Z</updated><author><name>Difficult_Ad_3879</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Could anyone familiar with chemistry and neurobiology tell me how bad [S-Reticuline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticuline) is for neurons?  I’m trying to figure out whether reticuline is neurotoxic like alcohol or something more serious. There’s some cool herbalism involving it but I don’t want to take chances.

I can only find its toxicity in relation to Annonacin where it’s written “annonacin is a thousand times (1000x) more toxic to cultured neuronal cells than reticuline”. Regarding annonacin, “Studies in rodents indicate that consumption of annonacin (3.8 and 7.6 mg per kg per day for 28 days) caused brain lesions consistent with Parkinson&#39;s disease. An adult who consumes a fruit or can of nectar daily over the course of a year is estimated to ingest the same amount of annonacin that induced brain lesions in the rodents receiving purified annonacin intravenously.”

One study has,

&amp;gt;we exposed mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in culture to the total extract (totum) of alkaloids from Annona muricata root bark and to two of the most abundant subfractions, corexi- mine and reticuline. After 24 hours, 50% of dopaminergic neu- rons degenerated with 18 􏰀g/ml totum, 4.3 􏰀g/ml (13 􏰀M) coreximine, or 100 􏰀g/ml (304 􏰀M) reticuline.

Now a lancet correspondence from 99 says,

&amp;gt; Although the two studies did conclude that simple 1-benzylated TIQs are “relatively weak neurotoxins” that can cause behavioural signs of parkinsonism in animal models, they did not examine the structurally more complex reticuline, a morphinan precursor (or any of its N-methylated alkaloidal derivatives or metabolites). As with many isoquinoline alkaloids, reticuline has pharmacological activity at diverse neurotransmitter synapses and uptake sites. However, a myriad of studies going back nearly 30 years have never revealed it to be neurotoxic. If anything, with its phenolic groups, reticuline is more likely to be a n t i o x i d a t i v e 4 , 5 a n d , t h u s, n e u r o - protective against the free radical- initiated toxicity that is commonly linked to neurodegenerative mechanisms.

The cell culture study looks pretty bad though.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wnz8wv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_14_2022/ik995xh/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wnz8wv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_14_2022/ik8mt3g/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Has the world gone fucking insane?

There are upsides and downsides for both employers and employees.  I have long lamented (pre Covid) in my own career that it&#39;s not more acceptable to take advantage of modern telecom and click the buttons at home instead of HQ.

I&#39;m thankful for Covid upsetting the old equilibrium.  As such, I&#39;ve come up with a new source of tax revenue, to of course be offset by a tax reduction somewhere else.

For every employee required to commute to work more than 3 days per week, the employer pays a *commute tax*, possibly scaling with commute distance, time, or congestion, in order to offset the economic and ecological harms of unnecessary commutes.  Harms include time away from family, stress, physical accidents, danger to self and others, air pollution, road wear, congestion impacts on others, etc.

I feel like there will be huge corporate pushback on such a policy.  What do employees think?

EDIT: multiple posters have pointed out a giant oversight -- much if not most work is necessarily on-premises.  e.g. a retail cashier.

I am super ok with wide exemptions here, but I haven&#39;t thought through exactly how to carve it out.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ik6xioi/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik6fadf/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] *Status: dreams and visions*

One of the applications of language models is [Question answering](https://paperswithcode.com/task/question-answering/latest) systems. They seem to fit nicely subscription-based business model. Here’s how it works: 

1. You specify the domain and scope of knowledge, that you want to encapsulate 
2. You hire a team of experts and extract knowledge from them (or from a suit of books). Since the model is pretrained for general reasoning, it only needs to fine-tune itself according to specifications from the previous step. The model queries people and processes their answers until ~~they confess~~ target quality is achieved 
3. Subscribers select domain, “number of queries per month” and a multitude of other parameters like “model capacity”, “answer granularity”, “knowledge provider”, “dialogue memory”, etc. 
4. Then you &#34;stream&#34; it, using web or app interface

Towards complete commodification of knowledge, capitalism has been dreaming of, with pipeline and valve. Few features:

1. Linear mode is still available – you can read long chunks w/t querying model piece by piece 
2. Everyone can pack their knowledge into a model and publish it online. What if someone publishes something bad? Right, that’s why each model gets checked and licensed by benevolent third party 
3. You can merge/import data from other models/books/humans; manually override it; you can grow model continuously  
4. Various kinds of knowledge might be embedded: factual, procedural, black-box &#34;tacit&#34; functions and arbitrary uncertainty distributions around them</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik6fadf/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ik5jzza/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Elon Musk is actually a Victorian-style reactionary who seems very jarring livin</title><updated>2022-08-13T17:50:41Z</updated><author><name>realIK17</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Elon Musk is actually a Victorian-style reactionary who seems very jarring living in the postmodern world.  I&#39;ve seen a video that makes fun of how outdated Afrikaans social morality is by having these two Afrikaans-speaking flight attendants innocently spit out racist and macho comments at passengers. 

So I think Elon Musk is also stuck as a Boer War era Afrikaan, which is like how the world isolated South Africa because it insisted on using the 19th century idea of apartheid in a 20th century postmodern world.  Elon Musk&#39;s idea of ​​heroic space exploration also reminds me of the doomed British Northeast Passage and Antarctic expeditions.

Of course, he&#39;s not 100% Victorian because although he has 10 children like a Victorian, he mates with multiple females like a modern celebrity.  So I think he has the core of Victorian social morality and worldview, which is expressed through the means of modern celebrity and mass media culture.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ik5jzza/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik3a798/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] On Wordle, I’ve decided to start playing “yesterday’s” word as my first guess th</title><updated>2022-08-13T04:31:23Z</updated><author><name>DuplexFields</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">On Wordle, I’ve decided to start playing “yesterday’s” word as my first guess the following day. It’s a suboptimal strategy when the previous solution has doubles of a given letter (or two), but it gives me a sense of continuity and challenge, and beats starting with “SLATE” or “ARIEL” every day.

What are your favorite Wordle tools?

My primary tool is Notepad, wherein I use the notation of capital letters for certainties, lowercase for possibilities and dashes for impossibilities. Let’s say the word is “&amp;gt;!NIGHT!&amp;lt;” and I’ve guessed “GRAIN”, “SPROG”, and “THERE”, getting no greens, some yellows, and all five letters by the third guess. If I didn’t immediately think of &#34;&amp;gt;!NIGHT!&amp;lt;&#34;, I’d type these in like so:

    G: -ggg-
    I: iii-i
    N: nnnn-
    T: -tttt
    H: h-hhh

I also have an Excel spreadsheet with every word in Wordle’s “guess” dictionary and none from the “solutions” dictionary, so I’ll never accidentally see the real answer. The five letters are each in their own columns, in a filterable List, so in the above example I can eliminate RASPO from all columns after the second guess and E after the third. If I’m still stumped, I can eliminate G from the first and last column, I from the fourth, and so on, and see what’s left to make another guess to eliminate up to five more letters. Of course, in this example I’ve got all five letters by my third guess, so I could just turn off all but those letters, and maybe turn some back on, to eliminate additional positions.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik3a798/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik2r0a7/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Spent my day install a cell booster on my house.

Ever since a big storm rolled through knocking everything over, and leading to some debate about whether we experienced a downburst or a tornado, my Verizon signal has been in the toilet.  So, $400 later, and some rather nervous work on a ladder, we now have a serviceable signal again.  It was a constant thorn in our side since moving out to the country, so hopefully that problem is fully well fixed now.

Been seriously binging Xenoblade Chronicles 3 more.  I got seriously side tracked by optional quests, and am now overleveled for the core story in front of me by about 10 levels.  The job system is **ok** so far.  I think what&#39;s hampering my enjoyment is the temporary cap of 10 levels per job I&#39;m currently laboring under.  So my characters max out their jobs rather quickly, and I find myself rotating them to new ones, not because I want to, but because I feel like I have to in order to min max.  And I&#39;m constantly running short of jobs I actually want to switch them into.  I&#39;m looking forward to the cap coming off.

Hit my first tantalizing and obvious reference to previous Xenoblade games, hinting at the world this is taking place in.  The trailer had hinted at things, and I&#39;m curious to see if the hints come to fruition.  But I think the Xenoblade &#34;timeline&#34; is a lot like the Zelda &#34;timeline&#34;.  Mostly bullshit theory crafting around thoughtlessly included references that give the games a unified feel, but aren&#39;t meant for serious theorizing.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik2r0a7/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik2c9wm/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] I think I have a leucistic duck on my pond.

The warrant authorizes a search of:

&amp;gt;The premises to be searched, 1100 S Ocean Blvd, Palm Beach, FL 33480, is further
described as a resort, club, and residence located near the intersection of Southern Blvd and S Ocean Blvd. It is described as a mansion with approximately 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, on a 17- acre estate. The locations to be searched include the &#34; 45 Office,&#34; all storage rooms, and all other rooms or areas within the premises used or available to be used by FPOTUS and his staff and in which boxes or documents could be stored, including all structures or buildings on the estate. It does not include areas currently (i.e. , at the time of the search) being occupied, rented, or used by third parties (such as Mar-a-Largo Members) and not otherwise used or available to be used by FPOTUS and his staff, such as private guest suites

The inventory is not terribly interesting itself. Mostly it classifies what documents they found by their classification level (Secret, Top Secret, etc) and characterizes them very generally.

There are three statutes listed as being the basis for the warrant. Those are [18 USC 793](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793), [18 USC 2071](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2071), and [18 USC 1519](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1519).

Taking these in reverse order. 1519 provides:

&amp;gt;Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

So the allegation is that Trump altered or destroyed some documents with the intent to impede some kind of investigation or administrative proceeding.

2071 provides:

&amp;gt;(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

&amp;gt;(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.

The warrant does not specify which section the allegation is for but I think (b) seems the most likely. (a) seems to apply specifically to judicial related documents and I don&#39;t think any of Trumps were of that kind. The inventory doesn&#39;t obviously indicate so to me. Looking *far* forward, will be interesting to see what kind of legal arguments might evolve around the prohibition of holding office in (b) if Trump were convicted and decided to run anyway. My understanding is current Court precedent prohibits Congress (or the States) adding additional qualifications beyond those in the constitution to offices that are mentioned in the constitution.

793 is probably the spiciest section. I&#39;m not gonna quote it in full here like the others because it&#39;s much longer. It basically lists out a bunch of subsections that have to deal with having access to information related to national defense and it being misused in various ways. If I had to pick a section I think (d) or (e) are the most likely. Those paragraphs cover anyone who has access to national defense information (lawfully or unlawfully) and refuses to turn over those documents to a United States officer entitled to receive it. From section (d):

&amp;gt;(d) Whoever, lawfully having possession of, access to, control over, or being entrusted with any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it; or

The way I read this section is that even if assuming Trump lawfully had possession of these documents (a dubious proposition itself, I think) he still violated this section by refusing to return the documents on demand of whatever government agency was entitled to receive them.

Section 1519 provides a punishment of up to 20 years imprisonment, 2071 provides a punishment of up to 3 years imprisonment, and 793 provides a punishment up to 10 years imprisonment. Note that these are maximums, not necessarily what someone convicted will get.

ETA:

One thing that jumps out to me is that none of these charges seem to depend on the classification status of the documents themselves. I&#39;ve seen some people float the idea that Trump could have declassified all these documents before leaving office but none of these charges read to me as requiring any particular classification level for the documents referenced therein. Maybe that&#39;s my lack of knowledge though.

ETA2:

For reference 18 USC 794(e) (the one I quoted but when you don&#39;t have lawful possession) is the one that landed [Reality Winner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Winner) five years in federal prison.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ik1ibdz/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ik0t07v/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Salman Rushdie has been stabbed during an NYC book event, condition unknown.

I have a separate thought about the series&#39; politics but I&#39;m posting that as a reply.

The prompt:

    despite the lackluster ending

Ughhh the ending annoyed me so much.

Pretty much from the beginning I had my nerd guess for what was gonna happen:

It turns out that using element zero (which causes the &#34;mass effect&#34;) increases entropy massively. After all, all that energy has to come from somewhere. Use it too much and the universe runs out or [insert doomsday scenario]. So the leviathans build the reapers to find a way to fix or contain it, then the reapers go a little overboard and murder everyone before &#34;seeding&#34; new civilizations to gather data on the mass effect. Things are going pretty well apart from the everyone getting murdered at the end of the experiment cycle part.

I like that I could see an indoctrination ending as the &#34;good&#34; ending here - if you have to choose between trillions dying and the universe ending, maybe the former is the better option? But of course, who knows if the reapers will even find a solution, if the other civs can&#39;t do it on their own w/o regular genocide, etc. There&#39;s room for disagreement, which I think is a necessary component of a good RPG ending. 

The actual ending feels dumb even by soft sci-fi standards. It&#39;s almost literally [they&#39;re made of meat](https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html). Apparently &#34;organics&#34; and &#34;synthetics&#34; just never get along. Never mind that synthetic is just a short-hand for semiconductor technology since that&#39;s the level where our civilization is at, and never mind that we&#39;d totally make self-repairing computers out of wet hydrocarbons if we could. Also disregard the fact that organic/synthetic just describes what is essentially a manufacturing process and should have little impact on ones feelings / value functions beyond naive looks-like-me ingroup bias (and why would you put that in synthetic life anyway?). The entire universal conflict is sibling rivalry with some AI risk thrown in.

I grant that this can be read as an AI risk device - the Leviathans, demi-gods from Ye Olden Times, notice that whenever their thralls build synthetic life, the latter rebels against the former. This tends to result in genocide. Replace &#34;life&#34; with &#34;generally intelligent agent&#34; and it&#39;s not a strange prediction. It would be kind of a stretch to have the leviathans a) be smart enough to meaningfully resist the AIs of their thralls and b) decide that building their own AI in the form of the reapers is a great idea, especially since that plan backfires as much as it possibly could. But who knows, maybe all the smart leviathans are working on thrall containment policy and reapers are a big political mess.

It still makes the ending fall kinda flat, imo. The choices of &#34;destroy, control, do nothing&#34; lack meaning if all you&#39;re deciding on is how to deal with a malaligned AI. 

IIRC some other game had the entropy plot as its big reveal, so maybe ME didn&#39;t want to seem too unoriginal, but I think it&#39;s still one of the better choices: It&#39;s narratively cheap since much of ME&#39;s plot still makes sense in retrospect. Geth calculate utility and conclude that the reapers are correct. Organic life doesn&#39;t and is also highly interested in staying alive, so the only way to align them is direct mind control. In the anti-Reaper ending you decide that humanity can fix the Mass Effect on your own (Renegade) or with the help of the rest of the universe (Paragon). In the pro-Reaper ending you either zip humanity into a new Reaper or die honorably and let them deal with the problem. I can totally see myself playing both and that rarely happens for me with &#34;good/evil&#34; playthroughs.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik0elg5/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ik05nvf/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] I found the Richard Hannania breakdown of his readers to be interesting.

Personally I thought he drew from more conservative readership.  But it’s actually fairly similar to motte users.  Instead top sources of his readers are Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander, Bryan Caplan.

https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/survey-results-i-basic-demographics

His likes and dislikes tables (mostly people) rankings is quite interesting.  You can find it under Hannania table PDF here.

https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/survey-results-ii-likes-and-dislikes

I agree with his questioning of sexual harassment and ideas around that where he cited free association as it should be allowed between adults.  If your a libertarian that should make sense to you.  Here’s a few I disagree with the general view on things (apparently from survey results of people like me).

1. Highest ranked big disagreement is Abraham Lincoln.  Comes in as 6th most favorable.  This gets complicated as I dislike slavery but longer term he ended the right of states to secede and with it a lot of the power of State’s Rights.  Personally in an alternative history I would think slavery dies in 30-40 years and a union is re-established while States Rights is watered down forever and eventually when that happened I assume a union was recreated.  Loss of States Rights makes me lower Abraham Lincoln significantly.  Tough call.

2.  Aella making the list is sort of funny.  Probably least known broadly but I guess most have heard of her in this specific community.

3.  Deng Xiaoping.  Way too low.  Probably because of the anti-Chinese bias today (partially earned).  But I would rank him top 10.  Hugely influential and in my opinion successful in eliminating more human misery than anyone else I can think of.

4.  There seems to be a correct interpretation to me that partisan low quality sources are rated lowly.  Looking at ADL/OANN with low rankings.

5.  Assad I rate a lot higher especially in the aftermath.  Simple utilistarianism when Assad dominated Syria was semi-livable.  Now rubble.  Somehow he kept everyone from killing each other.  Which counts for something in my book.

6.  AOC i rank higher.  She’s a meme politician like Gaetz.  Personally think she’s in a process of normalizing and will end up like Nancy Pelosi at 60.  Party leader in the machine.  I don’t have huge negative view of her.

7.  Xi i have a similar bad view of.  And it’s because I’m beginning to question his competency.  Mishandling of COVID and with an authoritarian bent.  I think low competency, bad values, and extreme power makes him a huge threat unlike Deng who had extreme competency.  I would rank him lower from his already low position.  Probably third from bottom.

8.  White Nationalism I rate higher.  Mostly because I don’t know what it means.  And I don’t think the bad version exists at any meaningful level which means it shouldn’t be below things like Xi that has real power.  Same view on Kamala.  Though unlike White Nationalism there’s no strong version that she’s a really bad person.  There’s nothing I dislike about her.  I think she got promoted to a position above her ability.  She shouldn’t be in the lowest tiers.

9.   The Taliban I rate significantly higher.  While they don’t vote on leaders in Afghanistan they seem to have the consent of the governed because no one cared enough to fight them even when they had leftover US guns to stop them.  I will respect a country choosing to be a theocracy provided their shit stays within their own borders.

10.  Weinstein I would also rate higher like Hannania.  On net he made good movies and from a utilitarian perspective he contribute more good than bad.  And I don’t view prostitution as close to as bad as the people he’s listed around him (trading sex for acting jobs).  Though he likely crossed into some non consensual stuff.  I just see a much bigger gap between what he did and Hitler/Stalin.  Xi I would rank next to them.   But still significantly higher because he’s only genocided a little bit instead of entire continents.


Some of my differences are probably just how he did the survey and it didn’t differentiate at the lower end well.  And when you dislike someone like Newsome he gets the same score as someone really bad like Hitler.  A 10 point scale would have likely shown bigger gaps.  The scoring would scare me that we are far closer to civil war but I think that’s just the methodology.  I might dislike a lot of Democrat establishment but not at that level.

Personally was waiting for someone else to post these surveys.  The overlap in communities seemed strong.  I wouldn’t be surprised if he sources ideas here and I’ve had conversations with him.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ik05nvf/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik01wij/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Has anyone obtained value from the ikigai / kanban / self-authoring / etc progra</title><updated>2022-08-12T14:48:29Z</updated><author><name>Difficult_Ad_3879</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">Has anyone obtained value from the ikigai / kanban / self-authoring / etc programs?

While his life and death aren&#39;t culture wars material per se, I wanted to mention his passing because his work was *immensely* influential on me as a kid. Specifically, when I was about 7 years old, I read his graphic novel [When The Wind Blows](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/When-the-Wind-Blows), and accidentally saw [the TV adaptation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pJKdTqYijY) a few years later. In a departure from his previous work aimed at children, this was a &#34;comic book&#34; about nuclear war. Even more specifically, it&#39;s about an elderly English couple who follow every bit of government advice, and slowly, painfully die of radiation sickness in the wake of a nuclear attack on the UK.

I cannot emphasise enough how much anxiety and trauma this caused me as a child. I was lucky enough to avoid a religious upbringing, but suddenly, I became aware of civilisational-level threats and the horror of the apocalypse. I literally took weeks off school because I was vomiting from fear of nuclear attack, a condition that only eased when puberty hit and I became worried about much more sensible things like not having a large enough penis.

While at some level I resent Briggs (and my parents!) for exposing me to such existential horror at such a young age, I&#39;m also very grateful. I do think the world is a safer place in virtue of this kind of protest comic. It also set in motion a lifelong coping strategy for me - when faced with something terrifying, I resolved to learn as much as possible about it, so that the emotional was replaced by the intellectual. In my late prepubescent years, I became fascinated by nuclear weapons and prepping, and to this day, I make sure to keep potassium iodide pills in the house. Somehow by turning horrors into intellectual problems, they lose their terror.

In any case, Raymond Briggs&#39;s work helped make me who I am today. May the man rest in peace, and his work continue to (appropriately, within reason) traumatise generations yet to come.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijx1bm6/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijwypi3/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Another entry in the Inflation Reduction Act effort, this time covering some of </title><updated>2022-08-11T21:57:44Z</updated><author><name>xablor</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Another entry in the Inflation Reduction Act effort, this time covering some of the proposed uses of all that money. u/Sorie_K and u/netstack_ ably covered the huge Title I, and I attempted to cover as much of the rest as I could, working backwards. I&#39;m more than out of time, but I&#39;m pleased that I managed to line-by-line Titles II through VIII, some 200 pages, so here&#39;s my attempt at a summary. This will necessarily be high-level; my low-level summaries are available at [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative\_analysis\_of\_the\_inflation\_reduction/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative_analysis_of_the_inflation_reduction/), with a top level thread for each title, and summaries under each.

My first impression is of how /sane/ all this seems - accepting the premise that we will all literally die if we&#39;re not net-zero by 2050 (or whatever goal is being set for whatever reason, don&#39;t @ me) - this is a legitimate full-court press to electrify GHG producers, enable consumer and industrial deployment of low-emissions tech and enhanced energy efficiency, deploy renewable energy at scale, adapt to incoming warming and extreme weather, and enable research into new forms of renewable energy. I&#39;m not cynical enough to reliably detect opportunities for patronage and corruption, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s there, but a LOT of these funds are pretty tightly targeted. They&#39;re even market-y in most places: using them for loan guarantee programs is frequently explicitly allowed, public/private cost sharing is sometimes required. The whole thing reads as though you asked 7 different specialist committees to ask their SMEs to dig out their best ideas, harden them into operationalizable proposals, and then have the lawyers translate it into Congress-flavored legalese.

As a wrinkle that I&#39;m not sure how to fit elsewhere, there&#39;s a good chunk of money allocated for environmental review improvements: S70007 gives 70M to the Environmental Review Improvement Fund under the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council; S60402 gives 30M to the Council on Economic Quality for general operations and review enhancements; S60115 gives EPA 850M for improved review and permitting processes; 40003 gives NOAA 150M for improved review and permitting processes; S50301, -2, -3 gives 375M for improvements to environmental reviews and authorizations to Sec of Energy, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Sec of Interior; S23001 gets 100M to provide more effective and efficient reviews. This totals 1.575B, casually. I happened to run across a passed Senate Resolution in the Congressional Record for 2022-8-4 that would undo a rule currently requiring environmental impact statements to include indirect and cumulative impacts; it&#39;s S J Res 55 for this Congress, it&#39;s got all 50 Republicans and 0 Democrats, and /I don&#39;t understand why/. It&#39;s referred to House Committee, where it&#39;ll die or get stonewalled, but it&#39;s an interesting opening for construction maximalism, which seems necessary to achieve the construction bandwidth needed for all these large-scale climate projects. I really hope that someone wiser than me can weigh in here, because I have no idea what to make of this development that smells so much of the Shadow Congress quietly getting big things done.

Of the functional goals of the bill given in the one-page summary at [https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22122297-inflation\_reduction\_act\_one\_page\_summary](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22122297-inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary) , these titles only implement #2: &#39;Lowers energy costs, increases cleaner production, and reduces carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030&#39;. This is is only slightly duplicitous:  there are programs for retrofitting cleaner and more efficient industrial processes, and under ideal conditions and friendly analysis 40% reduction from predicted emissions is achievable, but the energy costs aspect seems to be on the demand side, due to more newer and more efficient appliances, better insulation and sealing, demand-shifting tech, and distributed power generation via rooftop PV and thermal solar.

I didn&#39;t pick up on a lot of opportunities for diversion, patronage, winner-choosing, vote-buying, or similar abuses, though of course the sheer scale makes waste and fraud inevitable. Most Inspector General offices are getting additional funding, which should help. S13103 is specifically for solar and wind facilities serving low-income communities. 22004 is about disadvantaged rural communities. S50121 sets aside money specifically for encouraging work in underserved communities. 50231 is specifically for water supply projects for disadvantaged communities. 60103 targets GHG emissions in disadvantaged communities. 60104 tries to reduce diesel emissions in poor communities. 60105 targets air quality sensors in low-income communities. 60106 targets air quality emissions at schools in poor communities. 60201 is specifically for &#34;Environmental and Climate Justic Block Grants&#34;, and is fairly blatantly loose, including &#34;facilitating engagement of disadvantaged communities in State and Federal public processes&#34;. 60501 tries to fix highways cutting poor neighborhoods in half, improving walkability. Nonprofit orgs are eligible for grants for a few sections, but the purposes are usually tightly scoped. S4001 targets nonprofits &#34;to enable coastal communities to prepare for extreme storms and other changing climate conditions&#34;, which strikes me as usefully loose.

I&#39;m out of words, here, please let fly with comments,  corrections, or followup questions I can work on.

A pithy statement of it is &#34;Never dine alone with a woman&#34;. For Pence, it goes a bit further and he also won&#39;t consume alcohol without his wife present.   
  
When this came to light after Pence&#39;s vice presidential nomination in 2016, it inspired a furor overnight. Some [claimed it was sexist](https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-abcarian-pence-marriage-20170405-story.html), [Kamala Harris called it &#34;outrageous&#34;](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/14/kamala-harris-pence-women-1221741), and some commentators have even [questioned its legality](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/3/31/15132730/pence-women-alone-rule-graham-discrimination). On the other hand, you have people claiming this is good or inevitable. [One example of the latter](https://wyborcza.pl/Jutronauci/7,165057,25453074,dukaj-wyrazam-niewiare.html) comes from a Polish sci-fi author some of you may be familiar with. In his opinion, movements like #MeToo make Pence&#39;s personal code of etiquette unavoidable because there aren&#39;t other ways to avoid the implied &#34;New Puritanism&#34;. Quoting from [the *Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/pence-wife-billy-graham-rule/521298/), &#34;Socially liberal or non-religious people may see Pence’s practice as misogynistic or bizarre. For a lot of conservative religious people, though, this set-up probably sounds normal, or even wise. The dust-up shows how radically notions of gender divide American culture.&#34; With a description as apt as that, whatever you feel about it, Pence&#39;s personal is now [certainly political](https://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=0ba7b595-8da9-4e63-a0ec-aec0639e4af6).  

So what happens when we have a society-wide experiment in forcing Pence&#39;s rule on people? [A recent preprint](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105976) alleged that was exactly what happened in the area of economic research. The TL;DR of the result is that post-#MeToo, male economists became more wary of collaborating with female economists. This effect was stronger when university policies on &#34;impersonal harassment&#34; were more ambiguous and when the number of past public sexual harassment cases at a university was higher. The effects are a bit scattered, but some clear findings ring out. Despite their proportions of the sample remaining unchanged despite #MeToo, female economists became less productive afterwards. This reduced productivity can be substantially (60%) attributed to the direct effects of having fewer collaborations with male economists, whose own productivity hasn&#39;t been affected. The effect on female economists&#39; productivity was broad. Female economists were not less likely to work with women alone or women and men together, but they were less likely to work with men alone. This extended to new projects and new papers. They were not less likely to collaborate with untenured colleagues, but they were less likely to collaborate with tenured people, and this seems to be due to the fact that the tenured colleagues were at higher-ranking universities, which saw larger reductions in cross-sex collaboration. After #MeToo, female economists were less likely to initiate new projects with new and existing coauthors and this effect was due to reductions in the numbers of new projects with new coauthors inside the university and of new projects with new coauthors outside of their university. The same pattern was seen for coauthorships more generally.   

So this paper argues that what happens when we start practicing what we&#39;re told in 2 Timothy 2:22 is that women take a professional hit. The author of this paper offered [two](https://twitter.com/marinambgg/status/1557714978747981824) [stories](https://twitter.com/marinambgg/status/1557714981587546114) to explain these results.  

&amp;gt;Men think “#MeToo means if I accidentally say the wrong thing, I’ll be cancelled/fired. I’d better stay away from women.” Clear policies show that “saying the wrong thing” doesn’t get you cancelled/fired, so clear policies reduce men’s (perceived) risk of #MeToo. 

and  

&amp;gt;Women think “#MeToo means I don’t have to work with the predator men anymore, so I’ll avoid them.” If that’s the story, we should see the decrease in collaborations regardless of whether policies are clear or not.  
 
And, to be fair, both of these stories might be true to different degrees. Policy ambiguity does not explain the whole reduction in collaborations. Because this *is* the case, unless the authors&#39; policy ambiguity measures weren&#39;t good enough, her suggestion that &#34;#MeToo plus clear policies could create awareness for sexual harassment without hurting women’s productivity&#34; may be misguided. Sure, ambiguity reduction looks like it could cut against these changes a bit, but if we trust her measurement we have to conclude that the damage is done. #MeToo has made us all evangelicals, and women are some of the victims of that change.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijwb99h/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijvrw9p/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Are we seeing a correction in practice for transgender issues?

I&#39;ve seen several signals this year that indicate the tide is shifting away from the affirmative care model.

[The Tavistock clinic](https://archive.ph/TM9LO#selection-295.52-299.145) has been shut down.  The NYT makes it sound like long waitlists are the main reason the UK is ditching this model, but another very strong reason is because the clinic ignored mental health issues in favor of beginning medical transition.  The clinic faces a [class action lawsuit](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/4e7fc538-18dc-11ed-b1f4-627a202c7457?shareToken=8c10508fb9e9acdd02579f7a5207924c) from families who believe their child was negligently misdiagnosed by the clinic.  

An independent review of the Gender Identity Development Service by [Dr Hilary Cass](https://cass.independent-review.uk/publications/interim-report/) appears to be a significant catalyst.  The key points from an interim report are:

&amp;gt;The rapid increase in the number of children requiring support and the complex case-mix means that the current clinical model, with a single national provider, is not sustainable in the longer term. 

&amp;gt;We need to know more about the population being referred and outcomes. There has not been routine and consistent data collection, which means it is not possible to accurately track the outcomes and pathways that children and young people take through the service.  

&amp;gt;There is lack of consensus and open discussion about the nature of gender dysphoria and therefore about the appropriate clinical response. 

&amp;gt;Because the specialist service has evolved rapidly and organically in response to demand, the clinical approach and overall service design has not been subjected to some of the normal quality controls that are typically applied when new or innovative treatments are introduced.   

Finland and Sweden have likewise changed their guidelines on how to treat gender dysphoria in children.  The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare has released a [new set of guidelines](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/globalassets/sharepoint-dokument/artikelkatalog/kunskapsstod/2022-3-7799.pdf):

&amp;gt;For adolescents with gender incongruence, the NBHW deems that
the risks of puberty suppressing treatment with GnRH-analogues
and gender-affirming hormonal treatment currently outweigh the
possible benefits, and that the treatments should be offered only in
exceptional cases. This judgement is based mainly on three factors:
the continued lack of reliable scientific evidence concerning the
efficacy and the safety of both treatments [2], the new knowledge
that detransition occurs among young adults [3], and the uncertainty that follows from the yet unexplained increase in the number
of care seekers, an increase particularly large among adolescents
registered as females at birth [4]

[Finland released a report with similar guidelines.](https://segm.org/sites/default/files/Finnish_Guidelines_2020_Minors_Unofficial%20Translation.pdf)  

Overall it seems to me that parts of Europe are moving more towards the *actual* Dutch protocol and becoming more cautious about providing medical interventions to gender non-conforming youth.  I have not seen any evidence that this shift might happen in America or Canada though.  Is America lagging behind Europe or is the affirmative care and informed consent model here to stay?  

Lastly, the reason this post came together today is because of a thread in the SeattleWA subreddit.   There are a few Seattle subreddits, SeattleWA is the more right-leaning.  It&#39;s still pretty left leaning, earlier this week there were people arguing against voting for an independent candidate in case they were a secret Republican.  (They were not, they are actually further left of the Democratic candidate.)  So it&#39;s &#34;right for Seattle&#34; which is still pretty left for much of America.  

Someone posted a link to a news article about a YMCA transwoman employee being harassed by an 80 year old woman who felt there shouldn&#39;t be a male helping little girls pull down their swimsuits to go potty.  The old woman was banned from the Y due to the incident.   I would expect the comments to be supportive of the trans employee and less supportive of the old lady.  However, that is not what happened.  [See here](https://archive.ph/bdp2r), but most people felt like they wouldn&#39;t want a transwoman helping their small daughters use the toilet.  

Other recent events like Lia Thomas&#39; infamy seems to indicate that people don&#39;t really mean &#34;Trans women are woman&#34; in all situations.  I&#39;m wondering if we&#39;ll see an ideological shift happen in America before we see a medical care model shift.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijvrw9p/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijurnpj/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] [deleted]</title><updated>2022-08-11T13:26:48Z</updated><author><name>[deleted]</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">[deleted]</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijurnpj/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijtgwi4/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] EDIT: [My apologies, this may have all been bullshit.](https://twitter.com/Ashle</title><updated>2022-08-11T04:36:10Z</updated><author><name>HalloweenSnarry</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">EDIT: [My apologies, this may have all been bullshit.](https://twitter.com/AshleyLatke/status/1557430756267511808) Original post follows below.

Dispatches from the War on Horny, per Dexerto: [OnlyFans bribed Meta into suppressing competitor sites by having models on said sites labeled as &#34;terrorists&#34; on FB and Instagram.](https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1557491228232622081)

I&#39;m reminded of the recent story about PredictIt losing the legal cover it had, along with the allegation that rival site Kalshi basically engaged in [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) to get the CFTC to not only approve them, but de-approve PredictIt.

This is a story not merely about how society treats sex work, but more about how sex work is the canary in the coal mine that often exposes the ways in which our economic system fails. First there was deplatforming and the impossibilities of &#34;building your own&#34; (a story that also involved OnlyFans), now there is the reminder that sufficiently-large actors can wield enough clout to just *ask* platform-holders to essentially put their competitors out of business. Now, if you&#39;re reading this, chances are you&#39;re likely about to respond about how government regulation actually enforces monopolies, but this story is about Facebook (granted, maybe this isn&#39;t much different depending on how much you believe that FB is essentially an arm of the US Government), who effectively controls a large chunk of the modern surface internet.

It&#39;s one thing for there to be rules and regulations in place, but much of our legal landscape is in effect very malleable and prone to change on the say-so of ultimately-human agents. Of course, I know that money and words have always been weaknesses in our democratic institutions, but this is just more grist for the mill of &#34;the real power is not just in Washington.&#34;</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijtgwi4/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijsuiyy/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] For a blast from the past, [Alex Jones has just finished up with a one of multip</title><updated>2022-08-11T01:32:43Z</updated><author><name>DrManhattan16</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">For a blast from the past, [Alex Jones has just finished up with a one of multiple lawsuits he&#39;s involved in](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/alex-jones-law-suit-verdict-sandy-hook-case-scare-conspiracy-theorists-rcna41828).

The lawsuits were about his messages calling Sandy Hook a fake school shooting and saying the parents were crisis actors. Jones obviously moved on once the shooting was no longer relevant, but his actions led to his followers harassing the parents in question. Some accounts of that harassment can be found here: [1](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/09/the-sandy-hook-hoax.html), [2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/08/sandy-hook-hoaxer-gets-prison-time-for-threatening-6-year-old-victims-father/). It&#39;s difficult to conclusively define his impact, so I can&#39;t really say if he&#39;s the originator of the hoax claim. There are more conspiracy theorists with large followings than Jones, and ideas can occur independently at the same time. But Jones&#39; status makes it likely many people heard the &#34;Sandy Hook was a hoax&#34; line from him in one way or the other and some acted on it.

A big point about this lawsuit and Jones&#39; conduct in general has been the refusal to obey judicial orders or not follow court rules in general. Jones, his lawyers, his company, and whoever was involved in his defense don&#39;t seem to have done a very good job, his lawyer straight up sent Jones&#39; phone records to the plaintiffs&#39; lawyer, who said that Jones basically lied about actually trying to see if he had any records about Sandy Hook.

That said, [he&#39;s admitted under oath that he does think the school shooting actually happened](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/sandy-hook-parents-alex-jones-claims-created-living-87866827), which seems on brand for Jones as someone who doesn&#39;t actually believe what he&#39;s saying. Of course, he added that he&#39;d apparently love to recant his mistake, but the media won&#39;t let him. He&#39;s also said he apparently wanted to apologize to the parents, but given how many years its been, it&#39;s clear this is throwing anything at the wall to see if something sticks.

The lawsuits are not satisfying for anyone, I think. Jones&#39; defenders can tell themselves that this trial was really only decided by legal technicalities and the actual facts were never put under examination, a similar claim to one that some people here have made regarding 2020 election lawsuits. For those who want to see Jones taken down, the amount of money is basically nothing to him. Some are calling for Jones to see trial for perjury (he lied multiple times under oath in this trial) and his phone records are apparently being sent at request to the Jan 6th committee, so look forward to that in the future.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijsuiyy/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijrj3bk/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Aight lads, the moment of reckoning is here for me.

I&#39;ve always wanted to flee from India for fairer shores, and while the NHS might be slowly imploding, it&#39;s *still* miles ahead of what I have to deal with here.

I&#39;ve been preparing for the British medical licensing exam there for almost a year, which is probably the longest I&#39;ve ever been able to focus on a task, although the bulk of the focused prep was in the past 3 months. And for once, I don&#39;t have that typical ADHD anxiety the night before the test, because I genuinely know I&#39;ve done all I can, I score well above the cutoff in practise tests, and unlike pretty much every exam I&#39;ve ever given, I don&#39;t find myself desperately cramming the night before to make up for not bothering before.

Maybe it&#39;s that this is something that I *want*, as opposed to entering medicine or making it through med school, a decision prompted more by the fact that there wasn&#39;t any other profession I preferred, rather than a genuine passion for it. I mostly phoned it in then, but faced with the prospect of finally striking out on my own, and making something of myself in foreign shores, I actually did things right for once.

In fact, I have more anxiety about my *lack* of anxiety than anything else, to know that I&#39;m probably going to make it through regardless of reckless scrambles is a novel feeling for me.

Wish me luck, while this isn&#39;t the end of the journey by any means, it&#39;s the first milestone along the way, and I genuinely hope I make it through. The grass may or may not be greener on the other side, but I&#39;m determined to find out for myself..</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijrj3bk/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijr0gxb/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Today marks four years since Richard Russell stole a plane from SeaTac airport, </title><updated>2022-08-10T18:12:41Z</updated><author><name>SaxifragetheGreen</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Today marks four years since Richard Russell stole a plane from SeaTac airport, did a barrel roll, then crashed into a remote island. RIP Skyking.

This story has always held my attention, and I must admit to a certain amount of wistful fascination with the entire episode. The story of a nobody who does something extraordinary, even though it meant his death. There&#39;s something glorious about it. Despite the need to avoid glorifying a man stealing an airplane to take it on a joyride, I can&#39;t help but admire him. 

There aren&#39;t many other things I can think of that are simultaneously ill-advised and wonderfully glorious. The one that came to mind, that has a similar feeling to me, is Alex Honnold, the man who freeclimbed El Capitan. Like stealing an airplane, freeclimbing El Capitan is ill-advised, and yet undeniably glorious. Obviously Alex didn&#39;t have to steal anything, and Alex didn&#39;t die doing it. Alex planned, and didn&#39;t break any laws. But still. The feeling I get from both resonate, harmonize. Maybe it&#39;s close to the admiration I have for Ted Kaczynski, who more than all else lived his morals and implemented them as he saw fit. Of course, while Alex didn&#39;t kill anyone and didn&#39;t die, and Richard didn&#39;t kill anyone but himself, Ted killed other people, and is still alive (for now). Ted&#39;s not glorious, not like Alex, not like Richard, even. Maybe I&#39;m just a sucker for iconoclasts, and don&#39;t have the moral fortitude to decry their transgressions. Maybe I&#39;m just confused.

I don&#39;t really have a point with this post, other than to mark the anniversary of Richard&#39;s flight. I&#39;d be curious to know if this story affected anyone here like it did me, if anyone can recognize the kind of wistfulness I feel, and if there are any other people or stories who make them feel the same way. Maybe there&#39;s a German word that describes it, one I don&#39;t know.

The &#34;left-center&#34; anti-right alliance collapsed after 5 days when the leader of Azione (3% party, center-leftish pro-Draghi) left it when the PD (main center-left party) decided to include inside the Sinistra Italiana and the Greens (3% together) in the grand-coalition. 

Azione was also part of another small coalition with the Soros-funded Più Europa party (2%), alliance that collapsed with accusation of betrayal launched against each other. 

- the left accuse Calenda of being a liberal centrist always allied with fascism
- the center left and Più Europa, apart from the fascist libel, are also desperate because Azione was a party liked by a certain kind of leftish intellighenzia more near to the ex-Premier Draghi
- Calenda attacked everyone, saying that Pd and Più Europa did not respected the pact of forming a &#34;Pro-Draghi coalition&#34;, preferring the leftist parties

In general, the grand coalition is not working. The small left is candidating africans and gays, while the center left candidates neoliberal economists and feminists, while everyone complains that, if they are not going to sustain each other, the right &#34;will win&#34; 

The right has also internal problems (Especially with Berlusconi&#39;s Forza Italia, 7%, that lost a big chunk of the leadership to Azione after the fall of Draghi&#39;s government), but they appear more united and less catty. 

Medias are pumping stories daily on black people being beaten or discriminated or gay people, but the survey say that the right coalition can win more than 2/3 of the parlamentarians both in the chamber or in the Senate. 

While the right post cringe boomer memes as their method of propaganda, the other side is going hard on the &#34;vote us or Orban (!!!) wins&#34; 

It is not working.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijpo106/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijp7suz/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Worked out daily this month and did study.

I do get jaded and feel some brain fog later in the day but the moment I sit on my desk, it goes away like mist after seeing the morning sun. Same for my gym.

I did 40+ reps on the deadlift and squats on Monday and puked right after my workout due to having eaten nothing all day but 3 bananas. I am constantly hungry, sleep like a baby (slept for legit 10 hours yesterday night) and feel mentally sharp. I can feel my brain peak and dip, something I never could feel before as the entire day was foggy. 

I eat anywhere from 3 to 6 eggs daily. I would feel full at 2 earlier but feel hungry constantly now. My posture is much better. Deadlifts and Lat pulldowns fuck my back muscles up so much that I can feel them all day and they do not let me slouch. I have lost an inch or two off my waist even though I am underweight and gained a kg of weight so it is not fat.

I have done 12 videos on my playlist so far, aim is to get to 42 by the end of this week and ensure that I do 4 hours of solid undistracted work daily without fail or any breaks (by work I just mean Data Structures and Algorithms).

It is not much but I am a level 1 slime so leveling up takes time.

At least one tip to the police was from a redditor in the Albuquerque subreddit who methodically searched Google Streetview for the suspect’s Jetta, which had small but significant damage in one place.

The killer targeted local Muslim men, mostly Shia but one Sunni. He lay in wait for his victims, hinting that he knew them personally. The community was devastated by the deaths and was also devastated by the killer’s identity: a Sunni gentleman who was known to be a bit off his rocker, and seems to have been motivated by his son marrying a Shiite girl.

The Albuquerque subreddit, a progressivist haven as most default-named subs tend to be, instantly stopped calling for fire to rain down from Washington DC onto Albuquerque’s red-hatted bigots, and started thoughtfully bemoaning extremism and mental health issues. They did manage to find a few outgroup tags to apply to the suspect, whose shares his first name with his Prophet and a few of his victims.

EDIT: I was just reported for a violent comment in the Albuquerque sub wherein I said (before his religion and race were known) that I hope the suspect gets the death penalty, in the form of a public hanging, after a fair trial and all applicable appeals, instead of life in prison. I got the warning only *after* it became known he’s a non-white Muslim with longstanding mental health issues.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijothr6/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijngiha/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Is there even any point to right-wing political victories when the left continue</title><updated>2022-08-09T23:55:11Z</updated><author><name>Lorelei_On_The_Rocks</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Is there even any point to right-wing political victories when the left continues to control the cultural means of production?

The [Inflation Reduction Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act_of_2022) is, [as Michael Sweeney predicted](https://nitter.it/mtsw/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;q=inflation+reduction&amp;amp;since=&amp;amp;until=2022-01-31&amp;amp;near=), part of Build Back Better wearing a different hat, but adjusted significantly to appeal to Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Some Mottians [are doing a collaborative analysis here](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wc7x7s/collaborative_analysis_of_the_inflation_reduction/).

A central tradeoff is in [section 50625](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22122281/inflation_reduction_act_of_2022.pdf#page=644), which requires that for wind and solar to be developed on federal lands, two million acres of land and sixty million offshore acres of federal land must be offered for lease for oil and gas development. (Note that private and public lands are somewhat fungible, all offers are not leased, and all leases are not developed.)

Adam McKay and David Sirota are the screenwriters of *Don&#39;t Look Up* (previously [reviewed on ACX here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/movie-review-dont-look-up)), with 1.3 million Twitter followers between them. They&#39;ve been *very angry* about this deal. ([Example from Sirota](https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1556487558510821376), [from McKay](https://twitter.com/GhostPanther/status/1556745117838430208).) This has led to some [moderately funny beclownening](https://twitter.com/Wertwhile/status/1556278768674566145), and [is the same line being pushed by some Republicans](https://popular.info/p/the-people-behind-the-bizarre-non) attempting to derail the bill.

But I think there&#39;s something more interesting here. This reads to me as a very clean deontology/consequentialism split. If it hadn&#39;t been the leases, it would have been the [supports for keeping nuclear plants open](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-03/machin-deal-tosses-30-billion-lifeline-to-us-nuclear-reactors). From one perspective, anything that helps fossil fuels in any way is absolutely forbidden, therefore, this is a bad idea; from the other, we [see that the policy bundle reduces 24 tons of emissions for every ton it adds](https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Modeling-the-Inflation-Reduction-Act-with-the-US-Energy-Policy-Simulator_August.pdf), so it&#39;s net good, period.

There&#39;s a persistent belief on the left that there&#39;s a vast disaffected left-wing mass of voters who would show up for a sufficiently inspiring candidate. This was shown to be false when Sanders ran in 2016 and again in 2020, but it&#39;s *sticky* because it&#39;s nice to believe that everyone&#39;s silently on your side. Similarly, this portion of the left has been very keen to believe that [we can crush fossil-fuel supply, and it&#39;ll only affect billionaires](https://twitter.com/KateAronoff/status/1089327906139054080). The political reality is, of course, different, in that people [*really hate* high energy prices](https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Presidential-Approval-and-Gas-Prices.pdf), which is how supply restrictions manifest themselves.

I want to emphasize, not everyone on the climate-hawk left is taking the deontological approach. But it&#39;s certainly *interesting* to see this split.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijmqb7h/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijidq33/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] The FBI just [raided Mar A Lago](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/mar-a-l</title><updated>2022-08-08T23:40:38Z</updated><author><name>rokosbasilica</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">The FBI just [raided Mar A Lago](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/mar-a-lago-search-warrant-fbi-donald-trump/index.html) (Trump&#39;s home).

This doesn&#39;t seem quite *unbelievably* stupid, since, there is a lot of very stupid things that have already happened, so I can believe it, but...man this just seems like a really dumb thing to do.

There&#39;s no way this isn&#39;t a major step on an escalatory spiral.  What will the Republicans do to Biden when they regain power?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijidq33/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
