The argument about the glass shard strikes me as very odd. Of course it makes a difference if the child comes 5 days hence or a millennia. Within a few years we can probably expect the shard to be buried and rendered harmless. Within a century we can assign a reasonably high probability that the forest track has changed route due to natural subsidences etc. Within a millennia, who knows if any humans will be around at all? So valuing a clear and present threat equally with some theoretical future one seems utterly absurd to me.

Just as the impact of any action we might take is affected by compounding uncertainties, human life is also. Is it not clear that the life of somebody actually alive today is worth more than somebody who&#39;s parents are yet to be born? As one looks further forward, there is less certainty that the hypothetical people your action seeks to aid actually exist! Or even if they do, maybe they are genocidal maniacs that killed your descendants, or otherwise so alien in their values that you wouldn&#39;t Uncertainty in both regards compounds over time.

People obviously care deeply about their grand kids, and thinking of the US Revolution for example, have been willing to make great sacrifices to secure a future for many generations of strangers to come. The discount rate need not be extreme, and probably properly even varies depending on the circumstance (discounting one&#39;s own descendants less steeply than those of your extended family/community/nation/culture/species for example). Of course, one need not do this formally or numerically at all, but if you&#39;re going to build a numerical case for a particular idea, then it seems disingenuous not to at least consider including it as a term.

This sort of thinking is intuitive to me, and I think lines up well as a formalisation of actual human values and behaviour, but I&#39;m curious that I&#39;m not seeing anything like this discussed in the likes of Scott&#39;s OP or follow up &#39;highlights&#39; post for example. Perhaps I&#39;m off base?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im6axzq/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im5ub2m/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] So, what are you reading?

So minor spoilers for Stranger Things, on the character side.  Not the plot side.  They made Will unambiguously gay in season 4.  I hate it.  I hate everything about it.

I remember when Stranger Things came out, a lot of us 80&#39;s kids loved it.  It felt relatively authentic to our childhoods, especially being a nerd back then.  A group of us loved it so much, we got together for a retro AD&amp;amp;D 2E campaign.

The biking around everywhere.  The relatively undeveloped spread out suburban/rural town.  The total lack of adult supervision.  And of course, being a nerd super into something that utterly consumes your every waking thought.  And every moment spent at school is a moment you are patiently, or not so patiently, waiting to get back to that thing.

Probably the most authentic part of it, to me, was Will being a late bloomer.  Because myself and most of my nerd friends, damned near through highschool for most of them, weren&#39;t that interested in girls.  Even afraid of them to be honest.  And this often resulted in us getting picked on, beat up, and of course called gay.  Back when that was an acceptable insult to throw around at a public grade school.

Maybe one got a girlfriend.  But most had inclinations not dissimilar from the &#34;gay&#34; sentiments Will is constantly expressing, of just wanting to play D&amp;amp;D and Nintendo their whole life.  I can barely describe how much this character choice rubs me the wrong way.  In effect, it validates every bully we ever had who thought the way we were made us gay.

I donno, I hear there are some closeted gay 80&#39;s kids applauding it.  Good for them I guess?  Turns out culture truly is a zero sum game.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/im4j12s/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im4fqz4/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Has the Catholic Church ever admitted fault as an institution, or admitted as an</title><updated>2022-08-28T13:01:13Z</updated><author><name>ItsAPomeloParty</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Has the Catholic Church ever admitted fault as an institution, or admitted as an institution having been wrong about something?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im4fqz4/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/im4dege/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] (Sort of) New from me: [Anger At Student Loan Cancellation Is Justified](https:/</title><updated>2022-08-28T12:39:09Z</updated><author><name>TracingWoodgrains</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">(Sort of) New from me: [Anger At Student Loan Cancellation Is Justified](https://tracingwoodgrains.substack.com/p/anger-at-student-loan-cancellation?sd=pf)

This essay will be largely familiar to all who read my thoughts on student loans in the culture war thread [two years ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/jv161w/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_november_16/gckh5ca/?context=999). Given the current salience of the issue, I thought I should revisit and expand the essay to account for the actual loan cancellation announcement. Partially excerpted below, with a focus on sections not included in my original post:

&amp;gt; In other words, it&#39;s not that one already suffered and got theirs, while the other is suffering. It&#39;s that one got their reward (no debt) and the other got theirs (meaningful university experience), and now the second wants to get the first&#39;s reward too. It&#39;s a pure ant and grasshopper story. City Journal calls this the “chump effect”, policy that punishes those who follow prosocial norms while rewarding those who defect, ultimately degrading social trust and eroding those norms. [...]

&amp;gt; In saying all this, I want to be clear: I have no quarrel with those who got a genuine raw deal from college, those who were deceived by predatory institutions or pressured into attending schools they did not belong at, those who suffered the costs of university while reaping none of the benefits. Nor do I object to people who took out loans, secured upward mobility, and work to pay those loans back taking the write-off that has been offered. The core of my ire is reserved for the Nathan J Robinsons and Briahna Joy Grays of the world, the champagne socialists who agreed to student loans to build influence and prestige before using that influence to change the agreement retroactively—and for the politicians who yielded to pressure and altered the deal for political expediency. People are not grasshoppers for taking loans out or accepting write-offs when offered, but for accepting a cost to gain an edge over others, then turning around to demand those others pay that cost. [...]

&amp;gt; I vocally supported Biden in 2020 and have no regrets about that choice. Between almost any Democrat and Trump, I will pick the Democrat without hesitation, even with risks like this in mind. But my alliance with the left has always been an uneasy one, with no shortage of serious disputes. I am a politically unaffiliated centrist who recognizes that the value of my vote, inasmuch as it exists, lies in its willingness to flip. I have a small platform and a strong personal stake in this issue—while it’s certainly not the biggest issue in politics, it’s one that has a dramatically outsized role in my own life and where my own advocacy energy seems well-placed. I believe the Democrats should lose votes and political capital as a direct result of this cynically timed vote-buying to a larger extent than my own voice can influence, providing an impetus for them to change direction sharply before 2024.

&amp;gt; Given all of this, I will not vote blue in 2022. I cannot support a party that does not even pretend to understand my concerns, one that helps its activists gleefully wrest a bribe from the commons as they cynically claim to speak for the poor, one that arbitrarily frees a relatively advantaged group from their freely entered obligations at the expense of those who avoided those debts—then acts as if all who object are hypocrites worthy of no attention or respect. If this is the direction “progressive” politics is going, I want no part of it.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/im4dege/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/im497t8/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] So the USA is supposed to be this semi-libertarian, cutthroat, winner-take-all a</title><updated>2022-08-28T11:55:45Z</updated><author><name>ikeepfalling2</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">So the USA is supposed to be this semi-libertarian, cutthroat, winner-take-all and fuck the rest place, if you ever hear a non-American speak of the country. But it sure isn&#39;t! Somehow every big blue city managed to vote its way into high taxes and low law enforcement, individual states (RI, I forget about any others) tried to turn travel into &#34;papers, please&#34;, and the president forced every gov&#39;t employee to either take a shot (not discussing efficacy, just the coercion) or quit their jobs. 

So I&#39;m very curious - why do Americans suddenly care about their neighbors? How did the country go from &#34;fuck you, I&#39;m gonna do what I want&#34; to &#34;Heaven forbid I misgender you&#34;? What happened to the people that conquered every frontier they could find? I&#39;m not asking rhetorically, I&#39;m genuinely puzzled as to how the culture has completely changed, because it can&#39;t be as simple as a top-down change - after all, the USSR fell apart, and the state controlled the entirety of the educational pipeline. 

Here&#39;s the real question, finally: what made the general person in America suddenly in favor of redistribution? What got everyone to stop feeling like a temporarily embarrassed millionaire? And why did it work in the USA? It can&#39;t be as simple as a top-down edict, because if that actually worked, the USSR would still be around. And yet, country that was the antithesis of communism seems to be leaning in to the nanny state thing pretty hard. Is it just because the USSR fell apart and there&#39;s no longer any counterexample to warn away from? What happened to the nine scariest words in the English language? 

I just can&#39;t put together a model for the type of American that defines the Overton window. How on earth did the people of the most prosperous, most capitalist country change their minds?

My current working theory is that the Purutanisn that runs through the very core of the USA was suppressed for a generation or two (60s-10s or so) and is now reasserting itself. What is happening now is very much in line with Salem. Maybe everyone was just lucky to catch the industrial revolution and then the technological revolution and reap the benefits of the increased productivity to keep themselves occupied with their own prosperity, but now that technological progress has stalled (in the sense that there is nothing new being made, just incremental improvements) everything is back to how it was - segregation (look at all the skin color-specific affinity groups, both at work and at school), policing male/female interactions, etc.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/im497t8/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im3q30m/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] So, what&#39;s up with [excess mortality across Europe](https://www.euromomo.eu/grap</title><updated>2022-08-28T07:37:42Z</updated><author><name>D1m1tr1Rascalov</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">So, what&#39;s up with [excess mortality across Europe](https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps#excess-mortality)? This dataset received an update last week and has since created a lot of buzz in the vaccine-skeptic/anti-vaxx circles on reddit, Substack and Twitter, while receiving comparatively little airtime on more mainstream publications in relation to the (perceived) importance of the phenomenon. The basic finding is that elevated mortality has continued into 2022 and is currently on track to surpass both 2020 and 2021. This is particularly surprising given that we&#39;d expect a decrease in mortality now that a whole lot of vulnerable people have died already. Also note the sharp increase of mortality for people below the age of 44 and especially below the age of 14.

So far, the possible explanations I&#39;ve seen are:

* it&#39;s the heat wave,
* it&#39;s COVID itself or its long-term effects,
* it&#39;s the consequences from lockdowns, including staff shortages, treatment delays, economical and mental health fallout etc.
* and, most controversially of course, it&#39;s the vaccines

None of these seem particularly convincing to me. Why would e.g. heat waves and treatment delays be causing unusual levels of excess mortality for people below the age of 18? If it were the vaccines or lockdowns, the timing seems off. Europe is back open, mass vaccination happened last year at roughly the same scale and time in every European country, so why is Portugal&#39;s mortality going trough the roof right now while Denmark is mostly staying where it&#39;s at? COVID-infections might be contributing, but confirmed deaths are way down in basically every country and it&#39;s also not a known killer of young people. That widespread infections sort of shifted the general population health Bell Curve towards worse outcomes seems plausible, but studies on the side effects that don&#39;t look at vulnerable or severely ill subpopulations tend to come up with pretty unconvincing results IMO and again it wouldn&#39;t make sense for this to affect specifically young people.

Does anyone have a good idea for what&#39;s going on right now? Is it a combination of some of the mentioned possibilities? Or something else entirely? Or is it overblown, we should just wait a few months/a year or two and mortality will normalize?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im3q30m/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im2p5t2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Lex Fridman [interviewed](https://youtu.be/0ZO28NtkwwQ) Magnus Carlsen today. He</title><updated>2022-08-28T01:19:00Z</updated><author><name>Difficult_Ad_3879</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">Lex Fridman [interviewed](https://youtu.be/0ZO28NtkwwQ) Magnus Carlsen today. He may have used one of my requested questions, but I can’t tell as they were vague. Magnus is the most interesting case study of performance psychology because he’s so beyond his competition, in what amounts to the most competitive cognitive game in the world. 

Some interesting bits from the interview:

* Magnus does not like practicing with puzzles. Neither does he consider himself good at stand-alone puzzles. 

* Magnus hates strict, organized practice. He refused to do this as a child and instead enjoyed exploring interesting parts from books he takes a liking to. When he was younger he “fired” Kasparov as a coach (one of the best players of all time) because Kasparov wanted Magnus to analyze his past mistakes, which he found annoying.

* The above two bits are shocking as it flies in the face of our understanding of deliberate practice. But actually, maybe not! While it’s true that puzzles can be construed as very specific deliberate practice, you come across the scenarios in games anyway, in their “natural habitat” surrounded by other information; so playing difficult games is probably better than specialized puzzles. 

* While focusing on past major mistakes could be seen as optimal deliberate practice, it’s also highly demotivating. Magnus’ practice is odd in that he appears to choose the most motivating path. He reads from books guided by pleasure, and he ignores strict puzzle-based practices. He favors playing games, and if you notice, he very often plays these games with variable strategy in mind. Instead of focusing on one opening, when he plays online he frequently changes openings, tests out things he doesn’t know will work, etc. This is excellent deliberate, variable practice while maintaining motivation.

* While Magnus was the poster child of athletic chess players, in recent years he has fallen out of shape. I find it interesting that he favors sports games over weightlifting or cardio. This has a motivational component, because when he’s playing tennis for an hour or two he’s in a state of competition. I think this extra “competitiveness practice” aids him in chess. 

So I find it interesting that Magnus’ approach to chess prioritizes competition and motivation. I also find it interesting to think that if Magnus were placed in chess school with dry exercises and exams, he probably wouldn’t even make it in the top 200 students. He has a strong aversion to boring practice and is chiefly motivated by real competitive wins, and he’s not good at chess “practice puzzles”. This says a lot about modern schooling: what other talents are we missing out on because we focus on dry, boring practice problems that do not directly translate to real life? Have we missed out on Henry Fords and Da Vinci’s?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im2p5t2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im0xsgc/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] For the Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality fans here on The Motte, here</title><updated>2022-08-27T17:25:46Z</updated><author><name>DuplexFields</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">For the Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality fans here on The Motte, here&#39;s [Daniel Radcliffe singing an appropriately scientific song](https://youtu.be/rSAaiYKF0cs?t=32).</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im0xsgc/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilzle2b/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] I’ve noticed from social media that  skinny guys with low body fat get more fema</title><updated>2022-08-27T11:00:56Z</updated><author><name>Difficult_Ad_3879</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">I’ve noticed from social media that  skinny guys with low body fat get more female attention than those who have a gym body.

This wasn’t much—he was then living on a university stipend. “I think it’s O.K. to tell you this: I supplemented my income with nude modelling for life-drawing classes.” The postures left him free to philosophize. Later, he moved on to bachelorette parties, where he could make twice the money “for way easier poses.”

Some acted effeminate, some had a strange sense of humor, some were quirky, some walked funny or had certain affectations in their voice. Basically in all the standard gay stereotypes that we have as a society (or maybe in general? Do those stereotypes hold cross-culturally?). I maintained, as I was taught at the time, that just because someone acts that way, it has no bearing on their sexual orientation. They could be effeminate, but still like women. And as we grew up, guess what? Those boys all came out of the closet as gay, some in high school, some afterward.

I could see 3 possibilities:

1. The stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason. They acted that way because having those behaviors were highly correlated with being gay. Basically, liking men goes hand in hand with gay behavior, for most cases
2. Because everyone in their lives &#34;knew&#34; they were gay due to the way that they acted, they absorbed it into their own sense of self, and thus, essentially became gay. Basically, gay behavior leads to liking men.
3. Because they were gay, they saw the signals that you&#39;re supposed to produce in the culture, and subsequently acted them out. Basically, liking men leads to gay behavior

I&#39;m not sure which makes the most sense as an explanation.

I&#39;m still disturbed that I was the &#34;good&#34; kid, who did as I was told, and did not judge anyone or make assumptions about anyone based on their signals, just as I was taught to, and ended up being 100% wrong because of it. I also wonder if the popular perception in culture has changed, these days. With so much emphasis on identity, are people still taught that anyone could be anything, and that their behavior is uncorrelated to their sexual identity? Or does being gay go beyond just liking men, and it&#39;s more about performance than ever?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilx1wqg/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilx0jd2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] I&#39;m making a stupid parody game that I&#39;m planning to have devolve into a horror </title><updated>2022-08-26T20:32:28Z</updated><author><name>Karibil_Watar</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">I&#39;m making a stupid parody game that I&#39;m planning to have devolve into a horror scenario with humor elements, before circling the entire thing around to be a jab at a certain politician in another country with whom I have no beef. Anyway, via the game [Space Funeral](https://thecatamites.itch.io/space-funeral), which is a free and excellent two to three hour experience that feels like you&#39;re traversing a slightly humorous nightmare, I&#39;ve become more interested in older experimental music as a means of communicating an atmosphere of horror so that I can bundle it up with my already growing pile of copyright infringement. This has led me down the rabbit hole of early synthesizer music, starting with [Delia Derbyshire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsqxNy8kkg) with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Most recently, I&#39;ve been delving into Japanese Synthesizer stuff, which is frequently very pretty...

And then, there&#39;s 70s-80s French experimental music, which is good at stoking a sense of terror and sometimes downright miserable to listen to (as also is Derbyshire)

Not all the music I&#39;ve posted is good. A lot of it is discordant. But Space Funeral is pretty fun and if you know any other cool early synthesizer stuff that&#39;s good at creating an ambience, please shoot it over. Anyways, I am complete newb to this stuff and am not sure of how much interest it would be to anyone else. At very least, it you need to terrorize trick or treaters or your significant other during Halloween, some of these tracks will do a good job.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilx0jd2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilwbtis/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] A fairly heavily redacted copy of [the search warrant affidavit for Mar-A-Lago](</title><updated>2022-08-26T17:47:50Z</updated><author><name>huadpe</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">A fairly heavily redacted copy of [the search warrant affidavit for Mar-A-Lago](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854.102.1.pdf) has been unsealed by the court, as well as a redacted [govt legal memo regarding those redactions](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854.98.0_4.pdf) 

Biggest new things in the documents that we can see:

1.  The 15 boxes of documents provided by Trump to NARA in Feb 2022 contained:
 
 184 unique documents bearing classification markings, of which 67 were marked Confidential, 92 were marked Secret, and 25 were marked Top Secret.  An unspecified number of them also contained HCS, FISA, NOFORN, and SI markings. *(warrant affadavit, para 47)*

2. The DoJ investigation seems to be specifically centered around section (e) of the Espionage Act, which says:

 &amp;gt;Whoever having unauthorized possession of, access to, or control over any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted, or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it ... Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. *(warrant affadavit, para 8)*

3.  DoJ is saying that the warrant was in part based on evidence from &#34;multiple civilian witnesses.&#34; *(memo of law, pg 4)* 

4. DoJ presented Trump&#39;s claims about declassification authority to the judge before the warrant was issued, and released as an attachment to the affidavit [a May 25, 2022 letter from Trump&#39;s attorneys they provided to the court.](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-daec-dfd1-adef-dafe79d30000) *(p. 34-36 of that link)*</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilwbtis/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilvmmbv/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] So I&#39;m still greatly enjoying Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but I had to take a week o</title><updated>2022-08-26T15:05:01Z</updated><author><name>WhiningCoil</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">So I&#39;m still greatly enjoying Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but I had to take a week off to travel.

The job system hasn&#39;t really opened up as much as I&#39;d hoped.  I&#39;m like, 40 hours into the game, and all my jobs are still capped at level 10.  I can clearly see they go up to level 20, I just have no idea when/how I uncap them.  Will it be story related, or a sidequest?  I guess I&#39;ll find out.  But that obnoxious cap turns the job system from something fun, to a chore where I&#39;m constantly rejiggering my party&#39;s jobs because someone hit their cap, and I don&#39;t want XP to goto waste.  I can&#39;t fucking wait for the cap to go away.

The story is **very** Xenoblade.  If you&#39;ve played one, you know what I mean.

The geography and world design at first seemed very bog standard.  It&#39;s gotten much more creative and alien as I&#39;ve gone along.  It&#39;s funny though, because Xenoblade 1 and 2 both started off with monologs about &#34;This game takes place on the back of a giant titan(s)&#34;.  Xenoblade 3 just throws you in, with no explanation about the construction or orientation of the world.  I think it&#39;s still taking place on a titan?  Maybe the corpses of the titans from the first two games?  I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;ll be interesting if they just never fucking tell you, but I think I&#39;d like at least a few more hints.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilvmmbv/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilvknaj/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] They did it.

I was at a funeral, big Irish family, and all the men in the family seemed to be at extremes. Either 6&#39;3&#34; or taller and muscular, owned businesses or served in the marines; or on disability with some variety of genetic defect that prevented them from ever holding a job. It was a striking pattern, I meet one son who has had nine heart surgeries, the other son is on a scholarship and looks like the guy she tells you not to worry about. One daughter has muscular dystrophy, her sister is a judge.

I&#39;m thinking of other examples in my life. Twins on my little league team, one batted third and one batted ninth. Law school classmates in the top-5 of our class, who had siblings in nursing homes.

[&#34;BREAKING: Mark Zuckerberg tells Joe Rogan that Facebook algorithmically censored the Hunter Biden laptop story for 7 days based on a general request from the FBI to restrict election misinformation.&#34;](https://twitter.com/minds/status/1562927481945980928?cxt=HHwWgICwsfOQ0bArAAAA)

Zuckerberg&#39;s exact words are somewhat ambiguous:

&amp;gt;The FBI, I think, basically came to us, some folks on our team and was like &#34;Hey, just so you know, like you should be on high alert. We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically there&#39;s about to be some kind of dump that&#39;s similar to that. So just be vigilant.&#34;

By my interpretation, Zuckerberg is implying that his team acted based on the request from the FBI. Perhaps the FBI will have plausible deniability to assert that this was a &#34;general request&#34; rather than a specific demand to spike this story. Twitter censorship was even more aggressive than Facebook&#39;s, so it would be interesting to know if Twitter received similar requests from the FBI and if any of this communication referred to this story in particular.

Is Zuckerberg mistakenly generating controversy by apparently blaming the FBI for Facebook&#39;s decision to censor the story in the runup to the election? Or is he just being honest in confessing the truth on Rogan&#39;s show? Zuckerberg has always shown more personal hesitancy to engage in censorship, although in the past he has [ultimately folded in the face of enormous pressure](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54509975). I think he knows this will create more controversy for the FBI and he&#39;s signaling that he does not want similar requests in future election cycles.

But as we&#39;ve discussed recently, Facebook&#39;s content policy is now run by [ex-CIA](https://mronline.org/2022/07/14/meet-the-ex-cia-agents-deciding-facebooks-content-policy/) so similar requests for the cooperation of Facebook&#39;s moderation team may not even become known to Zuckerberg himself.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilt8n0u/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilsrtci/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] How to not feel tired after lifting?

So, Finland continues to bask in foreign attention due to the [prime minister&#39;s party scandal](https://alakasa.substack.com/p/the-stupidest-day-in-finnish-politics), with PM Sanna Marin currently ranking higher in [Google Trends than Taylor Swift.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F12vzpszb7,%2Fm%2F0dl567)

Developments during the week:

\- People continue to analyze the Instagram videos of Marin dancing, finding some indications that there might, indeed, have been drug use, ie. some people can faintly be heard talking in Finnish drug lingo and so on. Nothing conclusive, and the police announce that [they don&#39;t suspect foul play](https://news.yahoo.com/finnish-police-not-action-against-095348944.html/) related to videos. [Marin took a drug test](https://yle.fi/news/3-12588465), but since it&#39;s an urine test and not a hair test, critics claim it proves nothing.

\- Some major other local discussions: why wasn&#39;t Marin [formally on holiday when partying](https://yle.fi/news/3-12583726)? what if the Russians had attacked while she was drunk, or if there had been a crisis equivalent to the [MS Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_MS_Estonia) ship disaster? (Note: Russia has actually sent most of the troops in the Northwestern area to Ukraine, and Finnish crisis laws are written in a way that would nevertheless enable reacting to crises even if she had actually been in complete blackout mode.) Are the celebrities that Marin partied with high-status enough? (They&#39;re basically Instagram influencers and pop stars, and 5-10 years younger than 36-year-old Marin)? Is it all just media effort to get clicks and try to demonstrate they&#39;re not going easy on Marin for being young and female and leftist?

\- Marin was also accused of cheating on her husband (and the father of her child) when a [video turned out](https://www.is.fi/politiikka/art-2000009015380.html) where she&#39;s dancing with a guy (actually locally quite famous actor/singer Olavi Uusivirta) who is totally trying to get his mack on. I wouldn&#39;t say the video shows her cheating, unless she and her husband have agreed the other party can&#39;t even dance with the opposite sex. At least as far as I&#39;ve interpreted it, she&#39;s not really responding to her attempts and (I would guess) gently tells him to stop trying at some point. When asked about this video, Marin said that she thought Uusivirta &#34;was trying to whisper her something&#34;, which is quite silly, but a friend of mine, when we talked about the scandal, said that she probably phrased it that way since if she had said &#34;Olavi Uusivirta was trying to lick my neck even though I said no&#34; it would probably have been a career-ender for him, rather than her.

\- It turns out that two of Marin&#39;s celeb friends took a picture of themselves kissing while topless at Marin&#39;s official residence in Kesäranta, ie. Finland&#39;s Downing Street 11. This was widely considered to be inappropiate due to the official status of the location, as well as due to the idea that there might have been state secrets in the apartment. (One columnist even compared it to January 6, lol. If you want evidence about the mental American colonization of European politics...) [Marin promptly apologized](https://yle.fi/news/3-12589779).

\- There&#39;s a ton of news about this in foreign media, which is a huge thing in Finland in itself, since Finland is a country of 5,5 million people and, as such countries often tend to do, is hugely interested in all the cases where it is mentioned outside of its own borders, as [this meme, for instance](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/400x/12412665.jpg), indicates. (I&#39;ve heard that New Zealanders, for instance, behave the same way). Foreign coverage, like [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/24/finlands-pm-is-a-young-woman-in-power-her-partying-is-the-total-opposite-of-disgrace?CMP=share_btn_fb), seems to range from &#34;look at this hot PM&#34; to &#34;is this a plot by Putin&#34; to &#34;haha, it turns out that Finns are stuffy and conservative for hating their PM for dancing&#34;. As I&#39;ve noted, the actual criticisms aren&#39;t really as much about dancing as about the possibility of drug use in her vicinity and about the crises.

\- [Marin gives a tearful address](https://yle.fi/news/3-12591456) in Social Democratic party meeting, saying &#34;I am a human being. In the midst of the crisis, I have been thinking about Ukraine and about all of you&#34; (the [rest of her speech was about Ukraine](https://yle.fi/news/3-12589250) and shows the hardening of opinions in Finland about Russia, it wasn&#39;t just a random statement).

I&#39;m guessing that if there&#39;s not something new and conclusive turning up, the scandal is going to start dying, but of course something new and conclusive might very well turn up. Finnish social medias have been abuzz with constant suggestions there&#39;s new videos moving on around, including one journalist claiming that a video in the &#34;Thor network&#34; showing drug use, but this turning out to be a prank.

Disclaimer: This is some &#34;armchair general&#34;-level thinking put into words.

When the war began, I was afraid American support would soon disappear, come any newsworthy crisis. But it&#39;s been 6 months and support seems as strong as ever, at least judging by the recent 3bn military transfer along with the number of blue-and-yellow emojis on twitter. For many reasons, I think this war is not only a great chance to beat back Russian expansionism, but also to bring Ukraine closer to the west, hence why this question is important for me.

So--why do Americans seem so eager to help Ukraine?

My take is that it&#39;s mainly because they&#39;re acting out values that we admire.

Zelensky, for one, didn&#39;t run away and has remained deeply engaged throughout the conflict. As have many Ukrainians, both men and women, who chose to either stay behind or go back after the initial exodus. But it&#39;s not just personal courage that&#39;s delivered to us via news reports that we admire--it&#39;s also the example of national unity.

It struck me how low of an opinion Americans have to Afghans and Iraqis. The boots on the ground critique has focused on how cowardly or lazy their soldiers are, but I think the bigger reason for American disdain for them is their complete lack of national allegiance.  Perhaps I&#39;m talking out of my ass, but these two societies don&#39;t exactly fit the definition of society because they&#39;re more like a loose collection of tribes. In that sense, what they did made absolute sense: why risk your life for a different tribe? But from an American, even a Western perspective, this looks like a complete lack of skin in the game, especially in view of the recent news pouring out of the country of what their women are now subject to what with the taliban in power. The unspoken question is: why didn&#39;t they fight to protect their society and their way of life? (Taking into account a handful of individuals who did the needful).

I think Americans will continue to support Ukraine for the near future, at least another year or two because the Ukrainians are behaving in ways that Americans, irrespective of political leanings, can admire.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilq5bo5/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilpc6ix/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] If you were in the US, and you wanted to get semaglutide even though your health</title><updated>2022-08-25T07:01:10Z</updated><author><name>Flapling</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">If you were in the US, and you wanted to get semaglutide even though your health insurance won&#39;t cover it because you&#39;re not quite obese enough, how would you go about it?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilpc6ix/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/iloo9nm/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] What&#39;s a way that an intelligent person can make a &#34;part-time minimum-wage job&#34; </title><updated>2022-08-25T02:55:17Z</updated><author><name>Rowan93</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">What&#39;s a way that an intelligent person can make a &#34;part-time minimum-wage job&#34; tier income, that isn&#39;t the obvious one?

I&#39;m sure there are a variety of factors contributing here, but one that I think is probably a relevant is that violent crime is [disproportionately](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/revcoa18.pdf) committed by black people, so focusing on arresting violent offenders would necessarily result in disproportionately arresting black people. Or perhaps that black people received longer sentences under the current government 
 in the event that violent offenders tend to get longer sentences.  No one lobbying for the progressive, or perhaps even black, vote wants to be the focus of a headline saying that arrests of black people increased under their leadership. Conversations surrounding equity are simply not nuanced enough for the politician to be able to counter that there&#39;s more to it than those statistics, that it&#39;s just because they focused more on violent crime so people who commit violent crime were arrested at higher rates. And this could also explain why violent crime rates have gone up more in blue cities on a per capita basis. 

I just wanna say, I hate to be the guy to bring this point up. I&#39;m not just out here looking to take jabs like this, so if there is anything I&#39;m missing, definitely let me know.

My ultimate point is that I have to imagine politicians on the left looking for votes are not unaware of this reasoning.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/iln9sr0/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilmyik2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] I recently interviewed [Adam Mastroianni](https://twitter.com/a_m_mastroianni) o</title><updated>2022-08-24T19:50:31Z</updated><author><name>Pongalh</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">I recently interviewed [Adam Mastroianni](https://twitter.com/a_m_mastroianni) of Columbia University  - and sometimes comedian, I was surprised to discover - on a variety of subjects. I&#39;ve broken it up into two easily digestible chunks.   


[Part 1](https://youtu.be/M409oKluPYc) mostly goes into the nexus between psychology and econ/business. If you were pursuing behavioral econ, is that better accomplished in an econ department or psych department? Neither, try business school. The downside of general news consumption, as opposed to hobby or industry-specific news, is also covered.  


[Part 2](https://youtu.be/kQOBYOlQ_Jg) goes into pop culture consolidation, i.e. the endless reboots and franchise sequels/spinoffs. (This appears to be true even of video games and books.) There is some discussion of methodology, i.e. is a Nintendo game that features Mario at all part of the Super Mario Bros. Video Game Universe? Oligopoly in general is also touched on.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilmyik2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilmxnyb/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] I&#39;m on the autism spectrum and want to become as graceful as the average neuroty</title><updated>2022-08-24T19:45:15Z</updated><author><name>SkookumTree</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">I&#39;m on the autism spectrum and want to become as graceful as the average neurotypical. I understand that this might be a nearly impossible task; there are neurotypicals out there that almost never make social blunders...and this is not far from average, in my view. I&#39;ve been practicing lots, and have made some new friends...but I still get the feeling that they are basically secretly annoyed by me and only tolerating me out of a sense of pity and politeness. How might I get to the place where I think the average neurotypical is: seemingly effortlessly graceful, never making a mistake big enough to be put into words while sober. Watching two average people talk, to me, is like watching Olympic gymnasts or professional ballerinas. My therapist has been helpful - but she hasn&#39;t given me much that would help me get that level of grace.

Also: I find it interesting that people expect me, at 27, to have had some relationship history even though I am shorter than average and not that good looking - as well as being awkward. I wonder if they expect me to have, at least at some point, have bitten the bullet and been in a relationship with someone who I wasn&#39;t all that interested in or who had very real shortcomings that impacted them every day...maybe they were 300 pounds overweight. Maybe they had a drug or alcohol problem. Maybe they were no shit crazy and wound up in mental hospitals twice a year. IDK what it is. Is there any way that I could figure out how to accept being a nurse and caretaker to someone that is more or less disgusted by me? I&#39;d like to have a family, and if that is what it takes I&#39;d consider it, but it is a hard pill to swallow - being a single father, functionally, while also being a nurse and caretaker for a wife that is committing slow suicide. That takes toughness and discipline.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilmxnyb/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilmfcp2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] It blows my mind how thoroughly Trump’s 2016 campaign has been forgotten. What I</title><updated>2022-08-24T17:49:45Z</updated><author><name>Lorelei_On_The_Rocks</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">It blows my mind how thoroughly Trump’s 2016 campaign has been forgotten. What I mean is that Trump effectively ran on a single issue in 2016: immigration. He was going to “build the wall and deport them all.” That’s why he was elected, not because of “wokeness,” or “liberal elites,” or to end foreign wars or whatever. 

And yet that’s been almost entirely forgotten in the years since. Trump’s presidency was a resounding failure on the anti-immigration front, so maybe that’s why. 

But for whatever reason, today immigration has fallen almost completely by the wayside compared to 2016. On both sides. The daily “Trump bad” pieces in the media are rarely about immigrants anymore, they’re about Trump’s “erosion of democratic norms” or SCOTUS or whatever. The right on the other hand has been completely consumed by drag queen story hour, abortion, woke Disney and a dozen other stupid non-issues that don’t even rate in comparison to mass immigration. 

It really is incredible. Nobody cared about Trump, the man. They shouldn’t have, anyways. There wasn’t, and isn’t, anything impressive anything about him. There was a little novelty value at the beginning but it wore off pretty quick. The only reason he got anywhere was he spoke to something no other politician had the courage to: the wide-spread but socially unacceptable fears of demographic replacement among white Americans. 

(Incidentally, everyone recognized this across the political spectrum, except for neocon DR3 types. Well, they recognized it, too, they just pretended otherwise).

This is what had everybody in a tizzy in 2016, right and left. This is what made left-wingers fear turbo-Hitler, and what made right-wingers think, “hey, maybe we can actually get somewhere with this guy.” 

Unfortunately, most people are hopeless morons so this somehow managed to turn into a Trump cult wherein millions of brain-dead right-wing Americans worship a fat old real estate mogul as if he were a god and their millions of brain-dead left-wing counterparts revile him like a demon, with an almost complete disregard on both sides for the actual original source of his popularity. 

I’m not sure what point I’m actually making here. Maybe that when “did that TEACHER with BLUE HAIR just say her pronouns are THEY/THEM?” is considered by ‘conservatives’ as big (or bigger!) an issue than millions of immigrants entering the country every year and demographic replacement continuing apace with no sign of abatement, it well and truly is Over.

I&#39;m still kind of doing some work, but mostly just keeping up with absolutely critical stuff, and taking it easy otherwise.

When I was a kid and would get to stay home sick from school, I&#39;d always play video games. My mom wouldn&#39;t let me stay home unless I was actually pretty sick, but if I did, then I&#39;d usually get to play for a while. Now I have this association with being sick and playing video games.

So I&#39;m finding myself at home, sick, trying to find a game to play. But, I can&#39;t really even manufacture an interest for games anymore. Even after looking through a bunch of reviews, reddit threads, etc. I want to want to play something, but I can&#39;t conjure it at all.

Idk, has anyone else noticed a similar decline in interest in gaming over the years? I never thought I&#39;d get old and stop playing games. But, here we are, and I&#39;m only 30.

NYTs link https://archive.ph/xnYdN#selection-377.0-380.0 &#34;Biden to Cancel $10,000 in Student Loan Debt for Borrowers Earning Less Than $125,000&#34;

&amp;gt;At least 9 million borrowers could have their balances entirely cleared by Biden’s plan, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

&amp;gt;Biden’s decision to move ahead with $10,000 in student debt cancellation for borrowers who earn under $125,000 will cost the federal government around $244 billion, Kantrowitz estimated. The $20,000 in relief for Pell Grant recipients may add around another $120 billion to the government’s costs.

&amp;gt;The unprecedented action by the White House of wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer debt follows years of advocacy pressure and recent months of heated debate among Biden administration officials.

From what I have read, such figures are slightly misleading. This seems like a lot, but it&#39;s much less because it&#39;s not like the government was ever going to collect on all of that $300+ billion. It&#39;s not like owing $1+ trillion to a creditor, the service has already been rendered. This is also why Democrats seem to have more success at  a policy-wide level compared to Republicans.

I&#39;ve done one in July &amp;amp; August so far. I charge a small fee for coffee &amp;amp; pastries ($10), and a local nonprofit is shouldering most of the financial load in paying for advertising. (mailing postcards to registered businesses within the ZIP code) Tonight, I&#39;ll be working with a local marketer to start scriptwriting for online video content.

Results are mixed. Less than 10 people are showing up right now, but 3 are returning ticket buyers. Also, I&#39;ve had people on city council show up. An acquaintance also wants to shadow me next month to set up a similar service across the other side of the city.

So now I&#39;ve got to figure out how to keep pushing through the growth stage.  Current marketing (I&#39;m told) costs $500/mo, which is not sustainable. The 501c3 has told me I cannot operate as a business if I&#39;m to continue enjoying their support. It is possible to set up as a nonprofit with various designations (501c3, 501c4, 501c6) but I have to educate myself on the pros and cons of each of these. 

The biggest con for now: I am used to making executive decisions by myself, and I don&#39;t feel get warm fuzzies about forming a board.

**The ease of orthodoxy**

A few weeks ago I came across a Paul Graham essay I had missed when it first came out: http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html

The whole thing is good but I want to highlight this paragraph and footnote:

&amp;gt; To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the features of a religion. In particular it must have **strict and arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their purity by obeying**, and its adherents must believe that **anyone who obeys these rules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn&#39;t**. 

&amp;gt; The superficial demands of orthodoxy make it an inexpensive substitute for virtue. And that in turn is **one of the reasons orthodoxy is so attractive to bad people. You could be a horrible person, and yet as long as you&#39;re orthodox, you&#39;re better than everyone who isn&#39;t**.

That explains a whole lot. There are people who are held inline just by fear of crossing the orthodoxy, but even normal people enjoy the thrill of moral superiority.

And then there are the people who behave legitimately horribly but skate by by shouting orthofoxy. It is my default assumption for [mal](https://i.imgur.com/gcRoCAm.png)e [feminist](https://www.vulture.com/article/joss-whedon-allegations.html)s who are banking up brownie points because they know they are going to need them. They have karma and they intend to spend it.

So lo and behold when this week we get a perfect example, [Dan Price](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/technology/dan-price-resign-social-media.html). ([Archive link for NYT](https://archive.ph/TDCP5))

**You can count on journalists to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other options**

You remember Dan Price. If not by the name, then as the guy who took a big pay cut from his $1.1 million salary to set a minimum wage of $70,000 for employees at his company, Gravity Payments. He did this because he found it unfair to get paid so much. He got a huge amount of publicity from all the usual sources, doing appearances on the *Daily Show* and similar puffery. Rush Limbaugh, on the other hand, called him a socialist, which if Price was scripting this would be exactly what he would have asked for.

Then-at-Bloomberg reporter Karen Weise found out really quick [that there was a lot underneath the surface](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-gravity-ceo-dan-price/). ([Archive link for Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/v0wdA)). Price&#39;s brother sued him after the announcement because the brother was so mad about the wage increase, do you remember? Seattle Times and Inc magazine sure do.

As background, Price claimed his prior salary of $1.1 milion was set by market rates, but just compared to similar businesses and revenues, you would expect something closer to what was a third of his prior salary, so he was not giving up much. When Weise asked him about that in an interview, he changed the subject and ended the interview.

Well, the reality is that his brother Lucas served him with a lawsuit claiming he was being overpaid. And *then* two weeks later Price docked his own pay. To what level? I have not been able to figure that out, but it could have been &#34;slashed&#34; from 3x market rate to 2x market rate.

When confronted with this:

&amp;gt; In a follow-up interview in mid-November, I pressed Price about the inconsistency. How could what he told me about being served two weeks after announcing the raise be true when the court records indicated otherwise?

&amp;gt; “Umm, I’m not, I have to look,” he said.

&amp;gt; The court document, I said, definitely says March 16.

&amp;gt; “I am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise,” he replied.

&amp;gt; “The court record shows you being served on March 16 ... at 1:25 p.m.,” I said. “And actually, your answer to it was dated April 3,” also before the pay hike.

&amp;gt; “I am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise,” he repeated.

&amp;gt; I asked again how that could be, saying the declaration of service shows Price was served with the complaint, the summons, and other documents, “that you are a male, who is white, age 30, 5-feet-8-inches, medium height, dark hair.”

&amp;gt; He paused for 20 seconds. “Are you there?” he asked, then twice repeated his statement that he was only aware of the suit being initiated in late April. “I’d be happy to answer any other questions you may have,” he added.

What else could conme out? His ex-wife who did a TedX talk at the University of Kentucky where she read from her journal entries from the time she was married. “He got mad at me for ignoring him and grabbed me and shook me again.” ... “He also threw me to the ground and got on top of me. He started punching me in the stomach and slapped me across the face. I was shaking so bad.”


**&#34;What are you going to do, cancel me?&#34; - Man who was cancelled**

Weise relayed these quotes to Price, who said he was not comfortable responding when he had no evidence of such an allegation. He called back three hours later to remember to say that the events never happend.

Weise published her article and everyone who loved being in the room with him ran for the exits. Someone had called the emperor naked, and suddenly there were other things to do.

Taking a page from Bill Clinton, Price told his staff that his ex-wife was nuts and needed to be restrained, but admitted he should not have done that. A year later his staff spontaneously gifted him with a new Tesla because they loved him so much, which was another media set up according to his head of marketing, another employee in marketing, and the young woman who had at the time claimed credit for coming up with the idea. Price gives this recitation of facts the Sharper Image  how-dare-you-say-our-product-is-fake-when-this-hurts-the-feelings-of-our-customers-who-did-not-know-that treatment: “the idea that some people are trying to soil this cherished memory is deeply hurtful.” He was quickly forgotten again.

**Just tweet through it**

But Price was determined to get his spotlight back. He set out on a new quest to uncancel himself and hired an ex-Seattle Times reporter to shit out orthodoxy 24/7/365 on all social media channels.

He got back into the spotlight. Nick Kristof&#39;s NYT wrote [a lauditory opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/opinion/sunday/dan-price-minimum-wage.html) ([archive link for NYT](https://archive.ph/c5WU1)). Did it contain anything negative at all? Yes, it admitted there were &#34;bumps.&#34; Kristof links to the NYT&#39;s old story from when the narrative was that Lucas&#39;s lawsuit was in response to the pay policy. Kristof does not correct that narrative but knows better than to repeat it since it has been proven false by court records.

&amp;gt; There were bumps, no doubt about it. A couple of important employees quit, apparently feeling less valued when new hires were close to them in pay. The publicity forced Gravity, which processes credit card payments for small businesses, to hire additional people to handle a deluge of inquiries. Worst of all, Price’s brother, who owned a stake in the company, sued and alleged that Price hadn’t consulted him on decisions.

Nothing there is literally incorrect! Publish it! We are in the height of #MeToo but no need to publish accusations from his ex-wife TedX talk.

Oh, the ex-wife&#39;s TedX talk? Gravity&#39;s head of marketing called the University of Kentucky about &#34;potential defamation lawsuit&#34; and the university declined to publish it. This was known back in 2016 but no need to bring that up in a 2019 piece. Definitely nothing #MeToo relevant here, nosiree.

**You can count on journalists to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other options and then forgotten the previous narrative and then once again exhausted all other options**

So Karen Weise writes a new article at NYT (the first link). And it turns out that he has been building up his SEO as the standard male feminist to lure in women. Doug Forbesm, a blogger, had been collecting accounts of women accusing Price for years. No one, including the NYT, wanted to run the story so he blogged them himself. Besides his ex-wife we have:

* Serena Jowers filmed them having sex without her knowledge and three other women say he did the same to them.

* Another described Price having sex without her consent in the middle of the night.

* In a car ride, Shelby Hayne said he grabbed her throat and would not let go, and then drove donuts around a parking lot when he realized he was not getting any.

* Danny Askini said he pushed her against a wall when he did not invite her upstairs after a date.

* Kacie Margis did not know there were any warning signs because they did not come up in Google searches, and ended up in Palm Springs with him. She says she got locked out of their room while wearing a bikini, and later he had sex with her while she was asleep after taking an edible.

The Hayne incident ended up being investigated by the cops, which is what broke the dam and let everything else finally come out. 

He resigned as CEO so he could devote his energy full time to fighting the false accusations against him. As Karen Weise is writing this article, you can tell she loves rubbing it in the face of media, including the NYT that she is currently writing the article for. And she fucking loves juxtaposing Price&#39;s orthodox social media posts with his actual behvavior. Particularly his posts about how easy it is for a man to disprove false allegations. (-͡°-͜ʖ-͡°)☞

Current web searches are all about articles of his resignation so there may not be a third act for him.

The assault charge got dropped from the Hayne incident, but the cops had a gem they documented:

&amp;gt; According to the police report, Mr. Price boasted that no one had believed Ms. Colón’s allegations of abuse “because of who he is and that no one would believe her either.”

Bruen) to challenge New York&#39;s tweaked concealed carry license regime.

A primer for the case is [here](https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/2022/08/litigation-highlight-antonyuk-v-bruen/).

Plaintiff has moved for a preliminary injunction, and the state&#39;s response is [here](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nynd.133602/gov.uscourts.nynd.133602.19.0.pdf).

Time will tell how the court case is going, but this is culture war! From the primer:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

&amp;gt;New York’s reliance on Founding-era laws that sought to disarm disfavored groups such as Native Americans and religious minorities is sure to garner attention. But, of course, this isn’t a novel idea.  In a dissent from the Seventh Circuit’s 2019 decision in Kanter v. Barr, then-Judge Amy Coney Barrett posited that the U.S. historical tradition of gun regulation—including laws disarming “\[s\]laves and Native Americans,” although obviously unconstitutional today—supports laws “based on present-day judgments about categories of people whose possession of guns would endanger the public safety” (such as, potentially, those who have posted online about a desire to commit violent acts).

So what is this referring to? In the response, the state leans on this argument:

&amp;gt;2. New York’s Good Moral Character Requirement Is Relevantly Similar To A Long Tradition Of Anglo-American History And Doctrine  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;New York’s good moral character requirement is consistent with the long history in both England and America of disarming those whose *associations, reputation,* or conduct suggested they posed a danger to others or to the public order...

Italics mine

&amp;gt;From the early days of English settlement in America, the colonies sought to prevent Native American tribes from acquiring firearms, passing laws forbidding the sale and trading of arms to Indigenous people....  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;even after the English Bill of Rights established a right of the people to arm themselves, the right was only given to Protestants, based on a continued belief that Catholics were likely to engage in conduct that would harm themselves or others and upset the peace...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Virginia followed this example, passing an act in 1756 that ordered the disarmament of all Catholics or “reputed Papists” who refused to take an oath of loyalty to the colonial government. An Act for Disarming Papists, and Reputed Papisits \[sic\], Refusing to Take the Oaths to the Government (1756)

While all of this may be good law practice, it&#39;s red meat for the war. The memes practically [wrote themselves](https://i.redd.it/bh55uyi2mbj91.png).</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ill027f/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilkt0k3/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] As a short follow-up to my [wisdom teeth removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMo</title><updated>2022-08-24T10:48:12Z</updated><author><name>pmmecutepones</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">As a short follow-up to my [wisdom teeth removal](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vn8roc/wellness_wednesday_for_june_29_2022/ie60a3u/) post: got them removed. Awaiting future pain.

While I was there, I overhead a not-really private discussion between the nurses about the [removal of 377A](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-62545577). Some of them defended the decision to protect the definition of marriage (&#34;the religious feel threatened&#34;), others decried the move as useless because of it. But overall, none of them were interested in actually defending 377A directly. 

I&#39;m reminded of this passage from [_Neutral vs. Conservative_](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/01/neutral-vs-conservative-the-eternal-struggle/)

&amp;gt; In the hospital where I work, there’s a RESIST TRUMP poster on the bulletin board in our break room. I don’t know who put it there, but I know that anybody who demanded that it be taken down would be tarred as a troublemaker, and anyone who tried to put a SUPPORT TRUMP poster up next to it would be lectured about how politics are inappropriate at work. This is true even though I think at least a third of my colleagues are Trump supporters.

Why do I post this in the Wellness Wednesday thread? Well...

A few months back, I was really bummed out by observations like these. Like the Communist that seethes at perceived edifices to captialism all around him, I could not help but observe the prevailing attitude of mild cultural liberalism around me, and it brought me a significant amount of distress to think about my observations (which is to say, I upset myself daily). 

Today, I realise I&#39;m no longer upset by the observations I make, even though I still believe in the baseline conclusion that society is fundamentally biased. Above all else, I no longer despair, I no longer feel blackpilled, and I think this is because I plan to actually **do things** to change the world. An obvious lesson for the depressed among us: Make plans, get organised, and above all else -- try. The work of struggle, whether consequentially productive or not, will make you happier for the moment.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilkt0k3/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilkpsob/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] **What are non-Trumpists supposed to do about The Lie?**

By The Lie I mean the idea that the 2020 election was stolen. 

What are non-Trumpists supposed to do about the fact that the former President continues to push The Lie? Given that the idea that the election was stolen is both false and obviously false - which, let us be clear, both of those claims are clearly the case - what are those of us who can observe and accept reality supposed to do about the large portion of the population who can or will not? The ones who either have actually been fooled and genuinely believe The Lie, or else who are simply lying to themselves when they say they think that Trump genuinely won the election? 

From my perspective, there is not a good, democratic, peaceful resolution to this. Perhaps during the month or two following the election there was the (quite implausible) possibility that someone could genuinely believe the election actually was stolen, and we really could convince them with evidence. But at this point, it seems quite clear that the election was carried out well within the norms of how all elections in the USA are carried out. 

So what do we do about the people who continue to insist on maintaining The Lie? Given the failure of the soap box and the ballot box, at what point do we resort to other boxes? It seems quite plausible to me that anyone who continues to claim that the 2020 election was stolen is unlikely to accept the results of any other election going forward - once you reject one legitimate election, why not reject them all? And given the correlation between such and gun ownership, it seems very likely that such will result in violence, like it (attempted to) on Jan 6. What should the rest of us, who still desire for the democratic process to work and for the transfer of power to be as peaceful as possible, do about this?

I genuinely have no idea. All I know is &#34;oh don&#39;t worry, Republicans actually do believe in democratic values and care about the peaceful transfer of power&#34; has been demontrated to be a clear and obvious lie, and so we must not proceed as though it were true</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilkpsob/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/iljthrd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Anthony Fauci has announced his retirement.

Lots of articles gave glowing praise of a man I&#39;ve come to dislike. Which might seem mild, but I normally can&#39;t muster more than apathy for most politicians or bureaucrats. [This article](https://www.aier.org/article/goodbye-anthony-fauci/) captured a bit of what I dislike about him. A career bureaucrat most of his life. His handling of the AIDS crisis was unimpressive, and his handling of covid felt downright criminal.

I do hope there is some kind of come-uppance for this whole thing. Even if the only consequence he suffers is a public shaming, I&#39;d rather have that than just have him quietly get ignored. I doubt any of that will happen.

I do have wishlist coming out of the pandemic. The &#34;wish&#34; part in wishlist is very important here:

1. Accountability for top level bureaucrats. Politicians face elections, which is barely a form of a accountability, but at least it is something. Top level bureaucrats that control agencies should face some form of accountability. The heads of the CIA, FBI, and DOD should all have been torn a new asshole after 9/11. The head of the CDC should face congress after every disease outbreak. The head of the FDA should face congress for every bad drug, ***and*** every delayed good drug. Etc etc.
2. Accountability for dangerous forms of research. Gain of function research *might* not have caused covid. But there is way too much uncertainty. And it certainly did nothing to *prevent* covid. That is the whole point of GoF research, right? Slash the funding to nothing. At worst they were actively harmful, and at best they were completely useless.
3. Acknowledge how dystopian things can get without hard protections in favor of individual rights. China is the extreme case of &#39;no individual rights&#39; and they still thing zero covid makes sense. They&#39;ve locked people in their apartments, and starved portions of a city just to prevent covid cases. Certain areas of America were the only bastions of sanity in the entire world.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/iljthrd/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilj878k/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] **The site changeover work continues!**

I think abortion is a similar issue because, like &#34;equality,&#34; people on &#34;both sides of the issue&#34; today share much more common ground than they think, and are thoroughly blinkered as a result. 

The “anti-abortion” side is pretty straightforward, at least ostensibly. “Human life is sacred, fetus is human life, therefore no kill.” 

The “pro-abortion” side cannot dispute the idea that human life qua human life, that is, individual members of the biological species *homo sapiens*, is sacred and inherently worthy protecting. So they must marshal different sorts of arguments, appealing to bodily autonomy or the inhumanity of the fetus. 

Intuitively, to me, it’s obvious that abortion is not equal to murder. It also seems to have been obvious to most people through most of history, since abortion has rarely ever been considered equal to murder, by law or custom. Even when it has been considered unsavory and even criminal, it was not considered equivalent to stabbing a man in the street or dashing out an infant’s brains. 

Why is this? I think it is the same the reason that, in the classical world, infanticide was not considered equal to murder, either. Exposure was a common practice in the ancient world. Anti-abortion activists today are very fond of pointing out that the vast majority of abortion is not in cases of rape or incest, but simply in cases of a mother who does not feel she is “ready” or “capable” of taking care of a child. Likewise, in the ancient world, countless babies were exposed with the rationale, “just another mouth to feed,” or even, “don’t wanna take care of this thing,&#34; and thus left to die on rubbish heaps. 

Again, this was a practice that was sometimes frowned upon, sometimes condemned, though never outlawed as far as I know, but never considered equal to actual murder. 

This is because to be a full-fledged “human” it is not enough to be a biological member of the species *homo sapiens*. Humanity is contextual as much, or more so, as it is biological. To be a human means having a place in a social structure, obligations and rights. You have parents, children, brothers, sisters, friends, patrons, clients. You understand religion, history, civic duty. 

If a member of the species *homo sapiens* was raised by wolves in the forest, and grew up without language, human parents, friends, religion, ethics, or socialization of any kind, he would be morally equal to a wild beast and could be killed with the same impunity as a wolf. A fetus, or an infant for that matter, is in the same position. This is what makes abortion unequal to murder, if it is a crime at all. 

Modern anti-abortion activists cannot make this argument because they are, like their enemies, wedded to the idea that being homo sapiens makes one inherently sacred.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ili33i1/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilhv3u3/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] I&#39;ve been thinking about two US tax policies that seem to never go away despite </title><updated>2022-08-23T19:26:18Z</updated><author><name>russokumo</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">I&#39;ve been thinking about two US tax policies that seem to never go away despite broad popular support when explained to the public in plain English:
1) carried interest 
2) the step up basis for inheriting equities

The vast vast majority of Americans are not private equity managers (and probably don&#39;t know any....) or rich enough to have any inheritance tax levied on them. Yet the interests of the wealthy have bought the ears of our elected officials. The cost seems very very minimal too, maybe just a couple million a year of campaign contributions to a handful of pivotal senators to save tens of billions in taxes over time.

Even though the pundit class all knows about these, my suspicion is that the public doesn&#39;t care because these things seem like too arcane of details.

This to me is a fundamental unfairness within democracy. Yes technically we are a system of one person one vote, but as wealth can compound in an unlimited way AND wealth can be converted to equal political influence, we are destined to live in effectively an oligarchy.

Yes sometimes the oligarchies views can be swayed through naming and shaming and their offspring indoctrinated, but by and large we are much closer to 1$ 1 vote than 1 person 1 vote. Some among us may even view this as just in the sense that entrepreneurs who provide the most value to society should have a greater influence on society, but we&#39;re setting up a society where it&#39;s far more likely that someone who&#39;s rich is able to become an entrepreneur in the first place, ala Elon musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates. In addition to the genetic advantages of having smart parents, they also were afforded the connections and wealth to enable them to take risks.

With immigration of the best and brightest from around the world + randomness of genetics one generation to the next, there is still some chance of social mobility in the USA.

But I fear we are heading towards more and more of a static society of a late stage empire. Maybe with genetic engineering available and AGI light being owned by Google shareholders soon, we truly will revert to Neo feudalism, but gattaca style. Where everyone in society knows there station and doesn&#39;t bother rising above it.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilhv3u3/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ile306e/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Stable Diffusion was released to [public beta](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-</title><updated>2022-08-23T00:03:08Z</updated><author><name>Then_Election_7412</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Stable Diffusion was released to [public beta](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) today, complete with weights. In general, it seems comparable to DALLE2, Imagen, and Parti, beating them in some ways and losing to them in others; the most general comment I&#39;d offer is that it seems to do worse with semantic content and better with textures. This isn&#39;t too important: the next generation (which is to say, 6-12 months from now) will beat all of them in all their best aspects.

Aside from a lot of verbiage around using it ethically, the official and publicly hosted version includes a safety classifier that removes bad outputs. Yay? Of course, since it&#39;s open source, it&#39;s easy enough to modify the code, and the world got right to it. We already have the UnstableDiffusion and PornDiffusion subreddits, and there will be an proliferation of them and their content in the coming months without the need to dance around the OpenAI and Google ~~blacklists~~ blocklists. I mentioned this to a friend, and she said that at least we&#39;ll have a couples years before we could supply images of a person and have porn generated from them. I didn&#39;t have the heart to point her to [textual-inversion](https://textual-inversion.github.io/). Who&#39;d have thought porn actresses would be some of the first to fall to AI? If it&#39;s any consolation to them, many other occupations are going to be wiped out in the coming first wave.

It seems like society is not just unprepared for this but unaware of how far along we are in the automated generation of digital content. For awhile it seemed like the hope was that professional gatekeepers would protect us, but it was obvious that strategy just needed a single defector to fail. If it wasn&#39;t Stability, it&#39;d have been Yandex. If it wasn&#39;t Yandex, it would be a leak.

Regardless, now the cat is out of the bag. I don&#39;t think there was or is any way to prevent or stop this, or even that it&#39;s bad that it&#39;s happening. What does seem likely is that we&#39;re in for a rough ride as society reacts to something that&#39;s blindsided it.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ile306e/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
