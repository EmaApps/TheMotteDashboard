I&#39;ve had some decent amount of success with language learning apps like HelloTalk and Tandem, but seeing as these are gained primarily towards language *learning*, I don&#39;t really meet people in *my own* country/region via them - only foreigners. This kinda bums me out as every single one of my friends is too far away to visit comfortably, and I don&#39;t currently see the need to increase that number further.

This is something I&#39;d like to change, but I can&#39;t really think of any apps that suit the bill. Unfortunately, the app market is of the &#34;95% shit, 5% decent&#34; variety, so any tips that could speed up my process of going through the seemingly inexhaustible list of garbage-quality &#34;friend finding apps&#34; on the play store would be greatly appreciated.

Specifically, I&#39;m looking for something that *isn&#39;t* just another dating app clone Tinder-wannabe (like the top search results for &#34;friends&#34; on the play store all seem to be). But something more like the apps I mentioned above, where you can actually send messages to people, reach out, and form friendships based on common interests.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifwjyxh/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifvndpf/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] I have a quick question about birth order effects that I think people here might</title><updated>2022-07-12T17:02:38Z</updated><author><name>PokerPirate</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">I have a quick question about birth order effects that I think people here might be able to answer.

And I&#39;m not saying in this post that there are no good arguments about capitalism, I&#39;m only trying to understand the *modal* argument against capitalism.

I think people inherently don&#39;t like being told what to do. When someone compels you to do something, chances are it benefits them more than it benefits you, so we have an automatic reflex to assume that we&#39;re being shortchanged.

The weird thing is, when you look around at modern society, there&#39;s no one entity that really tells you what to do. If you don&#39;t like your job, you can quit at any time and no one will make you keep working. But then, if you don&#39;t have any job, you&#39;ll probably have to live on the street and that&#39;s not pleasant, so if you want to live a normal life you&#39;ll have to find *someone* who has money and convince them to give it to you.

The system that coordinates this is capitalism, so indirectly, the market forces of capitalism are telling everyone what to do. That inherently makes people dislike it, I think. You can ask yourself &#34;why am I doing something I hate every day?&#34; and trace the causal chain back and eventually you&#39;ll get to &#34;because capitalism&#34;. That&#39;s probably not going to endear someone to capitalism!

People won&#39;t say it explicitly, and it feels like of strawmannish to say out loud, but I genuinely think maybe 50% people who say things like &#34;fuck capitalism&#34; are imagining in their heads &#34;Capitalism makes everyone have to do stuff they hate all day and most people don&#39;t even get paid that much money for it. Wouldn&#39;t it be great if there were a system where nobody had to work and we still had our modern living standards?&#34;

Through this lens, a lot of arguments that seemed weird to me started to make sense.

1. The subreddit /r/antiwork. Enough said I think. Some people say that their real goal is just &#34;workplace reform&#34; or something like that, but I think that&#39;s just the motte. 
2. [Leftie youtube PhilTube made a video about &#34;bullshit jobs&#34;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_X-812q_Jc). If you&#39;re not familiar, [bullshit jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) says that half of all work people do in the developed world is pointless. If you look at his examples, like &#34;programmers repairing bloated code&#34;, I think you&#39;ll find this assertion a bit questionable. But you can understand why it&#39;s a very tempting idea: if half of jobs are completely pointless, that means everyone could work 20 hours a week instead of 40 with no loss in productivity! 
3. There&#39;s of course the preference for small businesses over megacorps. When a mom and pop shop hires you to work the register, that&#39;s not capitalism making you do it, that&#39;s just mom and pop asking you to do something for them and paying you for your time. They&#39;re probably giving you a good deal, right? But when Amazon hires you to work in the warehouse, even if they pay better than mom and pop and offer better benefits, suddenly is some weird foreign global system that&#39;s getting you to work for them. They&#39;re probably ripping you off!

Again, to be clear, I&#39;m not saying there are no good arguments against capitalism or anything like that. I think it&#39;s okay to look at bad arguments for position X, as long as you don&#39;t come away from that process thinking that those are representative of the best arguments for position X.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifvc3ol/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifu5vwr/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] In the UK the Tories are having a new leadership election.

For one reason or another a lot of minority candidates are in the race and people are talking about it. Much of it is presented as a reply to lawyer, full time virtue signalling tweeter, and [fox killer](https://barristerblogger.com/2019/12/26/should-jolyon-maugham-be-prosecuted-for-bludgeoning-a-fox-to-death/) Jolyon Maugham.

[This article](https://www.thenational.scot/news/20267870.jolyon-maugham-sparks-racism-debate-deleted-tweet-sunak/) covers the origin. 

[Of course the Conservative Party could choose an ethnic minority leader](https://capx.co/of-course-the-conservative-party-could-choose-an-ethnic-minority-leader/) says Sunder Katwala

&amp;gt; That ethnic minorities can reach the top of the political ladder matters – but it would certainly not make either Britain or the Conservative party a post-racial nirvana. While it will take more to shift the Conservatives’ share of the ethnic minority vote, the leadership contest sends a powerful symbolic message about the race to the top. The next challenge will be to develop the substantive agenda to deliver on that promise.

[In a more humourous article about poorly air conditioned leadership speeches](https://archive.ph/8pIpT#selection-1559.0-1559.144) Tim Stanley remarks 

&amp;gt; Actually, I think historians will write that the two notable things about this race were, one, it was incredibly diverse and, two, nobody cared.

Rakib Eshan says [The left’s problem with diversity](https://www.spiked-online.com/2022/07/11/the-lefts-problem-with-diversity/)

&amp;gt; The left’s unhealthy obsession with racial identity and ethnic heritage can only do more harm than good. Treating ethnic-minority people not as individuals but as representatives of ethnic groups will only undermine our multi-ethnic democracy.

&amp;gt; Beyond the identitarian game-playing, Britain is grappling with myriad social and economic problems. From the cost-of-living crisis to the endless backlogs in the NHS, the Tories have left numerous open goals for the opposition. The classic conservative message, that family stability and hard work can insulate people from harsh economic conditions, sounds tin-eared at best amid the current crises. These are the bread-and-butter domestic issues that Tory leadership candidates should be challenged on. But instead, the Conservatives’ opponents have been reduced to race-baiting playground behaviour.

Tomiwa Owolade writes for the New Statesman [It’s absurd to say the Conservative Party isn’t ready for a non-white leader](https://www.newstatesman.com/quickfire/2022/07/its-absurd-to-say-the-conservative-party-isnt-ready-for-a-non-white-leader)

&amp;gt; But the third and most pressing point is this: why shouldn’t an ethnic minority person be a Conservative? If we accept that not all ethnic minority people are the same – which should be the first plank of anti-racism – then we have to accept that they do not all share the same political perspective. And nor should they. Political pluralism should be staunchly defended: it is as important an element of diversity as any other.

--------------------

I&#39;d sum up the whole debate like this:

* The left know the Tories are doing better than Labour on diversity at the top so they&#39;re keeping quiet.
* The right don&#39;t care that much, and are mostly talking about taxes and cost of living. (Except Kemi Badenoch whose mostly talking about free speech and culture) But are willing to take a bit of a victory lap to indulge themselves. 
* While everyone writing about this topic is by definition engaging in culture wars. I think you can say that people who mention the fox are more tribal than people who don&#39;t.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifu5vwr/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/iftth4n/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] What does it mean for someone to &#34;find themselves&#34;?

I see this phrase used all the time in contexts that seem almost oppposite.

Joe is a 27 year old dentist, highly successful, but got into dentistry because his parents wanted him to. He decides to take a 6 month holiday in south america to &#34;find himself&#34;, hiking, partying and travelling, and comes back refreshed and ready to grind dentistry for another 5 years.

Sam is a 25 year old loser stereotype. Lives with his parents playing world of warcraft while working 30 hours a week as assistant manager at the local burger king. Started a degree in computer science but never finished it. Sam decides to &#34;find himself&#34;, a process which involves joining a gym, taking steroids, and getting into bodybuilder culture. He later competes as an amateur bodybuilder and starts an instagram, and appears to have higher self esteem, though the excessive focus on bodybuilding and steroids seems slightly unsavoury. His newfound lifestyle at least allows him to start dating, though he still lives with his mum and has racked up a problematic credit card debt.

Anne is a practicing surgeon and has a high pressure full time job. Anne decides to take on higher paying contract work for 12 months, which is similarly high pressured, which she describes as &#34;finding herself&#34;.

So finding yourself sort of seems like reevaluating your priorities in life, possibly changing them, possibly keeping them the same but with a firmer grasp on the underlying reasons, possibly changing your behaviours slightly but leaving your personality largely unchanged with slightly more money or sex partners, possibly focusing on short term financial goals to defer more profound goals until later.

I sort of see threads of commonality, but it also feels functionally like a just-so story for any set of behaviours whatsoever. Self improvement? Find yourself. 6 month holiday? Find yourself. Divorce and start dating fresh? Find yourself. Take on higher paying contract role? Find yourself.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/iftth4n/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/iftd8wr/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] [Noah Smith on how Shinzo Abe is not the man the West paints him to be.](https:/</title><updated>2022-07-12T03:56:00Z</updated><author><name>CD-ROM_INSTRUCTOR</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">[Noah Smith on how Shinzo Abe is not the man the West paints him to be.](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/abe-shinzo-a-retrospective) Some excerpts:

**Economic Policy**

&amp;gt;But most important of all was the shift in the economic role of women. Before Abe, Japan had persistently lagged in terms of women’s labor force participation, especially among mothers. The country’s sexism was legendary and entrenched. When Abe came to power at the end of 2012, I definitely did not expect him to change this — during his brief, abortive first tenure as PM, his health minister caused a national scandal by referring to women as “birth-giving machines”. Abe’s reputation as a staunch cultural conservative seemed to presage more business-as-usual.  
But it was not business-as-usual. As soon as he got into office for the second time, Abe began to talk up the importance of women in the workforce, and to implement some real policies toward this end as well. By 2014, it was clear to me that the national dialogue around the issue had shifted.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The key number we were all keeping an eye on here was women’s labor force participation, which surpassed the number for the United States for the first time in 2017.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;So on macroeconomic policy and structural reform, Abe really delivered in a way that I didn’t expect him to. And the results were clear — falling unemployment despite a flood of new workers into the labor force, record profits for small and medium sized businesses, and modestly rising incomes despite rapid aging and a growth in the old-age dependency ratio.

**Surprisingly Liberal**

&amp;gt;But by the second time Abe took power, his approach had changed. Abe visited Yasukuni Shrine — where the ashes of several Japanese war criminals are kept — once at the beginning of his term in office, but did not do so afterwards. This was in contrast to his mentor Koizumi Junichiro, who had made annual visits when he was Prime Minister in the 2000s. That was the first hint that Abe was behaving in a less overtly nationalist manner in his second term.  
In 2015, Abe reversed his previous denialist stance on the issue of Korean “comfort women” (WW2-era sex slaves), issuing a formal apology and explicitly laying the blame on the Japanese military for the first time.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;But Abe’s most liberal actions came in an area that’s not (yet) a hot-button issue in Japan — immigration. Under Abe, Japan opened itself up to immigration in a way that it never has before, with a “guest worker” program that offered a path to permanent residence, and a fast-track permanent residency program for skilled workers. The number of foreigners living and working and settling down in Japan soared.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The anti-racist wave that beat back the racists online was present in the real world too — anti-racist counter-protesters showed up to shout down the hateful Zaitokukai, usually outnumbering them by a huge margin. Of course, Abe doesn’t get credit for that activism, but unlike Donald Trump — who spent a lot of time attacking “antifa” and ran cover for racist demonstrators — Abe and his administration focused on cracking down on the racists. That kind of leadership makes a difference.  
On almost every issue of race and nationhood, therefore, Abe — in his second term — behaved as the polar opposite of Donald Trump. He opened up his country to immigration, tourism, and trade, apologized for past misdeeds, made overtures to old enemies, and cracked down on racism.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/iftd8wr/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ift23ku/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] I&#39;m rewatching Kizumonogatari.

[Core curriculum](https://pastebin.com/56ftUTbw)
===

(I&#39;ve translated it and dumped onto pastebin); some excerpts below:

Objectives

&amp;gt; 1. In the aspect of attitude to the truth: the acquisition of reliable knowledge of the most important cultural, political, social and economic changes in Poland and the world after 1945 up to the present - and in this context obtaining an understanding of the main issues of social life, politics and law, as well as knowledge of the immediate origins and nature of the great problems of the modern world.
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt; 2. in the aspect of attitude towards the good: to prepare the student for an independent and fair assessment of the said changes taking place in Poland and in the world since the end of World War II in terms of continuity and change (or rupture) in relation to the foundations from which our Homeland grows, understood as a community shaped according to specific cultural norms and visions of man, family and society dating back to the classical Greco-Roman civilization and Christianity.
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt; 3. in the aspect of attitude to life: acquiring an inquisitive interest in collective life, readiness to personally undertake social tasks and civic involvement in the spirit of patriotism as a wise love of the homeland formed in the tradition of the Republic, through the practice of individual and social virtues, as well as through the discovery of the harmony of rights and duties, freedom and responsibility, human happiness and the development of human communities, and the importance of just laws and prudent policies.

Some specific requirements

&amp;gt; III. The world and Poland from 1956 to 1970. Student:
==
&amp;gt; 8) characterizes the principles of the social market economy and the &#34;welfare state&#34;, presents examples of them in relation to the world of the early 1960s;
&amp;gt;

&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 17) characterizes the ways of struggle of the regime of the Polish People&#39;s Republic against the Church in the 60s and 70s (including the relegation of religious people to the status of second-class citizens);
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 18) is able to apply his knowledge of various models of relations between religious associations and the state to explain **the communist policy of &#34;separation of church and state&#34;; explains the terms: secularism, secularism, indifferentism;**
&amp;gt;

==
&amp;gt; 1) characterizes the reasons for the weakening of the position of the United States of America in the world in the early 1970s and the growth of the influence of the global communist camp (defeat in Vietnam, the Watergate affair, the energy crisis);
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 7) characterizes the way in which Germany settles its accounts with the legacy of Nazi rule (positive and negative examples: the activities of the Center for the Prosecution of Nazi Crimes in Ludwigsburg, the career of Heinz Reinefarth, the issue of reparations and restitution of the works of art seized in Poland);
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 9) characterizes the rule of Edward Gierek (prosperity on credit, submission to the USSR, changes in the Constitution of the People&#39;s Republic of Poland in 1976);
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 10) characterizes the main manifestations of the opposition in Poland in the 1970s: The Catholic Church and the birth of the so-called democratic opposition after the 1976 workers&#39; protests;

&amp;gt; V. The world and Poland in 1980-1991 The student:
==
&amp;gt; 1) characterizes the changes in the programs of Western left and right-wing parties evident in the 1970s and 1980s, and the rise in popularity of free-market and conservative-liberal programs (&#34;new right,&#34; neoliberalism);
&amp;gt;

The left and the right have both recently used this slogan, and interestingly enough, have argued their points in almost exactly the same way down four levels of argument.

**Abortion**

- Left: When it comes to abortion, my body my choice. The government must respect my bodily autonomy and my right to make choices about my own body.
- Right: But it’s not just about your body. There is a child developing inside of you who also has rights, and the government must respect their bodily autonomy too.
- Left: It&#39;s not a real child, it doesn’t substantially have the ability to experience or think. Even ignoring my right to privacy, I have the right to avoid a life-changing nine month pregnancy which could see me dead or disabled because of it, and I would also be consenting to the onerous duty of having to raise and support the child for at least eighteen years, and in the case of an otherwise healthy child with Down Syndrome, in perpetuity.
- Right: Well, how about adoption instead?

**Vaccine**

- Right: When it comes to the vaccine, my body my choice. The government must respect my bodily autonomy and my right to make choices about my own body.
- Left: But it’s not just about your body. There is a community of people breathing around you who also have rights, and the government must respect their bodily autonomy too.
- Right: It&#39;s not a real vaccine, it doesn’t substantially prevent transmission. Even ignoring my right to privacy, I have the right to avoid a life-changing shot which could see me dead or disabled because of it, and I would be consenting to the onerous duty of having to show the government and private companies my vaccine cards with all required boosters in perpetuity.
- Left: Well, how about lockdowns instead?

EDIT: Well, it looks like I found a nigh-perfect [scissor statement](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/). Although I have opinions on both topics, I was inspired to post this simply by how closely the arguments are mirrored.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifqh42h/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifqfwcp/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] I would appreciate if someone could provide feedback on this line of thinking.

It&#39;s something that occurred to me during a long evening walk and I can&#39;t decide whether this is a somewhat accurate map of the territory or a complete fabrication of some baser part of my mind.

Collectivism as a different mode of being. I had always assumed that people who lean toward it do so through a conscious choice, that they think through some sort of mini social contract, judge the benefits, and accept/reject it on merit before joining a group. Also, they&#39;re conscious and watchful while part of some group so that if the group breaks the contract, they would leave it.

But what if it&#39;s not a conscious choice? What if, whoever dips their head under the collectivist waterline, surrenders their &#34;self&#34; and their brain becomes a substrate for running the collective&#39;s distributed OS?

Perhaps it will help if I describe what lead me to this train of thought. I imagined a person deeply enmeshed in some collective identity. If you&#39;re in the US, imagine a woman with short blue hair, her face full of piercings, a t-shirt that says &#34;long live Che&#34;, a pair of Doc Marten&#39;s, and NPR blaring on her headphones. Or, to balance things out, imagine an obese man driving a leased pickup truck with one American and one Gadsden flag, listening to a radio version of One America Network&#39;s report about election fraud.

What these two stereotype images have in common is that it seems both of these people have surrendered their minds to a collective. In other words, they outsource their opinion-formation and worldview out to a group of people. Do they still reason? Are they critical of new information? Do they introspect? Or do they merely think what their chosen collective tells them to think?

I&#39;ve met many people that fall somewhere farther or closer to these stereotypes. And one characteristic that always strikes me is that they communicate in the same way: repeating slogans or headlines from their preferred media source (or social media milieu), ie. they&#39;re outputting canned rhetoric someone cooked up for them. Because of that, they can&#39;t actually engage in a discussion because they can&#39;t respond to arguments. They can only shoot back these prepackaged messages.

Going down this slippery slope, talking with people like this doesn&#39;t mean engaging with a reasoning individual, but with a tentacle of a much larger organism. Basically, an alien.

Eh, I know that to some this must sound like an edgy 16 yo&#39;s, &#34;2deep4you&#34; line of thinking. I think I bring it up because it&#39;s dawning on me just how differently different people think and it&#39;s freaking me out. I think one of my core beliefs was that people reason more or less in the same way, but observing people is shaking things up in my mind.

So, is there any merit to this? Any threads in the form of reading I could pull to understand this side of humanity better? Any gross mistakes in this view?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifqfwcp/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifpphsh/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] We talked quite a bit about the quality of information in the media ecosystem an</title><updated>2022-07-11T12:20:02Z</updated><author><name>Walterodim79</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">We talked quite a bit about the quality of information in the media ecosystem and how that has intersected with science of questionable quality in the Covid universe, but today I want to highlight an example that&#39;s generally a bit further from the culture war. Over the weekend, my NYT digest pinged me with the now one year old wellness article *[Do We Really Need to Take 10,000 Steps a Day for Our Health?](https://archive.ph/Xq0Fv#selection-319.0-322.0)*. As someone that&#39;s immediately triggered by people looking for excuses to justify their sedentary lifestyles, I naturally clicked through for a quick rage-read (put aside for a moment how unhealthy *that* behavior is). So, what&#39;s the origin of the claim that fewer steps is actually fine?

&amp;gt;A 2019 study by Dr. Lee and her colleagues found that women in their 70s who managed as few as 4,400 steps a day reduced their risk of premature death by about 40 percent, compared to women completing 2,700 or fewer steps a day. The risks for early death continued to drop among the women walking more than 5,000 steps a day, but benefits plateaued at about 7,500 daily steps. In other words, older women who completed fewer than half of the mythic 10,000 daily steps tended to live substantially longer than those who covered even less ground.

Wait, *what*? How does this causal inference chain work? If you showed me [that study](https://archive.ph/3Xcuo), I&#39;d think it&#39;s fine as far as it goes, but that the only thing that it really tells us is that elderly women that have dropped to as few as 2,700 steps are often pretty well on death&#39;s door, which is what I would have already expected. There&#39;s pretty much nothing I can draw from that regarding the value of moving more for young and middle-aged people. There definitely isn&#39;t anything strong enough to move me off the prior that moving more is almost always a good thing. I suppose I agree that there&#39;s no magic number and if there was, it&#39;d be a hell of a coincidence that it happened to line up with a shiny, round number, but that&#39;s never really been the point anyway. Oh well though, she&#39;s not done citing evidence:

&amp;gt;Another, more expansive study last year of almost 5,000 middle-aged men and women of various ethnicities likewise found that 10,000 steps a day are not a requirement for longevity. In that study, people who walked for about 8,000 steps a day were half as likely to die prematurely from heart disease or any other cause as those who accumulated 4,000 steps a day. The statistical benefits of additional steps were slight, meaning it did not hurt people to amass more daily steps, up to and beyond the 10,000-steps mark. But the extra steps did not provide much additional protection against dying young, either.

Well, that&#39;s a bit more encouraging, so [what does that study say](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2763292)? 

&amp;gt;A total of 4840 participants (mean age, 56.8 years; 2435 [54%] women; 1732 [36%] individuals with obesity) wore accelerometers for a mean of 5.7 days for a mean of 14.4 hours per day. The mean number of steps per day was 9124. There were 1165 deaths over a mean 10.1 years of follow-up, including 406 CVD and 283 cancer deaths. The unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality was 76.7 per 1000 person-years (419 deaths) for the 655 individuals who took less than 4000 steps per day; 21.4 per 1000 person-years (488 deaths) for the 1727 individuals who took 4000 to 7999 steps per day; 6.9 per 1000 person-years (176 deaths) for the 1539 individuals who took 8000 to 11 999 steps per day; and 4.8 per 1000 person-years (82 deaths) for the 919 individuals who took at least 12 000 steps per day. Compared with taking 4000 steps per day, taking 8000 steps per day was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.44-0.55]), as was taking 12 000 steps per day (HR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.28-0.45]). Unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality by peak 30 cadence was 32.9 per 1000 person-years (406 deaths) for the 1080 individuals who took 18.5 to 56.0 steps per minute; 12.6 per 1000 person-years (207 deaths) for the 1153 individuals who took 56.1 to 69.2 steps per minute; 6.8 per 1000 person-years (124 deaths) for the 1074 individuals who took 69.3 to 82.8 steps per minute; and 5.3 per 1000 person-years (108 deaths) for the 1037 individuals who took 82.9 to 149.5 steps per minute. Greater step intensity was not significantly associated with lower mortality after adjustment for total steps per day (eg, highest vs lowest quartile of peak 30 cadence: HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.65-1.27]; P value for trend = .34).

OK, this is actually pretty good. It&#39;s still more in the direction of predictive data than advice (IMO), but those differences are *really* large. We should be looking at that and describing dropping to 4,000 steps per day in middle age as an emergency, a strong predictor of impending doom. This doesn&#39;t necessarily provide advice for the young, but we can probably start drawing some inferences about just how bad it is to not move around much. Of note, the 12,000 step group actually did a decent bit better than the 8,000 step group; they have overlapping confidence intervals, so that&#39;s a weak conclusion, but I&#39;d personally be inclined to take it as a suggestion that we don&#39;t really have any cap on the &#34;more is better&#34; line of thinking. What&#39;s the conclusion from our intrepid NYT reporter?

&amp;gt;The good news is that upping our current step counts by even a few thousand additional strides most days could be a reasonable, sufficient — and achievable — goal, Dr. Lee said. The formal physical activity guidelines issued by the United States and other governments use time, not steps, as a recommendation, and suggest we exercise for at least 150 minutes a week, or a half-hour most days, in addition to any moving around we do as part of our normal, daily lives. Translated into step counts, Dr. Lee said, that total would work out to a little more than 16,000 steps a week of exercise for most people, or about 2,000 to 3,000 steps most days. (Two thousand steps equal approximately a mile.) If, like many people, we currently take about 5,000 steps a day during the course of everyday activities like shopping and housework, adding the extra 2,000 to 3,000 steps would take us to a total of between 7,000 and 8,000 steps most days, which, Dr. Lee said, seems to be the step-count sweet spot.

Wait, *what*? How is that the &#34;sweet spot&#34;? Is this based on the idea that it&#39;s some unbearable suffering to go for a long walk? I&#39;m just absolutely blown away that anyone would treat 10,000 steps as (implied above) unreasonable and unachievable. Just how low of a bar are we setting and why is that the tone that a NYT blogger wants to set for people?

On one level, I know I&#39;m being petty, but I actually do think misunderstanding causality and failing to actually look at the data in a couple pretty simple papers highlights just how bad science and medical journalism is. It&#39;s not just politically charged topics like Covid and environmentalism, it&#39;s something as simple as, &#34;should people be advised to take more than 8,000 steps?&#34;. When the writing is this bad on something that I wouldn&#39;t expect bias to creep in, I find that I&#39;m unsurprised that it goes completely off the rails on topics where there&#39;s a tribal affiliation with morally good conclusions.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifpphsh/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifp0lwd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] According to [this graph ](https://nitter.net/QuarantinedCoof/status/15461851456</title><updated>2022-07-11T07:01:36Z</updated><author><name>RadicalizeMeCaptain</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">According to [this graph ](https://nitter.net/QuarantinedCoof/status/1546185145698353154#m), Biden&#39;s approval rating took a big dip after the Afghanistan pullout.

Week 2/60 is behind me. Not much to report. Water fasted Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and today. 2 more weeks until I begin resistance training and trying to put on muscle. Shedding fat at a crazy rate but perceptibly losing muscle mass as well as to be expected. I can notice a tiny bit of loose skin around my abdomen in dim lighting but not as bad as I feared. No clue whether fasting is helping on that front but still seems worthwhile since I am leaning out so fast. Am extremely eager to hit the weights in a few weeks. I will post before once I am done dieting in a few weeks.

Current plan is to fast Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday next week. Then Monday, Tuesday, eat maintenance on Wednesday and then conclude with a 4-day fast to complete my leaning out phase. After that I will slowly reintroduce calories until I get to a calculated maintenance for a week or two and then lift at a small caloric surplus. 

Will report back next week.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifofoo2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifnth1f/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] What happens to thinking people who are clearly wrong but [whose heads haven&#39;t e</title><updated>2022-07-11T00:16:45Z</updated><author><name>Ilforte</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">What happens to thinking people who are clearly wrong but [whose heads haven&#39;t exploded](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_dennett_the_illusion_of_consciousness?language=en)? 

The (imo) stupid adage that science advances one funeral at a time is so old that I think it has finally [overstayed its welcome](https://rootsofprogress.org/how-curing-aging-could-help-progress) and, with any luck, we&#39;ll bid it final goodbyes soon enough. 

Yes sometimes, often even, it is right on the money. There are walking scholarly zombies all around: people who&#39;ve bet it all on a hypothesis, have been publicly and convincingly proven wrong (or had the ground move under them to the point their entire map became obsolete) and have not recanted. Indeed, some double down or just begin to ignore all criticism. 

What do we know about such cases and such people? Are they just cognitively rigid and emotionally invested? Bound like slaves to a cottage factory that has been built around their assumptions, perhaps? Does the stress of debunking alter their reasoning somehow, degrade it maybe? How does it feel from the inside? I&#39;ve seen some curious patterns, but don&#39;t want to bias you.

I was reading about that [Russian fox experiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox). Domesticated traits started to occur only after the second generation. After six generations you had a few hyper-domesticated foxes and by the 20th generation 30% of foxes constituted this hyper-domesticated status. 

The Christian social system appears especially conducive to domestication.  Only those with especially prosocial tendencies will get the most out of services; those with especially “domesticated” qualities will be graded best by peers according to the Christian rubric of grading another’s behavior; greater voluntary activity within the church would draw in the especially prosocial, creating prosocial pairings similar to in the Fox experiment. Those who best internalized the behavioral proscriptions of the Church had the highest status, and this obedience is a kind of domestication. Traits like intelligence, humor, and athleticism have no real value in the historically Christian social system, although a minimum amount of intelligence was probably necessary to secure a mate.

Compare to what (little) we know about Paganism. Paganism had no such fixation on domesticated qualities.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/iflb2gs/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifkz35p/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] So a few months ago, I stumbled upon the [Healthy Gamer Youtube channel](https:/</title><updated>2022-07-10T10:51:07Z</updated><author><name>cae_jones</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">So a few months ago, I stumbled upon the [Healthy Gamer Youtube channel](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UClHVl2N3jPEbkNJVx-ItQIQ), and found some of the suggestions there helpful as regards creative projects.

I managed to get sufficiently into the habit of working on it at certain times that not working on it is unpleasant, but I&#39;m having trouble getting myself to either work on the unnecessary-for-me-but-should-probably-do-anyway bits, or starting something different, and so I feel at risk of backsliding into the abyss.

They’ve always hated that I cut the sibling off and have continually pressured me to reconnect for years. The estrangement has gone on since 2010.

The sibling was physically abusive toward me, as well as very emotionally abusive. I have other siblings and they maintain a relationship with this one. When the estranged sibling comes up in conversation with the other siblings, it is almost always complaints about their abusive behavior. Which leads me to believe I made the right decision for my own sanity, and that the behavior that precipitated the estrangement is ongoing. 

This situation with our parent has led the abusive sibling to reach out to me, but the thought of talking to them or even being in the same room as them gives me a great deal of anxiety. I did not respond. 

But I’m getting even more pressure than usual - parent is dying. My estrangement of the sibling is “killing” them. Why can’t I just let bygones be bygones. 

They won’t listen to me when I describe being abused by this sibling, or when I point out the hypocrisy that the dying parent didn’t talk to their siblings for decades because of shitty behavior. They have a history of ignoring abuse, like with another family member who is an accused child molester (I have personal experience that this accusation is 100% true) and is still invited to gatherings. 

I guess I just don’t know how to navigate this. I live in a different state, visiting theirs, and I am trying to spend time with my dying parent but every time we talk, it’s brought up how I need to put aside my differences with the sibling and make amends. 

It makes me doubt my own experiences and makes me feel intense guilt. Part of me wants to placate them. Part of me wants to go home and never contact my parents again. How would you deal with this.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifkeby3/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifjq0i7/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Does the opposite of the Gambler&#39;s Fallacy have merit?

The tldr on the Gambler&#39;s Fallacy is this &#34;We&#39;re flipping a coin. It hit heads the last 4 times, so we&#39;re due a tails this next time.&#34; But, the law of independent variables tells us that&#39;s BS. Each flip is independent, and so the odds of hitting tails doesn&#39;t go up each time you hit heads.

But, does the odds of a heads *increase* for each heads previously flipped?

I want to argue yes, and yeah, I&#39;m aware of the Hot Hand Fallacy. But here&#39;s my idea...

After some improbable number of consecutive heads flipping (and this is important) *the same coin*, the odds that the coin isn&#39;t fair increases. Cheating starts to become a better explanation than just chance.

And this becomes apparent at the extreme. Imagine a coin has been flipped 1 million times, heads all 1 million of them. Then we flip a million and oneth time. What are the odds of heads? It&#39;s not 50/50, because the 1 million previous flips are basically proof positive that the coin is rigged.

If that last million-flip example makes sense, I&#39;d wonder where is the number of flips where we start to think there&#39;s a meaningful deviation from the 50/50 prediction.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifjq0i7/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifj0415/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] to those who have done deep dives into metaphysics/ontology/epistemology: is it </title><updated>2022-07-09T22:33:40Z</updated><author><name>SebJenSeb</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">to those who have done deep dives into metaphysics/ontology/epistemology: is it worth it? to me most of these arguments are a great example of philosophical masturbation about things that dont mean anything in the real word.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifj0415/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifiszzt/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] So a Nazi walks into a bar.

Yesterday night I was at a party (purely social, alcohol and some other substances involved) in Oakland with some friends and got a bit bored, so I asked someone what their most controversial opinion was. Their response was that... they thought Trump was a criminal and should be in prison, an opinion that was well-received by the group. Which left me in a bit of a pickle when the question turned around to me. So I chickened out and offered something off the wall about non-practicing pedophiles being condemned too harshly by society. Which was a bit spicier, but it was carefully constructed not to be relevant to any hot button issues that would actually be controversial. (Yes, it&#39;s pretty crazy that I felt like a NAMBLA-adjacent opinion is less controversial than saying something like &#34;school shootings aren&#39;t a major issue in our society&#34; or &#34;1/6 wasn&#39;t really important or a threat to our democracy,&#34; but there we are.)

But it got me to thinking: where can I find real-life friends or social settings where there&#39;s actual space for debate and discussion? Luckily my girlfriend is pretty open-minded, but (at least among the friends I&#39;ve made, mostly professionals in the Bay Area) it seems hard to find social spaces that are open to discussion to contentious topics without them devolving into insults or attribution of bad motives to someone.

Or am I just being overly neurotic here? Maybe I should have just stated something actually controversial instead of hoping someone else would, since I brought it up in the first place? In retrospect it was probably unfair for me to ask someone else to go out on a limb when I was too scared to myself...</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifih61c/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/iffvcby/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] [She works in cryonics now](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/ageless).

(set cca 2600 or so)

&amp;gt;I was thinking about how free of mobs recent centuries had been: **to create a mob there must be public meetings,** and public meetings in our time consisted of individuals communing via the All Thing or other datasphere channels; it is hard to create mob passion when people are separated by kilometers and light-years, connected only by comm lines and fatline threads.

Indeed, it seems  that networking supercharges mobs, and the networked ones are even worse than the physical  ones.

It’s a fairly large and active community of Christian polygamists. They’re not associated with a denomination (definitely not Mormon) and seems to be legitimate biblical scholars. They have reasoned their way into polygamy with carful reading of scripture. If you liked watching Big Love and want to really see how modern polygamists live. Here’s your shot. 

Some observations:

* They seems to be quite persecuted within mainstream Christiandom. As you would expect.
* They also seem to be quite intelligent and know the Bible inside and out. They can support their position quite well and it seems difficult find a flaw in their logic. As a Catholic, I can’t say that I’m an expert on scripture and the only argument I have against their logic is that The Church has taken a very diffierent view on sex and marriage. Without having The Church as an authority, I don’t know how evangelicals who stick to the Bible as ultimate authority can pin these people down. 
* There does seem to be some motivated reasoning going on here. Some posters are clearly looking to justify their lust and build a harem, but most seem to be quite sincere. 
* The community is surprisingly healthy with lots of activity and very collegial users. Reminds me of themotte in some ways. 

I find the whole thing fascinating. Besides the whole intellectual discussion of polygamy and the Bible there are quite of few gems in here. Ever want to see a bunch of Christian men painstakingly discuss whether or not lesbiansism between sister wives is a sin (spoiler: it’s not)? Ever want to see full throated defense and encorgament of patriarchy? I’ve always loved to observe these types of communities that I would otherwise not know about. Reminds me of early internet days. 

I won’t link to the the forum, but you can google christian polygamy forum and find it quite easily.

I&#39;m 23, male, white, just finished a master&#39;s degree, starting a career in software engineering, normal-looking (though skinny; I&#39;m working on that), and shy in large groups of new people (but alright one on one). The main problem is that I&#39;m gay in a moderate-size city in the US South, population 150,000, whose main university was recently ranked the least LGBT-friendly public university in the nation.

Due to general awkwardness and being busy during college and grad school, I&#39;ve never kissed a guy or been on a date, but girls have definitely liked me, so I think I would do alright if I could just meet some gay guys that are at least slightly nerdy. My question is then how to do that.

There are gay bars in town, but bars aren&#39;t at all my scene, I personally don&#39;t drink for genetic reasons, I&#39;m not looking for a hookup (I could just use Grindr if I was), and it just seems like my kind of guy is unlikely to be at a bar. But maybe I should try anyway?

I tried Tinder and Bumble, but the pools are so small (I exhausted them in just a couple hours) and a large proportion of guys smoke (a deal-breaker for me) or are just looking for a hookup. I got a couple matches, but they almost immediately stopped responding, which I suppose is to be expected on the apps.

To make some regular friends in town, I&#39;ve started going to a board game club. There used to be a pretty active programmers community in town, which apparently kind of collapsed during the pandemic, but I&#39;ll keep an eye on it. For some physical activity I&#39;m thinking about joining a recreational soccer league this fall.

Thoughts on any of this would be appreciated, thanks!</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if3qh70/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if3dicu/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Has anyone managed to reverse their myopia?

&amp;gt;This is a method that says that some specific poor vision habits plus slightly-too-powerful glasses induce myopia, and that some other specific good vision habits plus different glasses can reverse it.

&amp;gt; In various corners of the internet there is an overwhelming abundance of anecdotal claims from people who aren&#39;t sockpuppets (I checked) that the model&#39;s interventions are effective. This is what led me to try it. A lot of the information here is based on a synthesis of the perspectives provided by people in various communities attempting this process.

https://www.losetheglasses.org/

The key idea seems to be not to over-correct your vision for your current task. If you are looking at a computer for 8 hours a day, do not wear your full strength distance glasses, but a weaker pair that are just strong enough to see the screen.

This sounds plausible and fairly cheap to try.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if3dicu/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if3cld0/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Woke up at midnight, puked, had to shower to get cleaned up, restless sleep off </title><updated>2022-07-06T16:32:52Z</updated><author><name>bl1y</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">Woke up at midnight, puked, had to shower to get cleaned up, restless sleep off and on, 101 fever.

Really neat article about the way pain functions. Situated a lot of things into context for me. 

Does anyone have reading recommendation talking about the way our brains act in moments of acute stress, from a somewhat larger angle?

I hate exercising. It brings me no pleasure whatsoever. I would, however, like to have as much high quality time with my wife and kids as possible. My current cardio routine consists of running a 5k on a treadmill twice a week (typical time \~23:30-24 minutes) and a 5-mile outdoor run perhaps once every 3-4 weeks (typical time \~40-42 minutes). Is there any incremental utility in running more or could I be happy just maintaining this?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if2s33v/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if2o0jm/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] I say many word, when few word do trick.

It&#39;s a fun thing to organize my strength training around, and the incredibly technical nature of the snatch/clean-and-jerk would probably appeal to a lot of y&#39;all. So many layers to dig into with these two moves. 

It&#39;s a great sport because it requires strength, balance, flexibility and a Motte-level obsession with analysis and details.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if2h0sf/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if1ptbl/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] I&#39;m able to get 2 hours of work done every other day and work out twice a week a</title><updated>2022-07-06T07:20:30Z</updated><author><name>practical_romantic</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">I&#39;m able to get 2 hours of work done every other day and work out twice a week as the gym is 45 minutes away.

Not great progress but programming is quite fun although taxing. My aim for this week is to workout 3 days a week and work 4-6 hours daily while ensuring I get plenty of sleep at the right time.

It&#39;s genuinely bad but still honest progress and with achievable goals.

Here&#39;s also a text exchange between me and a friend of mine that describes an event which will be the last part of my post. 

So I met my classmate who got into IIT Kanpur today for breakfast
He was here with two other dudes from his uni, one was from CS and the other from materials.
My classmate and the CS dude hadn&#39;t taken a year off like I had and they went from being wierdo nerds who were prentious to well adjusted people who&#39;d indulge in hedonism and doing well in life.
Good to get periodical reminders like today.
I don&#39;t have any girls I text for now and will keep it that way.
You&#39;re right about time man.
I can have all the fun in the world but for now, back to work.

IIT Kanpur is the best uni in the country and is above the one I go to. Both these people have gotten selected by different grad schools (UIUC and CMU respectively) with a bare minium research profile since the recommendation of faculty there matters a lot. 

My point is that there&#39;s a time and place to have fun and there&#39;s a time and place to just study, my current situation is the latter. 

I was genuinely surprised when I was able to solve programming questions and got a sense of joy doing that so shall continue. Working out is a tad hectic and people mock me for even trying since I&#39;ve been doing it on and off for the past year but would go for a week and not go again for a month due to the pajeet exam schedule. 

Anyway, have a fun week ahead.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if1ptbl/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
