I&#39;ve been thinking about how the discussion about AI art can be linked back to the culture war, since that is our *raison d&#39;être*.

Most of the discussion here has focused on the object-level issues concerning AI art: the economic impact to artists, the projected rate of progression of the technology, etc.  What I&#39;m interested in here, though, is the psychological profiles of the participants in the debate.  It&#39;s clear to me that there are people who *like AI*, and there are people who *don&#39;t like AI*.  That is, regardless of your object-level beliefs about the inevitability of the development of the technology, or how many jobs it will displace, or what potential benefits it may bring to society and culture at large, people tend to enter the debate with a preexisting positive or negative emotional affect towards the concept of AI itself.  Some people are happy that the technology exists; some are not.

What causes someone to join one group or the other?  What sorts of underlying beliefs and values are at play here?  What patterns can we observe?

To make things clear up front, I *don&#39;t like* AI, and I especially don&#39;t like AI art, so part of the analysis will inevitably take place from that point of view, although I ultimately hope to touch on the underlying psychological motivations of both groups.

Let&#39;s dispose of some of the simple and obvious explanations first: the idea, for example, that the only people worried about AI art are artists who are afraid of losing their jobs, and any other sane person should be happy to reap the rewards of increasingly democratized access to the means of cultural production.  I can&#39;t object to this idea from an *entirely* neutral point of view, since drawing and painting are more tied to my identity than they are for the average person, but I can still object to it from a semi-objective point of view.  I have no musical ability whatsoever, nor do I have any interest in ever developing any, but I still don&#39;t like AI music.  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s been years at this point since I first heard about AI composing pieces in the style of Bach and Beethoven, and I didn&#39;t like that stuff when I first heard about it either.  It rubs me the wrong way.

Nor can opposition to AI be reduced to simple technological luddism, or a knee-jerk preference for what is familiar over what is new and unfamiliar.  I am not opposed to all technological progress on principle - I welcome the advent of interstellar travel, and the curing of diseases like cancer and ALS.  Conversely, I am skeptical of technologies that have been a familiar part of my life since childhood.  I can hardly remember a time when I didn&#39;t have access to the internet, and yet my feelings towards it are mixed at best.  It&#39;s a double edged sword - it has brought many great things, but also many terrible things.  If I could somehow freeze publicly-available internet access at a level of development comparable to the late 90s, I probably would.  But that&#39;s another story.

It&#39;s not hard to enumerate factors that I *incidentally* find distasteful about AI art - that it will flood the world with a glut of low-effort content, that it will inflate the egos of people who think they are &#34;artists&#34; when they are in fact nothing of the sort, that it will discourage people from developing genuine creativity because it will be easier to settle for a half-hearted, inauthentic substitute - but I think that none of these considerations truly strike at the heart of the issue for me.  My intuition is that there is something deeper going on, something that can be related to the culture war, because I think I can see familiar patterns from the culture war repeating themselves.

My highly speculative thesis is that people who like AI are motivated by an *aesthetics of success*, and people who don&#39;t like AI are motivated by an *aesthetics of failure*, or a tragic aesthetics.  These positions also correspond in a very loose way to the left/right divide, respectively.  I&#39;ll try to explain what I mean.

Traditionally, leftism since Marx was founded in a belief in utopian progress - that we could resolve social problems through willful, rational action, ultimately culminating in a terminal optimal social order that was free of contradictions, or as Marx put it, &#34;the riddle of history solved&#34;.  Now, it&#39;s possible to claim that modern (or even classic) leftism is not about this at all, and that it&#39;s actually a thinly disguised form of ethnic warfare.  That may be true.  But even so, you can&#39;t deny that this utopian impulse did exist in and continues to inform leftism, and more importantly, people who *enjoy* this vision of the future, people who find it *aesthetically* pleasing, people who hear the idea of an optimal non-contradictory social order and think &#34;hey that sounds like a good idea&#34;, tend to be drawn to leftism.

The same utopian impulse from Marxism also underlies the transhumanism of, for example, Yudkowsky&#39;s [Fun Theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K4aGvLnHvYgX9pZHS/the-fun-theory-sequence).  The idea (as far as I can tell from lightly skimming it) is that we could construct a perfect reality that satisfies every constraint we could ever wish to optimize for - it&#39;s exactly as exciting as we need, exactly as pleasant as we need, exactly as challenging as we need, and if for some reason you wish to meet a tragic end where you fail to fulfill all your goals, well hey we can arrange for that too.  It is logically perfect in every way - no one is excluded, no one could ask for more, even the people whose very wish is to be excluded from the utopia.  I think the relation between this kind of transhumanism on the one hand, and the development of AI on the other, is pretty obvious - if you enjoy, on an aesthetic level, the idea of a perfect transhumanist future, then you probably also enjoy on an aesthetic level when AI smashes through fundamental human limitations.

I am *in no way* saying that everyone who gets warm fuzzies for AI and transhumanism is a leftist.  Certainly we have many counterexamples on this forum.  Nor does every leftist like the idea of AI - there are plenty of leftist artists complaining on twitter about AI art as we speak.  But I do think that leftists and people who like AI are aligned on this general pro-utopian axis - they agree that a utopian future is fundamentally desirable, even if they disagree on implementation details, and many other contemporary political issues besides.

The key thing to understand about the other side, the opposition to this utopian ideal, is that *not everyone thinks that utopia is desirable*.  Some of us consciously reject it.  I mean this in a very deep way, as deep as you can possibly conceive.  I mean that even in the most logically perfect utopia you can imagine, one where everyone gets the exact amount of challenge and pain and tragedy that is suited to them, one where I can live in my tragic broken reality and you can live in your blissful nice one and we can somehow coexist simultaneously - *I still don&#39;t want that*.  I don&#39;t want reality to be like that.  I don&#39;t want reality to be at peace.  I want there to be failure in the very nature of things.  I want us to never reach a final state of peace, even if there is fire and brimstone built into that overarching peace.

From Zizek&#39;s &#34;Less Than Nothing&#34;:

&amp;gt;It is true that one finds in Hegel a systematic drive to cover everything, to propose an account of all phenomena in the universe in their essential structure; but this drive does not mean that Hegel strives to locate every phenomenon within a harmonious global edifice; on the contrary, the point of dialectical analysis is to demonstrate how every phenomenon, everything that happens, fails in its own way, implies a crack, antagonism, imbalance, in its very heart.  Hegel&#39;s gaze upon reality is that of a Roentgen apparatus which sees in everything that is alive the traces of its future death.

I find this to be an immensely aesthetically pleasing passage - it&#39;s how I want reality to be.  I imagine that transhumanists will not feel as warmly towards it (although this is an empirical hypothesis that is subject to refutation through counterexamples).  To you, there is beauty in triumph; problems are meant to be solved, and then quietly and safely set aside, conquered, dealt with.  You want to [resolve on the I chord](https://youtu.be/6aezSL_GvZA?t=430).  We won, you say; there&#39;s no need to go backwards now.  Man stands victorious at the summit of his knowledge.  You thought we couldn&#39;t make a machine that paints beautiful pictures?  Well, we did it.  We put the sum total of man&#39;s visual knowledge into a machine.  That&#39;s what we were able to accomplish; our triumph over this domain is total.  The beauty of our actions is measured by the strength of the gods we have slain.

To me, there is beauty in failure - no problem ever fully solved, no debate ever put to rest, no point of finality ever reached.  Not because there is an angry God who will slap us down if we exceed our station, but because *failure is built into the very nature of things*.  The moment of triumph becomes the moment of defeat, not due to any external force, but because of the necessity of its own inner movement.  Reality as a demonic house of mirrors where every moment of recognition is the moment of misrecognition, every realization comes too late that the act of will was actually the ultimate act of self-sabotage - this is reality as I *aesthetically* want it to be.  Doesn&#39;t mean it is.  But it&#39;s what I want - it&#39;s what I like.  And our likes and dislikes are awfully important when it comes to motivating our actions.

Hopefully there&#39;s something here to discuss.

&amp;gt;Out of love for mankind... I conceived it as my task to create difficulties everywhere.

I was listening to a podcast which interviewed a parent about social emotional learning in their school. She believes that it&#39;s a form of mind control. Does anyone know that much about the subject and its flaws/strengths?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikv9b16/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikutiu1/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] [Guessing C For Every Answer Is Now Enough To Pass The New York State Algebra Ex</title><updated>2022-08-18T22:16:58Z</updated><author><name>Tarnstellung</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">[Guessing C For Every Answer Is Now Enough To Pass The New York State Algebra Exam](https://medium.com/@newyorkteacher/guessing-c-for-every-answer-is-now-enough-to-pass-the-new-york-state-algebra-exam-93bac55b3e24)

&amp;gt;He wasn’t even present in my classroom for most of three marking periods. At the end of the year, he asked me how he was supposed to pass the state test.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;“No problem,” I said. “Just pick all Cs.”
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;“What?”
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;“Try it. I bet it will work.”
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;It worked.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; (...)
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;This problem has a clear solution: make the algebra exam an exam that actually tests a student’s ability to do algebra.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;Unfortunately, this solution is difficult to implement. Implementation is difficult because of all the reasons that drove NYSED off the cliffs of insanity in the first place. Look at the incentives. NYSED and local school districts have large financial incentives to graduate as many students as possible. These incentives were put in place by both federal and state legislators who meant well and were trying to encourage good public school performance (good performance == graduation, of course, in their eyes). Teachers and principals have large quality-of-life incentives to pass students. Failing students brings scrutiny, parent and student complaints, superintendent pressure, guidance counselor inquisitions, paperwork, and meeting after meeting. It’s much easier to pass everyone.

TL;DR: The criteria on an exam needed to graduate from high school in New York have been lowered to the point that it can be passed by someone who barely attended class.

I first saw this on /r/slatestarcodex. In [the comments](https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/wro3vz/guessing_c_for_every_answer_is_now_enough_to_pass), someone asked why the SAT wasn&#39;t more widely used by universities and employers, given that it is more standardized and objective. A discussion concerning this question would probably move in a &#34;culture war&#34; direction; hence, this post.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikutiu1/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wqhcx8/wellness_wednesday_for_august_17_2022/ikuljbf/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Three of my family members have gotten Lyme disease (edit: actually one case is </title><updated>2022-08-18T21:25:23Z</updated><author><name>MacaqueOfTheNorth</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">Three of my family members have gotten Lyme disease (edit: actually one case is some other tick borne illness) this summer.

&#34;It doesn&#39;t answer the people who say it&#39;s completely unfair to have not looked at the laptop in a timely way and to have shut down, you know, the NYpost&#39;s twitter account.  Like that&#39;s just a left wing conspiracy to deny the presidency to Donald Trump.  Absolutely it is, and I think it was warranted.&#34;

The podcast hosts press him on this, and he does admit that actually, yes, it is completely fine to suspend the idea of democracy simply to prevent Trump from getting the presidency, because he believes that Trump is a big enough threat that this is warranted.  The comparison he makes is to an asteroid heading for earth that will destroy all life on this planet, and that in that case you would do *anything* to stop it.

I think to anybody who has been paying attention to politics for the last two years, and especially to anybody who has spent much time looking at the 2020 election, this sort of thing won&#39;t be surprising.  My question to people who are still of the mind that the left isn&#39;t pushing us towards a less democratic society is: do you agree with what Sam is saying here?

C</title><updated>2022-08-18T14:53:34Z</updated><author><name>Stefferi</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">**Culture war in Finland: Stupidest day in Finnish politics for a long time**

CONTEXT: It&#39;s not a new thing that Finnish PM Sanna Marin, 36, has been frequently seen out and about, drinking and dancing in clubs and such. Of course it&#39;s not a new thing for Finnish politicians to use alcohol or even get into accidents and such while doing so, but this is the new era and everyone has smartphones.

Previously the [major affair was in December](https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-finlands-prime-minister-sanna-marin-apologises-for-going-clubbing-after-coronavirus-exposure-12490903), when she was out late in a Helsinki club even though she had been exposed to Covid and there were still Covid restrictions for various things; even though the restrictions didn&#39;t affect what she, specifically, was doing, it was considered improper. On these evenings she&#39;s been spotted with an entourage of local pop stars and other celebs.

Anyway, last week, she was at one of the major music festivals in Finland, Flow Festival - not the biggest, but a classic hipster festival and certainly &#34;upscale&#34; - and had pics taken [with the attending celebs](https://is.mediadelivery.fi/img/468/7089604209104a472752cf1aa503aeb2.jpg). This caused some tut-tutting about behaving immaturely during great crises in Europe and the world. Whatever.

Now it turns out that one of the members of her entourage took a [video of being a drunk party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C-djV-ptEM) with her entourage and posted it on IG - private account for 92 people, to be sure, but of course something like that&#39;s going to get out. The video started spreading yesterday, and the entirety of today has consisted on Finnish social and traditional media obsessing about the clip, specifically about the specific charges of whether her entourage uses cocaine.

Of course PM partying in an entourage that&#39;s on drugs would be scandal in other countries, too, whether they took coke personally or not, but Finland tends to currently be particularly conservative on drugs compared to other Western countries - even pot decriminalization is not really soemthing that most would be consider to be short-term achievable.

Hard drugs are, of course a whole other question. I haven&#39;t used anything stronger than pot in my life and it&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve even smoked, but my understanding is that coke has been a facet of celebrity life at some level. However, it&#39;s only recent years when it has really hit the scene in Helsinki. Usually, the hard drug of choice for Finns has been speed.

Now, none of the celebrities are actually snorting anything up their nose in the video, so what&#39;s the evidence for drug use? Well, apart from the fact that they&#39;re, ya know, smiling and having fun and so on in the video (Finns might drink alcohol, but we do it to get drunk, not to actually have fun), at some parts of the video, some of them shout &#34;Fuck it, this makes me feel good&#34; in reference to something unseen and the word that might be &#34;jauhojengi&#34; (&#34;flour gang&#34;) or something else. Also, some claim that some of the pixels in the video indeed make it look like there&#39;s coke on the table. (Others claim it&#39;s a phone.) One particular claim is even that people on the video must be on drugs since there are so few bottles or glasses seen.

&#34;Flour gang&#34; has instantly became a meme here, even though it&#39;s now unclear 1. whether &#34;flour&#34; is actually Finnish drug lingo, or whether it has ever been used to refer to powder drugs here by anyone and 2. whether the words &#34;jauhojengi&#34; are actually used - the video features people dancing to and singing washed-up pop rapper Petri Nygård&#39;s lyrics for the old hit song &#34;Selvä päivä&#34; (&#34;Sober day&#34;), which is about, as you might guess, drinking. (You can find [translated lyrics](https://lyricstranslate.com/en/selv%C3%A4-p%C3%A4iv%C3%A4-sober1-day.html) here if you really wish.) The word heard as &#34;jauho&#34; might well instead be a reference to &#34;jallu&#34;, or Jaloviina, an iconic Finnish booze brand that&#39;s 50 % brandy and 50 % vodka and features in a metric ton of local music.

Several medias took the whole &#34;flour gang&#34; thing and ran with it, probably one reason being that earlier in the week they were criticized for going too easy on Marin and her government. Now others are attacking media for pushing a theory originally spread (at least on Twitter) by conspiracy theorist accounts that have otherwise taken a pro-Russian narratie. Yes, there are even references to whole thing being a Russian disinfo campaign.

Marin has herself [had to comment on this](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-finnish-pm-sanna-marin-says-no-drugs-just-lots-of-dancing-at-wild/), saying that she is disappointed in the video leaking, that she only had mild alcoholic drinks and doesn&#39;t use drugs and that she&#39;s willing to even take a drug test (not that it would show cocaine use anyway, more than a few days having passed from the party). Of course it still might turn out one or more of the celeb entourage members have been on drugs, who knows?

All in all, it would probably be the best if the PM quit back on partying or at least chose better friends to avoid embarassing stuff leaking out (also, you know, for general security reasons), the first rule of the Flour Gang is to never talk about the Flour Gang, PMs should find better music to dance to than a local whiteboy 50 Cent and politics here can indeed be as dumb as anywhere else, especially with the social media and stuff.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikswpuv/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/iksffji/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Would it be good idea to have regular &#34;practical life advice&#34; thread like &#34;welln</title><updated>2022-08-18T12:52:05Z</updated><author><name>Eetan</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Would it be good idea to have regular &#34;practical life advice&#34; thread like &#34;wellness wendesday&#34; is for health and fitness?

Does it exist? Are there multiple types? Is it several different concepts that are conflated? Can people have different amounts of empathy? Can empathy be turned off on purpose? These are but a small sampling of the questions I&#39;ve asked myself, and I don&#39;t have answers. I don&#39;t know what empathy is, but I know 1. I have less of it than most people do, if I even have it at all and 2. a lot of people have empathy only when it&#39;s convenient. I waffle on whether people in my outgroup/people whose outgroup includes me are particularly unempathetic, or whether my cognitive bias just makes me think that they are.

I&#39;ve tried to understand this concept of empathy not because I think it&#39;s important to understand, but because the word &#34;empathy&#34; gets tossed around a lot and I&#39;d like to know how to interpret it. Maybe it&#39;s one of those words like &#34;racism&#34; or &#34;woke&#34; that has no precise definition and is, at best, a direction.

As a rule, I don&#39;t like seeing people suffer. However, when someone is suffering, I cannot say I feel their pain, because I&#39;m not them. I only know what it&#39;s like to be me and have the particular experiences that I&#39;ve had. The closest I can get to putting myself in the place of another person is thinking back to an experience I&#39;ve had that made me feel a certain way and acting as though that&#39;s exactly how my interlocutor feels. That&#39;s not empathy, but an approximation. The way people describe empathy makes it sound like a superpower, like mind reading. But people often act as though they can read minds (hence the concept of dog whistles), so maybe this is all one big LARP too?

I was lurking on r/ThePurplePill and I saw [this comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/wr2ls0/people_need_to_stop_saying_men_are_lonely_because/ikrjnql?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share&amp;amp;context=3) that approximates my feelings on humanity and the phony concept of empathy.

Sorry if this comes off as rambly. Basically, I&#39;m asking for a &#34;CMV: empathy isn&#39;t real&#34; or &#34;ELI5: What is empathy?&#34; I&#39;m not going to those subs, though, because I trust The Motte more than either of them.

I&#39;ve been interested in nutrition for a long time, and for a while I&#39;ve been circling this as probably the best approach to food long-term for health and longevity. The ethics side of it is nice too, but I&#39;m not super interested in discussing that. This is mostly an experiment to see how I feel, and how my weight and blood markers look after a while. I&#39;m trying to take a 90/10 approach, eating as plant-based as possible for all of my staple meals at home, but allowing some meat and dairy in when necessary, mostly when eating out. I haven&#39;t eaten any red meat or poultry in a few weeks, but I&#39;ve had fish here and then when out at restaurants, as well as some dairy stuff - some cheese here and there and ranch dressing.

Generally I&#39;ve been a hardcore meat-eater, so up until about 3 weeks ago, every dish was very focused around meat, and any vegetables were there as condiments or just because I felt like I &#34;should&#34; make myself eat some broccoli. It seems to me that this is an extremely common approach to food in the US. Everyone I know eats this way. Most of us have this idea that if you take away meat and dairy then you&#39;re stuck just eating salads all the time, but that&#39;s not the case at all. I&#39;ve been eating oatmeal + fruit + some agave for breakfast; a smoothie and usually some sort of leftovers for lunch; and the formula for dinner is roughly: some a carb (whole grain pasta, brown rice, quinoa, etc) with a few vegetables mixed in and some kind of sauce for flavoring. The other night I made whole grain spaghetti with homemade tomato sauce (just cook down canned diced tomatoes and throw in some garlic and spices), sautéed mushrooms, roasted asparagus, and then topped with sautéed spinach, and then I ate that for lunch yesterday and today, and it was delicious.

So it&#39;s been a big change, but I&#39;m loving it. When you&#39;re eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, there&#39;s just a lot more variation in flavor and texture going around. I&#39;m finding out that meat itself is kind of boring: it&#39;s mostly texture, salt, and fat flavor. It&#39;s all of the stuff surrounding it that makes it good. Really, meat is already losing its allure to me altogether.

I also feel less full and bloated after a meal. I&#39;ll be full because of the bulk of all the vegetables I just ate, but that goes away pretty quickly; otherwise I feel much better than I would after pounding a burger and fries.

Why am I using the term &#34;plant-based&#34; and not vegan? To me, vegan has a connotation of doing it more for ethical concerns, and plant-based has a connotation of being based more on nutrition. But that&#39;s just my own perception. A whole food plant based diet is one where you focus on eating plants that came from the ground more or less directly, maybe heating, chopping, and/or seasoning them first, but not much alteration beyond that. Ie, avoiding as many processed foods as possible - so while it&#39;s probably ok to have an Impossible Burger every now and then, it shouldn&#39;t be a staple. Folks who eat vegan for ethical reasons are probably more likely to eat processed foods like tofurkey or whatever, which isn&#39;t really any healthier than just eating meat all the time.

So the inevitable question is: _so where are you getting all of your protein?_ First of all, the whole &#34;incomplete protein&#34; thing isn&#39;t true - all plants have all amino acids. Yes, the amounts of each vary, but if you&#39;re eating a variety of plants then it&#39;s nothing to worry about. Incomplete proteins were written about in this popular vegetarian book in the 70s, and the author later realized her mistake and backed off of it, but it was too late - the idea had already been solidified in public consciousness.

Second, the actual amount of protein we need is probably majorly inflated for most people. Sure, bodybuilders might need more, but even they are probably majorly overdoing it. There&#39;s some good discussion about this in the book _Proteinaholic_ by Garth Davis.

In any case, it&#39;s pretty easy to hit solid protein numbers from eating plants, especially if you&#39;re getting lots of legumes. And protein shakes are still a thing if you need even more.

The only issue I&#39;ve had so far is that I&#39;m farting a lot, and the farts are pretty bad. I think I went overboard in going from eating like 10-15g of fiber a day to like 50g. I&#39;m going to try dial that back and then ramp it back up more slowly. So maybe more white rice and pasta for a bit as I give my GI tract more time to adjust to the massive amounts of fiber.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wqhcx8/wellness_wednesday_for_august_17_2022/ikpgcyx/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wqhcx8/wellness_wednesday_for_august_17_2022/ikpds17/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] I&#39;m near the end of pregnancy, and I&#39;ve got a few problems going on.

A month or so ago I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. It&#39;s not fair. Of the [risk factors](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/risk-factors.html):

&amp;gt;You’re at risk for gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant) if you:

&amp;gt;   * Had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy.
&amp;gt;   * Have given birth to a baby who weighed over 9 pounds.
&amp;gt;   * Are overweight.
&amp;gt;   * Are more than 25 years old.
&amp;gt;   * Have a family history of type 2 diabetes.
&amp;gt;   * Have a hormone disorder called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
&amp;gt;   * Are an African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander person.

I have one - over 25. Never been tested for PCOS, so I guess I can&#39;t completely rule that out, but there&#39;s a reason I&#39;ve never tested for it. As far as my doctor and I can tell, this was random chance. My pancreas isn&#39;t processing insulin right because of pregnancy hormones from the placenta. Now I have to track my diet for carb intake, limiting but not avoiding carbs, test my blood glucose, and maintain some daily exercise (been getting harder to do). The diet is the most frustrating part. Ok, no, the long term risks to both my baby and me are the most frustrating thing. There&#39;s not much risk of a large-baby-birth, which I&#39;ll come back to, but the birth issues are worrisome if unlikely, and then the higher chance of both of us getting type II diabetes is, again, unfair. I would like to know the weight of that risk when controlled for the other risk factors. When your gestational diabetes may have been random chance and not because of factors that also influence type II diabetes (weight, family history, activity level), how big is that risk increase? My doctor thinks in all likelihood everything will turn out fine as long as I stick with the plan.

As I mentioned, the low-carb diet is a bit frustrating. I&#39;ve adapted for the most part, but planning consistent meals is still tricky, particularly when my pizza-craving husband forgets my restrictions. We&#39;ve gone out of town a couple of times and had family come stay with us. Those worked out ok mostly. I had to find a couple of creative spots to test myself, and once while out I broke down in tears after spending 15 minutes looking over a couple of walkable cafes for a quick, low-carb lunch option only to find my choice opened at 11 but didn&#39;t start the kitchen until 11:30, when we had to be elsewhere. I had also skipped breakfast and passed up getting a latte, chai, or pastry, which would all be bad diet choices. In general, it takes a lot more time and thought to pick out a restaurant that won&#39;t wreck my numbers. So much bread, rice, potatoes, or noodles that I&#39;d rather not spend money on to not eat. And then there&#39;s looking up food nutrition, guessing what information gets close to what I&#39;m actually having. Not fun when calorie counting, even worse when my baby&#39;s health is on the line. Less bad when I&#39;m home and can go with home cooking, but still tedious.

On top of this, my baby keeps hovering in the 20th percentile of fetal weight. My doctor is a little concerned but otherwise chill about this, believing that he just may be a genetically small baby since I&#39;m small myself (5&#39;3&#34; and petite). My husband, however, is very worried about the negative effects of a low-weight birth and wants me to gain weight. That&#39;s not very compatible with what I&#39;m supposed to do to manage my gestational diabetes. Low carb cuts out a lot of high-calorie stuff, particularly *yummy* high-calorie foods. I may have dropped a pound in the first few days of the diagnosis, before I got the guidance, when all I came up with as &#34;safe to eat&#34; and easy was salad. Now I&#39;ve got more meat, dairy, and nuts in there. I&#39;ve agreed with my husband to try tracking my calories to make sure I am getting enough, and he&#39;s agreed to try to attend the next appointment to talk to my doctor about the baby&#39;s weight. It&#39;s stressful and bizarre to hear my husband say he wants me to get fat. I don&#39;t want my baby to be too small, but I also don&#39;t want to exacerbate the gestational diabetes by gaining excess weight. Throw in typical late pregnancy bad sleep, and it&#39;s all so stressful to balance. I&#39;d just like our little guy to get here healthy, safe, and sound.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wqhcx8/wellness_wednesday_for_august_17_2022/ikpds17/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wqhcx8/wellness_wednesday_for_august_17_2022/ikp4cjy/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] I have a £500 &#34;learning&#34; budget from work, and no idea what to spend it on.

Has it really been eight weeks?

The pregnancy has been coming along nicely. We&#39;ve had two sets of ultrasounds so far, and our kid is the size of a lemon now. I&#39;ve heard about pregnancy cravings, but I&#39;d never heard of pregnancy aversions. They&#39;re apparently a thing, and it hops from one food to the next, including long-time favorite foods, so finding something that she&#39;s willing to eat can be challenging. But morning sickness barely showed up, and nothing like in the movies, so we&#39;re thankful for that. We&#39;re starting to figure out how to rearrange the house and loosely thinking about names. Instead of paying some $700 for a DNA test now that would tell us the sex, we&#39;ll wait until the week 20 ultrasound to find out for free. In the meantime, I&#39;m more accustomed to using the singular *they* than my mom is, and accidentally had her thinking we were having twins since I kept saying *they*.

I visited my parents (on the other side of the country, so I&#39;m not there very often). I got there in time to help my dad come home from rehab, and help both my parents through a remodel of their ground floor to add a shower plus room for a wheelchair to negotiate through the bathroom. That way dad can have everything he needs without stairs. He eats very little, and when we try to encourage him, he says he &#34;just can&#39;t.&#34; Finding something that *he&#39;s* willing to eat can also be challenging. Because he&#39;s anemic, his doctor put him on prenatal vitamins as a cheap source of easy iron, and with a few things going on in his gut, he&#39;s gotten a few ultrasounds. It&#39;s odd how life rhymes sometimes. Since I&#39;ve been back on this side of the country, dad was in and out of the hospital another time. They suspected a fistula and he was going to get surgery, then they decided he doesn&#39;t have one and just gave him antibiotics. I&#39;ve lost count of how many times he&#39;s been in there in the last year and a half, and while each one is necessary at the time, each time he comes back weaker and has to spend weeks regaining his strength.

We also visited her parents (not as far away as mine, but far enough that it had been awhile). Since that trip, I&#39;ve found it hard to get back to the normal routine. It seems especially more difficult to get up in the morning, and I have to really push myself to get going. I hope it&#39;s just a slump. I think part of it is regretting that I moved away from my parents way back when, and that I&#39;ve spent so much time away from them. I think part of it is in some way realizing that I&#39;m going to be sleeping much less once the baby comes, and so I might as well enjoy it while I can. But I&#39;m also not enjoying it. It makes me feel like crap.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wqhcx8/wellness_wednesday_for_august_17_2022/ikmsgx0/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/iklaeru/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] So while we seem to have managed to add to the record every political hot take o</title><updated>2022-08-17T00:04:58Z</updated><author><name>GrapeGrater</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">So while we seem to have managed to add to the record every political hot take of the last week, we somehow completely missed the arrest of the Tornado Cash developer, Alexey Pertsev in Amsterdam. This is a fairly interesting omission from the forum in its own right as this forum has at least traditionally had a strong SF Tech overlap. 

But for those who didn&#39;t get the story, Tornado cash is a new Smart Contract that is intended to obscure the block-chain addresses used in transactions by bundling them together to obfuscate any single transaction. The US Treasury blacklisted the coin blacklisted and declared it illegal for Americans to own or use following it being used to funnel money to North Korea [see: https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1558129960140816384#m, https://www.pcmag.com/news/tornado-cash-developer-arrested-as-blacklisted-crypto-site-goes-down, https://www.foxbusiness.com/financials/dutch-authorities-arrest-suspected-developer-tornado-cash-platform-launder-billions]. 

Dutch authorities (Pertsev is Dutch) have claimed to have an independent investigation and the arrest was for concealing criminal financial flows and money laundering on behalf of the Dutch prosecutor&#39;s office. [https://nitter.net/sccanavos/status/1559530518043148290#m]

This obviously has many developers in arms. Tornado Cash was VC backed and worked to follow the law [https://nitter.net/jonst0kes/status/1558196851169452034#m, https://nitter.net/dystopiabreaker/status/1558196263190876161#m]

Fight For the Future (remember them?) and The EFF have weighed in favor of the developer [https://nitter.net/fightfortheftr/status/1559297577694429184#m, https://nitter.net/EFF/status/1559224086491934720#m] With the EFF taking the long-standing stance that code is free speech (remember that argument)?

Inflammatory title I know, but that&#39;s how traffic works these days. I beg forgiveness on that.

The article basically analyzes the conservative claim on social media from last week that the 87,000 tax collectors in the Inflation Reduction Act would be used to attack poor people. While the maps seem to indicate that, and further seem more specifically to be targeting *non-white people*, the truth of the matter is more nuanced. The audits are disproportionately attacking folks who file the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) due presumptively to some systemic flagging mechanism within the IRS. And since that&#39;s a measure specifically for poor people, their audits also predominantly hit poor people.

Part of this has to do with changes in staffing. They have more low grade &#34;tax examiners&#34; and fewer higher grade &#34;revenue agents,&#34; and the examiners are largely issuing &#34;correspondence audits&#34; which are simpler things which basically just demand more information. But since they&#39;re demanding them from poorer folks who may not have all the information or understand the cryptic language the correspondence audits are issued in, targeting them pumps the enforcement numbers up and makes the auditors look good.

So now if we set that on a shelf and examine one of the more popular definitions of &#34;systemic racism&#34; (Socioeconomic and government systems which produce differential racial outcomes) then it is apparent that the IRS&#39;s EITC flagging criteria are a result of a &#34;racist system&#34; because it fits the definition in use.

Whether this provision within the Inflation Reduction Act itself then qualifies as &#34;racist&#34; will in the end depend on whether the $80 billion earmark in the law includes a way to fix the racist system, or whether it will just be thrown at increasing operations as they currently exist, in which case the EITC audits will just increase.

Have you noticed that, in your middle-upper class bubble of fellow z-millennials, that a big chunk of people vote left only for lgbt rights?

I mean, anedoctically, a big percenteage of my acquiantances vote left only for that reason, also if they do not agree at all economically or politically with them (and are completely straight so they have no skin in the game) 

Real quotes:
&#34;I think that their economic policy is stupid, but I vote them for DDL Zan (a failed law on discrimination in Italy)&#34;
&#34; I hate them because they are not too left wing, but they support lgbt&#34;

I think there&#39;s starting to be a recognition that the fervor and policies born in 2020 were fairly flawed, as evidenced by the legacy of ideas like defund the police, and elections in fairly left areas in which people rejected the progressive candidates in places like NYC, NJ, VA, and SF (the [SF one](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/chesa-boudin-recall-san-francisco-crime/629907/) in particular is interesting. Chesa Boudin really served as a microcosm of progressivism who was given free reign, as were the city council elections that took place around the same time, thus his election served to some extent as a referendum on progressivism).

But what&#39;s interesting is that progressives, in self reflecting and having to analyze why this has occurred, have blamed progressive white people. And to a considerable degree the same thing has been occurring with respect to the policies corporations instituted during 2020. Which is so crazy to me. On the one hand, I agree and find overeducated white progressives who come from wealthy families to be among the most insufferable demographics. But on the other, their only real crime is that they listened to what was being demanded of them, that they be allies and use their supposed privilege to advance the views of anti-racists. It&#39;s kind of like they&#39;re being told &#34;Lol you thought we were serious with all of that stuff? What the fuck is wrong with you?&#34; It sort of validates the view that anti-racists have anti-white undercurrents. Like if they did unambiguously have anti-white undercurrents, how would they respond to the recognition of the ideological excesses of 2020? They would blame white people. Like if you’re a white progressive and want to support movements and ideas like that, at this point I don’t know what the fuck you’re supposed to do. If you don’t support it you’re part of the problem as identified by people you agree with, and if you do support it you’re going to be the scape goat when shit goes south and it becomes clear that the policies you supported to advance the ends you were told to advance were deeply flawed.

I think it also reveals a lack of strategy on the part of people working to advance those ideas, even within their own paradigm. Their view is that white people wield disproportionately more institutional power than non-white people do, so if that’s true you would want those people with outsized power and who agree with you to use that power to advance your ends. But instead they are condemning them and de-incentivizing their participation. It just seems very counterintuitive.

I think it really comes down to the fact that activists are insatiable. when they’re actually given the reins, asked what exactly they want, and allowed to implement policies, they don’t actually know. or if they do have proposals it&#39;s always impractically radical stuff that only makes sense to the small group of people who agree with them like just razing institutions and starting over or defunding the police or something equally as bizzare. it reminds me a lot of the occupy wall street people. They’re the dog that caught the car. They aren’t there to actually catch the car, they’re there to chase the car. implementing the change that they desire requires an understanding of things as they are (you have to understand the problem before you can develop a solution), but activists’ characteristic commitment to ideology precludes them from interpreting the world or developing solutions that go even a bit outside the scope of their ideology. Like can anyone seriously envision a series of events and policies that would have caused BLM to be like &#39;welp. that&#39;s pretty much what we were asking for. you did it and solved the problem. guess we can just pack up our shit and go home.&#39; like even over the course of their ideas being implemented over 10 years I can&#39;t envision that occurring. 

Progressive activists are the dog that caught the car, and once they caught the car and fucked it away they blamed it on the person who served as the distraction that slowed the car down and opened the door for the dog to do what it wanted to do. I think this is indicative of intellectual rot and my view is that to some extent the movement has been exposed and they sorta blew it when they had the spotlight.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikjpzhs/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikiyxbg/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Front Lines in Culture War: Diversity in Policing

I attend town hall meetings in my neighborhood pretty regularly. There&#39;s a new guy who started showing up, and most of his input is focused around &#34;why aren&#39;t you hiring enough minority police?&#34; Because identity matters, he&#39;s a white male in his 30s.

I notice a distinct lack of charity on my end towards his position. The jumping to conclusions are arguments you might have seen before: &#34;He probably doesn&#39;t know any himself, who is he to talk?&#34;, &#34;He&#39;s probably not helping any apply, why isn&#39;t he doing the work to solve this?&#34;, &#34;Who is this White Knight, and why is he expecting other people to do the heavy lifting?&#34; &#34;He probably doesn&#39;t want any people he knows to be police anyway. Does he want to make mental room to be secretly racist, but have plausible deniability because they&#39;re cops?&#34;

The last one, of course, is a terrible conclusion. But it&#39;s still a thought I had, and TBH is also a comment I&#39;d expect someone else to post here. I&#39;m not happy about assuming the worst of him. That he is a sneaky fucker, Literally Hitler In Sheep&#39;s Clothing.

The obvious solution is to find time to take him aside &amp;amp; ask him the questions I&#39;ve had in my head. What steps to take after then, though?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikiyxbg/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikie0e8/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Haven&#39;t noticed an example of this before- in a Spiderman game just ported from </title><updated>2022-08-16T12:24:15Z</updated><author><name>_Cullis</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Haven&#39;t noticed an example of this before- in a Spiderman game just ported from PS5 to PC, someone made a mod that replaced flags referring to [our civic religion](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/08/gay-rites-are-civil-rites/)\*  with flags referring to the previous [civic religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_religion).

I did, however, find [this post](https://the-grey-tribe.tumblr.com/post/676558263243997184/there-are-too-many-video-games) arguing about a [Jeff Vogel article](https://bottomfeeder.substack.com/p/there-are-too-many-video-games) about there being too many indie video games.

Leaving aside the...very debateable mertits of said article, this reinforced something that I&#39;ve been thinking about today: is there too much *everything?*

To lay out the life of a modern Western person: there is practically-infinite entertainment to be found, and little worthy work to apply oneself to. Decades ago, supposedly, there were jobs that one could take pride in or even enjoy, and you had to take what you could get for entertainment. Today, there&#39;s so many video games, YouTube videos, TV shows, movies, Twitch livestreams, books, music, and so on to consume. Hundreds of thousands of people are constantly adding onto this pile of information, not to mention a lot the good stuff that came before is still accessible today. This sounds like the end part of Metal Gear Solid 2, which outlines a vision of informational overload, civilizational senesence brought on from the halting of traditional informational eugenics. MGS2 was said to have predicted the Internet&#39;s impact and social media, but I feel that this issue of [monumentality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwGKqiOyIAM), of living in a world with vastly more information than you could ever hope to consume in your lifetime, would not have been forestalled in a world without social media or internet forums.

There&#39;s also the dismal material aspects to consider. The world&#39;s population is somewhere just north of 8 billion, every grocery store is stocked with food products engineered for mass-producibility and cheapness at the cost of other desirable factors, and every person&#39;s estimated impact on politics or productivity is likely so infitesimal as to not matter at all. It seems like getting any job more complex or higher-paying than a burger-flipper or Amazon warehouse worker is a competition where luck is as much of a factor as merit or credentials. On one hand, there are going to be a lot of people who are going to be eliminated from the job market by automation. On the other hand, there may not be enough money to support so many people with welfare. On the third hand, however, the US is no stranger to playing funny games with the nominal numbers of dollar bills that are sent into &#34;the wild.&#34;

Maybe this is just the painful transition period, the growing pains. Perhaps in the future, we will deftly handle these problems brought about by the monumentality of civilization: every job that is too competitive or unrewarding now will be automated, every person will be provided for, and maybe, just maybe, we can still forage *meaning* out of life. Maybe some catastrophe will burn through the forest of human civilization and free up slack in the system (but that&#39;s a big maybe, assuming said catastrophe doesn&#39;t make things so bad that we can never recover). Or maybe things just continue onwards and the human race blindly enters into the biggest rat race of all.

Maybe this is all just my own particular anxieties. I&#39;m more of an artist, I don&#39;t code, and while I&#39;m no stranger to lifting a finger for a job, a fair bit of that was sweeping floors and washing dishes at college. Vogel complains about potholes in his article, but what is there to do when you have no hope of making it as neither an artist nor a road worker?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikhznez/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikgw9wl/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] What do you think the effect of zero code automation will have on employment in </title><updated>2022-08-16T02:31:29Z</updated><author><name>AlternativeEvent2584</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">What do you think the effect of zero code automation will have on employment in the future? I&#39;m talking about companies like Appian (who someone I know from my CS program works at) or Microsoft&#39;s power platform. I&#39;m more familiar with the latter, but from playing around with it, it seems like it will allow non-coders to essentially automate everything themselves. For example, at my own job we&#39;re doing a little trial where we&#39;re basically trying out one of our departments automating away the need for temps. This MS Power Platform can create GUIs, connect to SQL databases, write to SharePoint, work with APIs, and many other things. So the goal is to essentially have this department automate this and see if we can get it all working. 

If we can, then temps will essentially be gone. And this is only going to get better as time goes on. Furthermore, it will eliminate the need for a bunch of our sys admins because we&#39;re currently moving everything to Azure/365 so they will have nothing to manage.

If zero code works, this might invert the current view of everything being eliminated by coders and instead subject matter experts in accounting or whatever will do the automating themselves even though they can&#39;t code. The top level coders at places like Microsoft will automate away the need for low level coders and sys admins and then they will just collect on those Power Platform E5 licenses. 

I&#39;m new to this as of a few weeks ago so I could be completely off here.

*A few jumbled thoughts, rearranged into Linear Ilfortese B on the advice of /u/f3zinker.*  

With the beta rollout of Stable Diffusion (previously [shilled here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij9ge8b/)), digital artists [have finally taken notice](https://mobile.twitter.com/arvalis/status/1558623545374023680) of text-to-image models, and particularly their ability to imitate individual, modern stylesˆ1 . It seems artists have abruptly phase-transitioned en masse from naysaying to fear and rage, and have promptly shut down @StableDiffusion acc with malicious reporting, in what may eventually be recorded in history books as one of the opening shots in the inevitable Neo-Luddite backlash transcending industries and political tribes. (Additionally: fresh HN discussion of [copyright infringement in AI art](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32436203), of [Stable Diffusion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32471199).) 

The gnashing of teeth, gloating, motivated reasoning, [politruk-level understanding of art itself](https://mobile.twitter.com/senfflasche/status/1559311057310580736), [political allies](https://twitter.com/AmandaTNStevens/status/1557766146920783873/retweets/with_comments) and amusing narcissism ([«The tiniest cock I draw has more soul than what an AI could spit out»](https://twitter.com/Rattfood/status/1559007094598246402)) are all exactly what I&#39;ve had in mind when saying that I don&#39;t like artists as a class of people and welcome their impending professional decimation by AI (a take [which invited some opposition](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijoupt6/)). Of course they&#39;ll fight back. Going beyond Twitter antics, they voice a somewhat reasonable hope for class action lawsuits and encouragement of broader regulation. Artists naturally can have power in excess of their SES, and they love to flex it. Probably it can work, if the powers that be see utility to facilitating their crusade. And maybe (returning to my constant concerns) we&#39;ll see this used as a *casus belli* for a huge push for prohibition of general-purpose compute in private hands (embraced by Lesswrongian AI alarmists and EAs, and Bostrom-WEF technocratic goons). And AI art will be reduced to some gimped alternatives like cloud-only Adobe Photoshop with $5.99 monthly fee for «in the style of James Gurney» meta-brush, with royalties to James or his publisher or estate.ˆ2   

Then again, maybe it&#39;ll fall through. Torrents are still here. And good luck regulating away secure comms like Matrix or Briar or, hell, PGP emails. And Stable Diffusion checkpoints are already being spread around, and a rig with four second-hand 3090s from bankrupt Ethereum miners will be enough for *a great deal* of inference. Most importantly, there&#39;s enough interestˆ3 . Like [Emad says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ2QtKcK2dA) in the recent excellent interviewˆ4, billions of people are *creatively constipated* and they want to let it all out. This may not be singularity yet, but it&#39;s a classical [revolutionary situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_situation). To wit, the case where preservation of status quo would require drastic changes tearing away at its other aspects, introducing unsustainable runaway processes.ˆ5  

The question is, *how* does this continue? Images are of course the least of our problems. Emad can&#39;t wait to automate all forms of media production, and the market will do the rest for «normal» jobs. Savvier artists are, predictably given their socialist leanings but IMO very rationally, advocating [for basic income](https://twitter.com/basicincomecdn/status/1557374154478964737). Alas, it&#39;s not that good, and it may not be the lowest-effort adaptation of our society as it grapples with runaway optimization processes.ˆ6 And beyond that, there are direct AI risks, both existential due to alignment failure (which I&#39;m skeptical about) and ones obvious from human history. But even for art alone, consider these asinine outcomes: 

- Neuralink-powered DRM: content-as-a-service streamed directly into the brain, with per-qualia billing, data interpretable only on this individual human connectome (connectome «keys» owned by Neuralink Corporation, accessed by streaming services through an API), with extreme financial and medical ramifications of tinkering. Episodic memory wiping for extra [dystopian flavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFe9wiDfb0E) (but you keep your ratings, reviews and habits!). For extra [Cheems mindset](https://normielisation.substack.com/p/cheems-mindset): ID-locked screens/output devices with always-online perceptive hash tracking of all consoomable content.  
- Actual anarchy wiping out incentives for professional artistic work. The culture up to 2022 compressed into language to summon combinations, endless Age of the Feuilleton that Hesse adumbrated in his *The Glass Bead Game*. No more innovative one-upmanship of starving artists who sink decades into grokking the craft and exploring its rabbit holes, just «X trending on artstation 8K» forever.

It&#39;s a failure of imagination to go for those. But the status quo can&#39;t continue. [The defaults don&#39;t work.](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/the-defaults-dont-work/) We need to up the learning rate to guess at the future. 

Importantly, what will happen with ideology inherent in contemporary art? Emad promises to train custom models for companies like Sony and Nintendo, and I suppose those will be very good (and if Stability.ai fails, eventually Sony will do it on their own or buy something from a startup or FAANG). But there probably are diminishing returns to the effect of raw quality and quantity on how compelling art feels.  
If you can crank out CalArts style cartoons (assuming people like that style *per se*) with right-wing talking points, and Disney or Netflix animators will do the same but 3x better with their stale propaganda of [embracing monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Beast_(2022_film)), will it matter a lot? Memes with crudely drawn pepes and chads are viral enough; indie games and Minecraft are insanely successful. The Last Of Us II was, I think, [a vessel for Druckmann&#39;s politics](https://collider.com/last-of-us-2-joel-death-neil-druckmann/), and it didn&#39;t persuade people a great deal (on the other hand, people still cite the sophomoric critique of libertarianism in Bioshock, brought to you by Ken Levine, so that depends on specifics). if Druckmann and Levine have the equivalent of Unreal Engine 6 with [automatic generation of arbitrary assets and most code](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/2/23287173/ai-image-generation-art-midjourney-multiverse-interview-david-holz), and Zorba and his friend have the equivalent of mere UE 4 with the same properties, downgraded – will it matter that the former duo has access to AAA tier promotion and the latter just go on Steam and get word-of-mouth fame? 

Finally, will artistry, «style», *stylization* itself survive when it&#39;s not scarce? Will it advance to its llimits?ˆ7 Or will the people, surfeited with it, cast away gimmicks and choose simple, beautiful, ecologically valid naturalism with well-told archetypal stories? Or on the contrary, decide that Apple was right and legible schematics that are easy on the mind are the best – art fading away much like the adolescent Android modding and ricing of desktops?  Will it shard into tiny niche superstimuli, or will generic ones be quickly discovered? How will this play together with VR, Metaverse and its private equivalents, and generational churn? 

I honestly have no idea.

Situation remains the same as last week, no major changes. Russia continues to advance at an extremally slow place where they have concentrated artillery, Ukraine continues to attempt to will a counteroffensive into existence through spiral energy.

That said:

Igor Girkin get&#39;s arrested trying to enter the donbas illegally to fight on the front lines. While I, personally, think he is a huge piece of shit it is admirable that he will put his money where his mouth is. 

Russia reportedly  transferring some of their equivalent to training battalions to the conflict areas. This should add some spine to their infantry, and add some offensive teeth to their forces.

On the Ukrainian side:

A Russian airbase in Crimea exploded due to a dropped Lucky Strike. No aerospace equipment was damaged in the massive fireball, according to Russia. Arial photography later confirms at least 6 su-24s and 3(?) su-30s(?) destroyed. The airstrip remains intact, as far as anyone knows. 

In addition, Ukraine has claimed (with iffy visual evidence) to have rendered the Antonivsky and Kakhovka(Man, I don&#39;t know. Languages are hard) bridges unusable for vehicle traffic. Observers have reported fuel and ammunition shortages in Kherson consistent with two blown bridges, but we wont know for sure for a couple days/weeks.

Ukraine claims these strikes were caried out by purely indigenous systems; missle-fuckers think it might be a Hiluxized Neptune antiship missile retrofitted to hit land targets (bridges), which are a type of ship if you think hard enough.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

War remains slow and steady; with predicted russian counter-counter-offensives in the south, and Kherson continues to be the biggest &#39;pocket&#39; since the korean war if it ever actually happens.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikgj8k4/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikg3ior/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] So, if ya&#39;ll wanna feel some second hand embarrassment, watch the Jim Acosta int</title><updated>2022-08-15T23:01:06Z</updated><author><name>dblackdrake</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">So, if ya&#39;ll wanna feel some second hand embarrassment, watch the Jim Acosta interview with Andrew Yang re. the forward party, featuring lines straight out of the [Simpsons](https://youtu.be/HqjhHVUzl8o) such as

First of all, this caused me emotional trauma as a dude who was on the technocratic yang train back when he seemed like a going concern, before he had enough exposure to prove he had no idea what the fuck he was doing politically. I still think his heart is in the right place, but even if I were Hugo Chaves I wouldn&#39;t put him into an office where he would have to try to negotiate any sort of real compromise. 

Second, it makes me wish we could lock every elected official and candidate in a room with a non-hostile but also non-friendly interviewer and not let them out until they have committed to all their positions and defended them at least a bit.

Finally, this further confirms my bias re Centrism and how it either impossible in practice or a contradiction in terms; that if you somehow founded a third party in the US it could do nothing but add another pole.

For those who aren&#39;t familiar, here&#39;s a rundown: Prior to WWII, most urban poor (minorities in particular) lived in overcrowded tenement housing. This was privately-owned, market-rate housing, but conditions were considered substandard at the time and are unthinkable now. A lot of the apartments lacked windows or any kind of ventilation, most units had shared bathrooms, and some still relied on outhouses (in the city) into the 1950s. A lot of the stuff that would easily fail a code inspection now was par for the course. Conditions were crowded to the point that, as one woman recalls, her mother had to sleep in the kitchen as they had to fit 12 people into a 3 room apartment. 

Following the War, there was an increased drive to move tenement-dwellers into modern apartments. This drive had actually started prior to the War, but gained increased impetus when the Housing Act of 1949 made Federal money available to construct housing projects. Throughout the &#39;20s and &#39;30s, the modernist architecture movement had provided a blueprint of how the ideal city should look, and city planners took full advantage of these architects when money became available to put their plans into action. (A detailed description of modern architectural principles is beyond the scope of this post, but if you&#39;re unfamiliar, look up Corbusier to get an idea of what we&#39;re dealing with). 

At first, the project was deemed a smashing success. The design won awards. Early residents talked about how, for the first time in their lives, they were living somewhere where everything was new, and clean, and there was adequate space. On woman said she felt like she was moving into a high-end resort. Another, who was a child at the time, talked about moving in around Christmas, with the moon shining off the snow and lights in every window, and how it felt magical, like they&#39;d finally escaped the slums.

Needless to say, this feeling didn&#39;t last. Within a few years, the place was in noticeable decline, and within ten, it was practically hell on earth. Maintenance issues, exacerbated by vandalism, added danger and seediness. Vacancy rates were high, leading entire buildings to eventually be abandoned, some of which were taken over by drug gangs. Robbery and rape were common in the now unlit stairwells and in the vast expanses between buildings residents entering to complex from the outside had to negotiate to get to their apartments. Security was lax, and police and other emergency personnel were reluctant to respond to calls for fear of their own safety. While an activist organization was able to form to seek redress for these issues, social cohesion was otherwise low, as most law-abiding residents felt unsafe outside their apartments. Throughout the city and nationwide, Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis became a metaphor for everything that was wrong with the inner-city.

In 1968, the activist group staged a rent strike to force the housing authority to address the maintenance and safety issues. The authority, who had for years blamed these issues on lack of funding, asked how they could address any of them if they were starved of the one funding source they could rely on. But the residents had only seen things worsen over the years and wondered what they were paying for. Eventually, the city caved, and rent was capped at 25% of income and there was a commitment to address the maintenance issues. This victory was short-lived, however, as cold air getting in through broken windows that had not been fixed caused water lines to freeze and flood the remaining occupied buildings. At this point, just 15 years after opening, the project was deemed a lost cause, and the remaining residents were slowly relocated elsewhere. In 1972, the project was closed permanently, and all the buildings were demolished by 1976. 

Art critics and historians often point to the day in 1972 that the first set of buildings were imploded as &#34;the day modernism died&#34;. The contention is that the high-minded principles espoused by Le Corbusier and others had been proven empirically incorrect by what Pruitt–Igoe and other, similar high-rise projects had become. This new generation of critics could cite a laundry list of fallacious assumptions that the modernists had made, and, after all, you could tell just by looking at places like Brasilia and Le Corbusier&#39;s designs for a new Paris that these weren&#39;t places anyone would want to live. The modernists were designing for an idealized version of man, and accordingly ended up disregarding basic human needs. Thus we get living space that is too small, outdoor promenades and piazzas that nobody really uses for anything, etc. On a more straightforward note, social scientists argue that it&#39;s simply a bad idea to put large numbers of struggling people all in one large building, as these projects end up breeding all kinds of horrible pathologies. 

As you may have guessed, *The Pruitt–Igoe Myth* fights back against these assumptions. The main thrust of their argument is that complaining about the architecture completely ignores the socioeconomic and demographic factors that led to the most immediate problems. The Federal Housing Act provided money for construction, but not for maintenance; it was assumed that maintenance costs would be paid for out of rents. However, the project had been built based on projections that the population of St. Louis would rise over the coming decades. The population of the city itself ended up decreasing from a high of 850,000 in 1950 to only about 620,000 in 1970, fueled by increasing suburbanization. Accordingly, the project had a high vacancy rate from day one, and the money the housing authority was relying on for maintenance never materialized. As the maintenance backlog increased and the city population decreased, the budget went into a death spiral from which it couldn&#39;t recover. Meanwhile, a declining population meant that housing in more desirable areas was becoming available at low prices, so the project, which was originally intended to be a mix of low and middle income residents, ended up only attracting those who had nowhere else to go. It also touches on ancillary issues like racism, lack of policing, Federal housing policy, etc., but it doesn&#39;t go into them in too great of detail. 

Does it succeed in making its thesis? Sort of. The theory is plausible on its face, and it certainly explains why the project failed so soon. The problem is that similar projects were tried in practically every major American city, and there isn&#39;t one anyone can point to as a success. Some of these places did last well into the 2000s, but the film doesn&#39;t examine any of them to see if their problems were due to similar factors. Anecdotally speaking, Pittsburgh&#39;s housing projects supposedly didn&#39;t get bad until the mid-&#39;80s, but this is coming from residents and not statistics. Again, these problems were also supposedly exacerbated by lack of maintenance, so it&#39;s hard to say whether the producers of the film are on to something. One crucial distinction here, though, is that most of Pittsburgh&#39;s housing projects are and were low rises, and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any correlation between how bad a project is and how big the building is. This is in contrast to the complaints of the art critics and some of the social scientists, who argued that low-rise developments were inherently superior because they were better integrated into the existing community. The counterargument here is that Pittsburgh&#39;s low-rises weren&#39;t integrated into the community at all—they were usually places on isolated hilltops or in ravines, and often had only one way in and out. So I don&#39;t know what to make of this.

The other issue is that all this discussion about modernism and art critics—it&#39;s not in the film, I just happen to be familiar with it. This is the film&#39;s biggest flaw; there&#39;s a theory on why the project failed but no discussion of the theory behind why it was supposed to work or in-depth examination of the criticisms of that theory once the failure became apparent. Instead we get mostly reminiscences from former residents interspersed with a few comments from a social scientist. There&#39;s certainly no examination of the counterarguments.

The reason I wanted to write this up here is because the film&#39;s central thesis is intriguing in light of our current housing crisis and homelessness problem. I was riding my bike along the Riverfront trails in Pittsburgh last weekend and I noticed that tents lined the path wherever there was room for them. The previous mayor had a lax attitude toward homeless enforcement but this was different; the tents were well-kept and the people living in them didn&#39;t really look homeless. There was no evidence of drinking or drug use other than the occasional beer, and one ten&#39;s door was open and the inside was reasonably organized. It should also be mentioned that vagrancy downtown was a problem during the Peduto administration but it&#39;s not nearly as bad now, so there&#39;s obviously some additional enforcement going on. I found out later that the people living in these tents have housing vouchers from the county nut there&#39;s nowhere to put them, so they were given tents and permission to set them up until they find apartments. For most of my life, I had been inclined to agree with most of the experts, that public housing was a bad idea for all the usual reasons. But if the result of relying on Section 8 and affordable set asides in market-rate developments just leads to a housing shortage, is it really worse than the alternative? Large projects may be bad, but it&#39;s probably better than sleeping on the street. Furthermore, are they inherently bad, or only bad because of mismanagement and failure to deal with vacancies? These are tough questions, but unfortunately, *The Pruitt–Igoe Myth* doesn&#39;t answer them.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikelhsn/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ike8dlh/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Is there any serious argument against a free market in human organs if you&#39;re a </title><updated>2022-08-15T15:43:23Z</updated><author><name>MelodicBerries</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Is there any serious argument against a free market in human organs if you&#39;re a libertarian?

I’m trying to figure out whether reticuline is neurotoxic like alcohol or something more serious. There’s some cool herbalism involving it but I don’t want to take chances.

I can only find its toxicity in relation to Annonacin where it’s written “annonacin is a thousand times (1000x) more toxic to cultured neuronal cells than reticuline”. Regarding annonacin, “Studies in rodents indicate that consumption of annonacin (3.8 and 7.6 mg per kg per day for 28 days) caused brain lesions consistent with Parkinson&#39;s disease. An adult who consumes a fruit or can of nectar daily over the course of a year is estimated to ingest the same amount of annonacin that induced brain lesions in the rodents receiving purified annonacin intravenously.”

One study has,

&amp;gt;we exposed mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in culture to the total extract (totum) of alkaloids from Annona muricata root bark and to two of the most abundant subfractions, corexi- mine and reticuline. After 24 hours, 50% of dopaminergic neu- rons degenerated with 18 􏰀g/ml totum, 4.3 􏰀g/ml (13 􏰀M) coreximine, or 100 􏰀g/ml (304 􏰀M) reticuline.

Now a lancet correspondence from 99 says,

&amp;gt; Although the two studies did conclude that simple 1-benzylated TIQs are “relatively weak neurotoxins” that can cause behavioural signs of parkinsonism in animal models, they did not examine the structurally more complex reticuline, a morphinan precursor (or any of its N-methylated alkaloidal derivatives or metabolites). As with many isoquinoline alkaloids, reticuline has pharmacological activity at diverse neurotransmitter synapses and uptake sites. However, a myriad of studies going back nearly 30 years have never revealed it to be neurotoxic. If anything, with its phenolic groups, reticuline is more likely to be a n t i o x i d a t i v e 4 , 5 a n d , t h u s, n e u r o - protective against the free radical- initiated toxicity that is commonly linked to neurodegenerative mechanisms.

The cell culture study looks pretty bad though.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wnz8wv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_14_2022/ik995xh/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wnz8wv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_14_2022/ik8mt3g/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Has the world gone fucking insane?

One of the applications of language models is [Question answering](https://paperswithcode.com/task/question-answering/latest) systems. They seem to fit nicely subscription-based business model. Here’s how it works: 

1. You specify the domain and scope of knowledge, that you want to encapsulate 
2. You hire a team of experts and extract knowledge from them (or from a suit of books). Since the model is pretrained for general reasoning, it only needs to fine-tune itself according to specifications from the previous step. The model queries people and processes their answers until ~~they confess~~ target quality is achieved 
3. Subscribers select domain, “number of queries per month” and a multitude of other parameters like “model capacity”, “answer granularity”, “knowledge provider”, “dialogue memory”, etc. 
4. Then you &#34;stream&#34; it, using web or app interface

Towards complete commodification of knowledge, capitalism has been dreaming of, with pipeline and valve. Few features:

1. Linear mode is still available – you can read long chunks w/t querying model piece by piece 
2. Everyone can pack their knowledge into a model and publish it online. What if someone publishes something bad? Right, that’s why each model gets checked and licensed by benevolent third party 
3. You can merge/import data from other models/books/humans; manually override it; you can grow model continuously  
4. Various kinds of knowledge might be embedded: factual, procedural, black-box &#34;tacit&#34; functions and arbitrary uncertainty distributions around them</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik6fadf/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik3a798/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] On Wordle, I’ve decided to start playing “yesterday’s” word as my first guess th</title><updated>2022-08-13T04:31:23Z</updated><author><name>DuplexFields</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">On Wordle, I’ve decided to start playing “yesterday’s” word as my first guess the following day. It’s a suboptimal strategy when the previous solution has doubles of a given letter (or two), but it gives me a sense of continuity and challenge, and beats starting with “SLATE” or “ARIEL” every day.

What are your favorite Wordle tools?

My primary tool is Notepad, wherein I use the notation of capital letters for certainties, lowercase for possibilities and dashes for impossibilities. Let’s say the word is “&amp;gt;!NIGHT!&amp;lt;” and I’ve guessed “GRAIN”, “SPROG”, and “THERE”, getting no greens, some yellows, and all five letters by the third guess. If I didn’t immediately think of &#34;&amp;gt;!NIGHT!&amp;lt;&#34;, I’d type these in like so:

    G: -ggg-
    I: iii-i
    N: nnnn-
    T: -tttt
    H: h-hhh

I also have an Excel spreadsheet with every word in Wordle’s “guess” dictionary and none from the “solutions” dictionary, so I’ll never accidentally see the real answer. The five letters are each in their own columns, in a filterable List, so in the above example I can eliminate RASPO from all columns after the second guess and E after the third. If I’m still stumped, I can eliminate G from the first and last column, I from the fourth, and so on, and see what’s left to make another guess to eliminate up to five more letters. Of course, in this example I’ve got all five letters by my third guess, so I could just turn off all but those letters, and maybe turn some back on, to eliminate additional positions.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik3a798/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik2r0a7/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Spent my day install a cell booster on my house.

Ever since a big storm rolled through knocking everything over, and leading to some debate about whether we experienced a downburst or a tornado, my Verizon signal has been in the toilet.  So, $400 later, and some rather nervous work on a ladder, we now have a serviceable signal again.  It was a constant thorn in our side since moving out to the country, so hopefully that problem is fully well fixed now.

Been seriously binging Xenoblade Chronicles 3 more.  I got seriously side tracked by optional quests, and am now overleveled for the core story in front of me by about 10 levels.  The job system is **ok** so far.  I think what&#39;s hampering my enjoyment is the temporary cap of 10 levels per job I&#39;m currently laboring under.  So my characters max out their jobs rather quickly, and I find myself rotating them to new ones, not because I want to, but because I feel like I have to in order to min max.  And I&#39;m constantly running short of jobs I actually want to switch them into.  I&#39;m looking forward to the cap coming off.

Hit my first tantalizing and obvious reference to previous Xenoblade games, hinting at the world this is taking place in.  The trailer had hinted at things, and I&#39;m curious to see if the hints come to fruition.  But I think the Xenoblade &#34;timeline&#34; is a lot like the Zelda &#34;timeline&#34;.  Mostly bullshit theory crafting around thoughtlessly included references that give the games a unified feel, but aren&#39;t meant for serious theorizing.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik2r0a7/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik2c9wm/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] I think I have a leucistic duck on my pond.

Spoilers below. A recent thread on askreddit had people complain about the ending and since my reply inevitably got buried, I thought I&#39;d repost and expand on it here. 

I have a separate thought about the series&#39; politics but I&#39;m posting that as a reply.

The prompt:

    despite the lackluster ending

Ughhh the ending annoyed me so much.

Pretty much from the beginning I had my nerd guess for what was gonna happen:

It turns out that using element zero (which causes the &#34;mass effect&#34;) increases entropy massively. After all, all that energy has to come from somewhere. Use it too much and the universe runs out or [insert doomsday scenario]. So the leviathans build the reapers to find a way to fix or contain it, then the reapers go a little overboard and murder everyone before &#34;seeding&#34; new civilizations to gather data on the mass effect. Things are going pretty well apart from the everyone getting murdered at the end of the experiment cycle part.

I like that I could see an indoctrination ending as the &#34;good&#34; ending here - if you have to choose between trillions dying and the universe ending, maybe the former is the better option? But of course, who knows if the reapers will even find a solution, if the other civs can&#39;t do it on their own w/o regular genocide, etc. There&#39;s room for disagreement, which I think is a necessary component of a good RPG ending. 

The actual ending feels dumb even by soft sci-fi standards. It&#39;s almost literally [they&#39;re made of meat](https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html). Apparently &#34;organics&#34; and &#34;synthetics&#34; just never get along. Never mind that synthetic is just a short-hand for semiconductor technology since that&#39;s the level where our civilization is at, and never mind that we&#39;d totally make self-repairing computers out of wet hydrocarbons if we could. Also disregard the fact that organic/synthetic just describes what is essentially a manufacturing process and should have little impact on ones feelings / value functions beyond naive looks-like-me ingroup bias (and why would you put that in synthetic life anyway?). The entire universal conflict is sibling rivalry with some AI risk thrown in.

I grant that this can be read as an AI risk device - the Leviathans, demi-gods from Ye Olden Times, notice that whenever their thralls build synthetic life, the latter rebels against the former. This tends to result in genocide. Replace &#34;life&#34; with &#34;generally intelligent agent&#34; and it&#39;s not a strange prediction. It would be kind of a stretch to have the leviathans a) be smart enough to meaningfully resist the AIs of their thralls and b) decide that building their own AI in the form of the reapers is a great idea, especially since that plan backfires as much as it possibly could. But who knows, maybe all the smart leviathans are working on thrall containment policy and reapers are a big political mess.

It still makes the ending fall kinda flat, imo. The choices of &#34;destroy, control, do nothing&#34; lack meaning if all you&#39;re deciding on is how to deal with a malaligned AI. 

IIRC some other game had the entropy plot as its big reveal, so maybe ME didn&#39;t want to seem too unoriginal, but I think it&#39;s still one of the better choices: It&#39;s narratively cheap since much of ME&#39;s plot still makes sense in retrospect. Geth calculate utility and conclude that the reapers are correct. Organic life doesn&#39;t and is also highly interested in staying alive, so the only way to align them is direct mind control. In the anti-Reaper ending you decide that humanity can fix the Mass Effect on your own (Renegade) or with the help of the rest of the universe (Paragon). In the pro-Reaper ending you either zip humanity into a new Reaper or die honorably and let them deal with the problem. I can totally see myself playing both and that rarely happens for me with &#34;good/evil&#34; playthroughs.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik0elg5/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik01wij/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Has anyone obtained value from the ikigai / kanban / self-authoring / etc progra</title><updated>2022-08-12T14:48:29Z</updated><author><name>Difficult_Ad_3879</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">Has anyone obtained value from the ikigai / kanban / self-authoring / etc programs?
