The EU Centre for Disease Control has a [report](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C31&amp;amp;q=%E2%80%9CImplementing+actions+to+minimise+the+presence+of+the+virus+in+the+sewage+system%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;btnG=#d=gs_qabs&amp;amp;t=1659048407870&amp;amp;u=%23p%3Dfzr8qRg_B9MJ) that reads —

&amp;gt;Implementing actions to
 minimise the presence of the virus in the sewage system, where numerous rodents are living, should be considered.

A Veterinary research paper on Monkeypox [from 2004](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.418.2491&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf) speculated that —

&amp;gt; One can envision prairie dogs, perhaps infected with monkeypox, plague, or tularaemia, populating the sewers of Tokyo or Los Angeles, only to emerge to engender some new public health plague, as a sort of horrific life imitates art event, akin to a Grade B horror film

A doctor, though without relevant credential, had [the following tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/denise_dewald/status/1552226260071366657) go viral —

&amp;gt;Once monkeypox is detectable in the wastewater, it’s game over for eradication; the sewers are swarming with rats. It will become endemic. We will need to resume universal vaccination against smallpox/monkeypox. Monkeypox has been found in the wastewater in San Francisco.

Lastly, San Francisco is going to declare a state of emergency.

I think people who do not know what San Francisco is like might not realize that there is sufficient cross-reservoir contact being rats and humans to cause a crisis. A pizza place on the block where I lived was shuttered because people saw rats on their counter at closing hours. The entryway was later inhabited by a junkie who spread his feces and needles around the sidewalks, where dogs were often walked. Vagrants are frequent flyers at the hospitals, sometimes against their will, meaning police snd EMTs will have to use full PPE. The public library will likely have to close because the homeless of San Francisco congregate there to use the restrooms and open doors (without washing hands) and occasionally picking up a book or using a computer. The restrooms at Starbucks are continually used not just by the homeless but by tourists and busy people.

Implying that a dozen heroin-using homeless individuals acquire monkeypox, my intuition is that it could lead to a sustained public health problem.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ii1xays/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w9703v/wellness_wednesday_for_july_27_2022/ii0xv4c/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] How do those of you in the private sector estimate your salary and value?

I&#39;m job hunting again and a lot of job applications are asking for a salary range. In the military my salary was almost entirely up to the whims of Congress so I never really thought about it that much. I have a pretty precise budget so I know the minimum I can live on, but I&#39;m having trouble figuring out how high to go on top of that. On the one hand, I don&#39;t want to price myself out of a job but on the other hand I don&#39;t want to lowball myself and get taken for a ride.

This boggles my mind. The only explanation I can think of is that they&#39;re trying to be sensitive to the visually impaired, but even that makes no sense. A person who was born blind has no idea what color is and will never be able to comprehend it. A person who lost their vision later in life probably wouldn&#39;t care what anyone at the table looks like, because they&#39;re there to exchange ideas. Moreover, if the goal is to tell people what you look like, then why focus on clothing? Do the people responsible for this custom have such limited visual imagination that they think a person&#39;s appearance can be compressed down to a handful of assumptions based on gender and color of clothing? (Come to think of it, that sounds like [Corporate Memphis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Memphis). Maybe there&#39;s a connection there)

Any explanation or steelman would be appreciated.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ii0uqkg/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ii0b74z/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Last week someone asked that we do a regular policy tracking/analysis thing each</title><updated>2022-07-28T16:27:02Z</updated><author><name>Sorie_K</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Last week someone asked that we do a regular policy tracking/analysis thing each week at the Motte and I think that sounds grand, so here&#39;s some updates.

Last night Democratic senators and the Biden team finally hammered out the long awaited deal with Senate final boss Joe Manchin.  The resulting Inflation Reduction Act is tiny compared to the price tag on the original Build Back Better Act but still hits at a lot of major priorities.  The [full text](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22122281-inflation_reduction_act_of_2022) is here if you&#39;re interested, a breezy read at 725 pages.  This [one page summary](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22122297-inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary) gives a quick breakdown, and [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/manchin-climate-tax-bill.html) has a pretty solid summary of the key stuff:

&amp;gt;The package would set aside $369 billion for climate and energy proposals, the most ambitious climate action ever taken by Congress, and raise an estimated $451 billion in new tax revenue over a decade, while cutting federal spending on prescription drugs by $288 billion, according to a summary circulated Wednesday evening.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;. . .  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The two health care pieces would allow Medicare to directly regulate the price of prescription drugs for the first time beginning in 2023. It would also extend through 2025 an expansion of premium subsidies that Democrats first pushed through in 2021 as part of their $1.9 trillion pandemic aid bill, preventing a lapse at the end of the year.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The plan would raise most of its new tax revenue, an estimated $313 billion, by imposing a minimum tax on the so-called book income of large corporations, like Amazon and FedEx, that currently use tax credits and other maneuvers to reduce their tax rates below the 21 percent corporate income tax rate in the United States.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;It would raise another $14 billion by reducing a preferential tax treatment for income earned by venture capitalists and private equity firms, which has long been a goal of Democrats.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;It invests $30 billion in production tax credits for solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and critical minerals processing; $10 billion in tax credits to build clean technology manufacturing facilities; and $500 million to be used through the Defense Production Act for heat pumps and critical minerals processing.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The deal also includes a means-tested $7,500 tax credit to make new electric vehicles more affordable, and a $4,000 tax credit for used electric vehicles, according to a summary of the package. Both credits will be offered only to lower and middle-income consumers.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The measure also includes a methane fee that will start in 2025.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;Also included will be $60 billion to address the disproportionate burden of pollution on low-income communities and communities of color, $27 billion for a “green bank” aimed at delivering financial support to clean energy projects and $20 billion for programs that can cut emissions in the agriculture sector.

Relevant to our discussion yesterday about Trump and DeSantis, the bill also includes &#34;comprehensive permitting reform&#34; aimed at making building easier, though not a lot of details have been released so far and I haven&#39;t trawled the bill yet.

I&#39;m pretty into everything I see here at first glance, especially the provision allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and also the investments in electric vehicles and related clean energy technologies (as you might have guessed from my posts ranting about gas reliance always exposing us to international crises).  I see nothing about nuclear power in the summary unfortunately (edit: see u/ChrisPrattAlphaRaptr&#39;s comment for details on what they are doing).

I&#39;m a little surprised at some of the tax stuff - if we&#39;re going after paying back the deficit why focus on carried interest and not capital gains in general, one of Biden&#39;s original pledges?  Presumably lost in compromise I suppose.  I&#39;ve been unconvinced by the arguments that eliminating the capital gains tax will choke off investment since so much of venture capital is from already tax-exempt sources like pension funds, but possibly also they were worried about choking off investment at a time when fears of a recession are already growing.  Note that Manchin also put the kibosh on attempts from the coastal senators to raise the SALT cap, which I consider to be a plus.

Note  also that this bill isn&#39;t guaranteed; Kyrsten Sinema hasn&#39;t weighed in yet and we haven&#39;t actually heard from every other Democratic senator either.

This comes a day after the Senate passing an actually bipartisan (64-33) [industrial policy bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/senate-chips-china.html) aimed at countering China and in particular onshoring the semiconductor industry:

&amp;gt;The bill, a convergence of economic and national security policy, would provide $52 billion in subsidies and additional tax credits to companies that manufacture chips in the United States. It also would add $200 billion for scientific research, especially into artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing and a variety of other technologies.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The bill calls for pouring $10 billion into the Department of Commerce — which would also dole out the chips subsidies to companies that apply — to create 20 “regional technology hubs” across the country. The brainchild of Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, and Mr. Schumer, the hubs would aim to link together research universities with private industry in an effort to create Silicon Valley-like centers for technology innovation in areas hollowed out by globalization.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The legislation would steer billions to the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation to promote both basic research and research and development into advanced semiconductor manufacturing, as well as work force development programs, in an effort to build a labor pipeline for a slew of emerging industries.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;. . .  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The bill also seeks to create research and development and manufacturing jobs in the long run. It includes provisions aimed at building up pipelines of workers — through work force development grants and other programs — concentrated in once-booming industrial hubs hollowed out by corporate offshoring.

I haven&#39;t read nearly as much about this one but interested and heartned to see any piece of major legislation passed with such substantial cross-aisle cooperation.  Apologies for the bare bones analysis but I need to dig into both of these deeper to have much more to say.  Interested to hear what others think.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ii0b74z/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w9703v/wellness_wednesday_for_july_27_2022/ihzz0i8/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Any recommendations for a podcast?</title><updated>2022-07-28T15:08:42Z</updated><author><name>Anouleth</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">Any recommendations for a podcast?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w9703v/wellness_wednesday_for_july_27_2022/ihzz0i8/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihxe7kh/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] I saw this [Exclusive: Former Republicans and Democrats to form new third U.S. p</title><updated>2022-07-28T00:29:46Z</updated><author><name>greyenlightenment</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">I saw this [Exclusive: Former Republicans and Democrats to form new third U.S. political party](https://archive.ph/hCiRX#selection-435.0-442.0)

It&#39;s called the &#34;Forward party&#34; 

&amp;gt;The new party, called Forward, will initially be co-chaired by former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey. They hope the party will become a viable alternative to the Republican and Democratic parties that dominate U.S. politics, founding members told Reuters.

&amp;gt;The new party is being formed by a merger of three political groups that have emerged in recent years as a reaction to America&#39;s increasingly polarized and gridlocked political system. The leaders cited a Gallup poll last year showing a record two-thirds of Americans believe a third party is needed.

&amp;gt;The merger involves the Renew America Movement, formed in 2021 by dozens of former officials in the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Donald Trump; the Forward Party, founded by Yang, who left the Democratic Party in 2021 and became an independent; and the Serve America Movement, a group of Democrats, Republicans and independents founded by former Republican congressman David Jolly.

It looks like it&#39;s composed of disaffected democrats and never-Trump Bush-era holdouts and Trump turncoats. Does not seem promising.  

Regarding spoilers, this will hurt democrats more than republicans. From what I have gleaned on reddit and social media like Twitter, Yang has sorta become today&#39;s Ralph Nader...a leftist that democrats love to hate and who is perceived as being unhelpful despite his good intentions. It&#39;s like &#34;go away Yang..your moment is over&#34;</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihxe7kh/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w9703v/wellness_wednesday_for_july_27_2022/ihvm026/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] I’ve been reading some studies on alcohol.

I’m pretty sure our culture is drinking incorrectly. Alcohol has a significant *retrograde* enhancement on memory; it especially enhances positive-valence memory and (perhaps) social/language memory, but only post-learning.  I don’t think the mechanism is conclusive but the hypothesis is that it works by reducing memory interference on information presented post-ingestion. There is no benefit to drinking *before* learning on memory acquisition, there is only a benefit *after* learning on memory *consolidation*. Drinking before any learning will negatively influence acquisition and retention. Or so studies suggest.

This would mean that, if we are to drink, we ought to (1) not pre-game; (2) exposure ourselves to a context where we desire to create preferentially happy memories, (3) drink immediately following the context. If we are drinking to bond socially, we want the bonding to be before the drinking starts. If we are drinking with a book, we may want to start reading before we start drinking. It would also seem that if we have to do some annoying negative thing, alcohol will enable it to be done without much negative effect on mood when it is over.

It’s surprising to read historical accounts of writers and thinkers drinking so much. It’s likely that culture used to be oriented toward this more beneficial style of drinking. Think: drinking in ode of some emotionally-charged celebration (wedding, then after-party); drinking the wine *in memory* of Christ; etc.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w9703v/wellness_wednesday_for_july_27_2022/ihvm026/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w9703v/wellness_wednesday_for_july_27_2022/ihvigze/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep because I keep ruminating on things that</title><updated>2022-07-27T17:07:15Z</updated><author><name>sargon66</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep because I keep ruminating on things that don&#39;t much bother me during the day.

I&#39;ve never been a weightlifter, as my exercise has always been cardio of some form primarily (running, swimming, biking). I fell off the horse a little during and immediately after college, and getting married added a lot of things onto my plate that let me gain quite a bit of weight.

So, after a few months of kicking the can down the road, I finally got a gym membership a month ago and have been going consistently. I was prepared for the effects to take a while and I&#39;ve been slowly incrementing weight to where I&#39;m pushing 20 lb plates now. I have actually been mildly surprised at how quickly I have been dropping weight and building muscle. My stomach fat has declined somewhat, and my running pace to and from the gym has increased noticably to where I am running, not jogging, and it feels incredible.

I&#39;m still trying to manage my diet, as my and my wife&#39;s schedules give us a lot of excuses to take the easy route of not cooking. However, I&#39;m finding better alternatives to what I was eating and drinking and I&#39;m slowly building new eating habits. I don&#39;t have a scale to measure myself, but my activity, vitality, and attitude have been sky-high for the last month.

Ultimately my crazy goal is to train for a triathlon. I&#39;ve been gassing up some buddies for years and I finally am in a place where I can consistently work out. I have my sights set on a half ironman, as I trained for and failed to complete one years ago. My goal weight is a bit up in the air, but I want to hit 20%ish body fat before I start training hard again. Ideally, I&#39;m 5&#39;11&#34; so my guess is around 180-200, but I&#39;m not sure how muscle weight works into that.

I know there are some endurance guys in this community, as well as some fitness-focused people. I&#39;m kind of curious to gauge what the community might think about a collective fitness challenge. Something like a &#34;complete a tri&#34; or &#34;complete a half marathon&#34; with some sort of meet-up for a race somewhere. Let me know if there is interest in something like that and I can brainstorm some ideas to follow up with. I&#39;m going to aim to do races anyway, but getting some sort of community to aim with is something I haven&#39;t really done before, and it would be a cool challenge.

He talked in great detail about inefficiencies in the federal permitting process - applications being evaluated sequentially instead of in parallel, regulators dragging their feet with delays, no centralized dashboard to figure out where you are in the process.

Unlike most of his speeches, this one fit [Scott&#39;s early characterization of Trump](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/19/book-review-the-art-of-the-deal/): &#34;the effect was that of an infodump from an autistic child with a special interest in real estate development.&#34;

Shortly after saying that, a bunch of reporters ignored the speech he gave and started asking him about racism.

About a year ago, Ron DeSantis passed [HB 1059](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/1059) and no one seems to be talking about it. HB 1059 is important. Things it does:

* Localities have 30 days to respond to your housing permit application. Exceeding 30 days means they have to refund 10% of your application fee per day. (This is single family homes, rules and time periods are a bit different for bigger projects.)
* If your application is declared incomplete, and you make it complete, localities have 10 days to approve/reject. If the city takes 11 days, that&#39;s another 20% off the permit fee.
* Cities must post the entire process on an online dashboard for tracking.
* Counties must post a list of all required attachments, drawings, or other requirements for each type of application, on its website, as well as explicitly outline the procedures for approval/denial. (This makes it very easy to both a) submit a valid application and b) sue if the county denies improperly.)

As per an [analysis in the WaPo](https://archive.ph/aXfCK), it&#39;s working. Permit processing rates (in 30 days) have gone from 47% to 80%, 100% in some places. This is enabling a lot more housing permits.

At this point, it seems that to very little fanfare, Ron DeSantis has become a great champion of YIMBY.

Wall Street ha</title><updated>2022-07-26T13:38:24Z</updated><author><name>FiveHourMarathon</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">**Has Modern Capitalism Lost Track of the Idea of the Gimmick?**

Wall Street had a day of talking about nothing but [Snapchat](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/054b5080-cb67-3e13-8265-dab2917f384a/snap-stock-tumbles-as.html) as its parent company lost 30% of its value after a bad earnings report. Advertising revenues are down across the board, as Apple and others have instituted better privacy protections for users, and the economy seems headed for a general downturn so ad revenues will likely follow.

[Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.) for those of you that aren&#39;t aware, is a messaging app that send self-destructing picture/video and sometimes text messages. When it launched, it was the first service to really make the disappearing pic/video big, and that made it popular with teenagers/20-somethings who wanted to send pictures that they might be embarrassed by later. Besides the obvious sexting use-case (the privacy was of course much worse than promised), I also recall having a lot of male friends that loved to send me pictures of their giant poops as a gag, and people liked to use it at parties to send drunken videos that wouldn&#39;t last any longer than necessary. Its use was always casual, no one wrote a thesis on Snapchat the way they have on Twitter/Reddit or made art on it the way they have on Instagram/TikTok. Its primary use case was dicking around with your friends, and the professional ecosystem built around that because people were already on snapchat, at core it&#39;s a [Gimmick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimmick).

Somehow this got turned into a market cap of over $100,000,000,000; 80% of which has been erased this year. The company has only once turned an actual profit, and while the founders are now immensely wealthy it is as a result of selling equity in the &#34;future&#34; of Snapchat rather than from money actually paid by advertisers or users of Snapchat. Somebody is going to, or already has, lost a lot of money on this.

And it&#39;s summer, so I&#39;m thinking of summer trips to the Jersey Shore as a kid, and the Surf Mall on the boardwalk that was like a big pseudo-department store with every summer fad or gimmick of the year. I think I&#39;ve been inside it most years since about 1998 or so, and every year the majority of their entire stock of stuff is different. One year it&#39;s drug rug hoodies, the next year it is marvel themed sweatshirts, the next everything is in a certain shade of pink. Baseball cards become Pokemon cards become YuGiOh cards become Funko Pops (I think? I&#39;m still not entirely sure what those are beyond hearing them in sneers) comes all the way back around to first edition Holo Charizard Pokemon Cards. 

And I&#39;m thinking about it, the Surf Mall proprietors if you asked them would say they need to make money on whatever they are selling before it goes out of fashion, and run their business each year at a profit on that item. And their suppliers would say, we&#39;re selling these sweatshirts at a price where we can make money this year before they go out of fashion next year and then we&#39;ll make something else, whether they are manufactured in NJ or in Sichuan they are able to figure out what their customer will move to. I feel like that&#39;s what we&#39;ve lost in this business environment, you get a gimmick you and recognize it and you cash in while you can, then move on. Snapchat was a gimmick, it was always a gimmick, and anyone who knew teenagers using it would have said &#34;Yeah, this is a gimmick.&#34; A business like that should have been trying to actually make money off its business while the going was good. What is it that leads to this attitude:

1) Is it that everyone is trying to get the next Amazon or Google? Are all these investors just foolishly playing the lottery? Are they all lemmings following a few leaders on CNBC or whatever who fell for the lottery approach?

2) On a related note, cult of the founder? Snapchat&#39;s founding pair will always control 98% of voting shares, much like WeWork before them, were investors snookered by a few charismatic guys?

3) Generation gap expanding? Maybe middle aged businessmen get physical fads like Pokemon cards because they saw similar things when they were teens, but digital fads confuse them because they didn&#39;t experience them. This should become less true over time, as digital generations age, but it does not seem to be. It would have been obvious, in my mind, to any 19 year old sexting on Snap that Snap was not a $100bn company for the future, it was a fun thing you would stop doing soon enough. There&#39;s a disconnect between the customer and the investor somewhere.

4) Cult of the future? I&#39;m probably more plugged into fashion than most Motte-izens, and you see this as well in fashion companies where brands are constantly decried for not keeping up with the times, or alternatively for selling out when they get big, when the reasonable explanation for the vast majority of brands is that they&#39;re big for a while and then they disappear. Most apps are the same, they&#39;re a fad for a bit, then they fail. Why are we so consistently expecting top 1% scenarios from every business, rather than looking for 50th percentile performance?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihpow7l/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihnvjn6/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] A while ago their was a Motte Survey that had the statement &#34;the west is in Decl</title><updated>2022-07-26T02:15:24Z</updated><author><name>ussgordoncaptain2</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">A while ago their was a Motte Survey that had the statement &#34;the west is in Decline&#34; which I disagreed with but the modal motte user agreed with.

Therefore I need to tease out what people meant by &#34;the west&#34; and meant by &#34;decline&#34;.

Survey&#39;s are popular so I [made 1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbtLqP8cf6ae4C3JeRXXXXNpCBlVF28B9QuDshf9oswPBHXg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Most of the questions are replicated below.

1. What G20 nations are in &#34;The west&#34; (most notable countries, being Russia, Japan, and South Korea) 

2. What countries are in Decline? 

3. What do people mean when they say &#34;Decline&#34;? Do they mean relative decline or absolute decline?
        
       3a. A country loses her imperial holdings but the mainland grew 5x in the time period, did they &#34;decline&#34;

       3b. A global power grows 5 fold with stable borders but the rest of the world grew 10 fold, did they &#34;decline&#34;  
        3c. A country grows 5 fold in 30 years becoming one of the major powers, but then in the next 30 years grows only 1.5x and falls from 1/3rd as strong to being 2/9ths as strong as the main superpower.


When people say the west is in decline I tend to disagree, with the exception of the fall of the British and French empires, The west has not declined, merely risen slower than contemporaries. Even then since the fall of the berlin wall only 1 nation (china) has risen to surpass the Medium powers of Germany/France/Britan. Though Japan surpassed them as well, Japan also became &#34;west&#34; somehow.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihnvjn6/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihmd0bz/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Reposting my link to a survey.

I didn&#39;t get any responses from The Motte users (I got some from the other two subs) so I&#39;m posting it here, I think the CW thread might get all the traffic as opposed to the front page. 

Recently there was a post trying to survey the general knowledge of the motte. The post got removed. And various people accused the survey of having various shortcomings, from it being a troll, to OP having some kind of agenda with the questions asked. 

Therefore I created a new survey for general knowledge. 

~~1. Its timed. There are 39 questions. With 35 minutes to answer all of them.~~ 

~~2. They are all multiple choice, with only 1 valid answer.~~

There is a math, CS, geography, history and economics section.

I tried to design the questions such that they can be answered without any niche/esoteric knowledge. I did not include any of my personal pet questions or anything like that and tried to frame the questions such that you can use incomplete knowledge to answer them, as long as you have a rough idea of the mechanisms that guide those fields. 

Feedback appreciated. 

DISCLAIMER: Email only to log in, I can&#39;t see the emails.

edit - Very controversial. I will count more than one answer to the *vague* questions as correct when I do the final eda. My ultimate goal is to do a subreddit wide survey, not individual survey, so don&#39;t put too much weight into your own score. Add +1 or 2 points because some questions are vague, if you want a rough estimate of your score were the questions less vague.

edit2- Certain questions most people were getting wrong, people are getting right now. Either there is data leakage from the comments, or a different demographic is onto it.

I thought I&#39;d share some thoughts on it.

There is a technique that old SysAdmins will recognize called tarpitting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpit_(networking)#SMTP_tarpits

The technique is to prevent spammers from being able to abuse a mail server (send too many messages) by simply wasting their time.  If the mail system detects something it believes is a spammer, it will simply make everything take a really long (relatively) time.

Instead of being able to send 1000 messages/second, it might limit you to one message ever 5 seconds (this is exaggerated).  The idea is that a normal user won&#39;t notice this, but a spammer trying to send thousands of messages will.  It&#39;s a very clever, and also effective strategy.  I like it.

There is something that I&#39;ve noticed especially on reddit, which feels like an evolution of Gish Galloping: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop

The way it might go is that an uncharitable discussion partner will write long posts with very little substance in which they repeatedly ask the same questions, or sortof &#34;play dumb&#34; and ask for explanations for things which have been discussed *extensively* in the past.

I notice it here, but I notice it on other subreddits as well.  To put on a tinfoil hat for a short second: a lot of times the accounts which engage in this behavior seem to spend an almost *unbelievable* amount of time posting things on reddit, and often only on one subreddit.  So my tinfoil hat question is: are these really good GPT bots?  GPT-3 is *quite* good, and it seems within the realm of possibility that there are conversational-tarpitting bots that exist.

My question is: has anybody else noticed this behavior and charted it at all?  If so how do you identify it and what framework do you use for thinking about it?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihlhqm0/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihle362/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Anybody else been seeing a significant ramp-up in spam emails getting past Gmail</title><updated>2022-07-25T16:14:19Z</updated><author><name>ItsAPomeloParty</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Anybody else been seeing a significant ramp-up in spam emails getting past Gmail&#39;s spam filter?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihle362/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihl4atv/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] *Apologies for posting multiple times at once.

After looking on the internet, I found that the differences account for context to be already present.

One of the sub-questions I was curious about was why oil companies weren’t investing more in digging new wells.  A few commenters replied that this was probably because of Biden – he opened up his term by cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline, removing permits on drilling on federal lands and saying we should move towards fully green energy.  My reply was that Obama basically did all that stuff too and oil production doubled under him, so are these kinds of regulatory policy moves really that important to investors?

Users u/LeninLovedUncleTom and u/Pulpachair offered more information on how technology breakthroughs and the relatively high price of crude oil opened up the new shale market under Obama and led to that crazy growth.  But there’s still a lot of shale and crude prices are crazy high again and no one’s drilling.  I think [both](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/comment/ih8bt2a/?context=3) [users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/comment/ih89f6l/?context=3) made compelling arguments (if i followed them), substantiated with the articles I can find with quotes from oil leaders, that the primary driver of investment isn&#39;t really regulatory policy, it&#39;s the fact that everyone is too worried about massive market fluctuations.  OPEC cratered prices after the initial shale boom and hurt a lot of investors, and Covid saw barrels going for negative prices.  Who wants to invest in drilling more when the market could switch up on you and completely destroy your profits?  [To quote](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-18/shale-wildcatters-send-bullish-oil-price-signal-with-output-restraint):

&amp;gt;“Whether it’s $150 oil, $200 oil, or $100 oil, we’re not going to change our growth plans,’’ Pioneer Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield said during a Bloomberg Television interview. “If the president wants us to grow, I just don’t think the industry can grow anyway.’’

I think here this offers us two possibilities, with two questions I’d ask everyone.

1:  If we assume government policy can’t make a huge difference on oil investment relative to the market, and the market experiences such dramatic fluctuations that investors literally won’t invest in drilling more even when it would be profitable, and that this common sense market rationale means we all have to eat high gas prices: is this not an extremely strong argument for trying to divest away from oil?  To invest full scale in nuclear and renewables (edit: and battery storage technology) and microgrids and the infrastructure to make electric vehicles possible and widespread?

Much is talked about the intermittency issues with renewables, but should the fact that Russia and China each control 15% of the world’s oil production, and petroleum sales can always be used as a carrot or stick in conflicts like the current one, and that we don’t have the ability to control OPEC with their further 44% of the world’s production – shouldn’t all this be seen functionally as an broad scale intermittency problem as well?  You can address shortfalls with wind and solar in a number of ways, like using combined heat and gas systems or only using them to complement nuclear power, but in crisis situations where 15% of the world’s oil disappears off of the western markets there doesn’t seem to be any quick fix – our oil companies outright say the won’t drill more no matter what the president does!

I’m well aware this would be a cost intensive and technologically challenging road, and that renewables in particular have other huge limitations and could perhaps never fully fill the gap fossil fuels played, but wouldn’t shrinking our fossil fuel dependency alone go significantly far towards reducing our exposure to these kinds of crises?  Would the eventual problems we might face in a country that invested to the hilt in electric cars, nuclear energy, renewable energy systems and decentralized microgrids be worse than what we’re dealing with now?  Would it be worse than the fact that our country is always vulnerable having the pipe turned off from the outside?

2:  Alternatively, maybe none of the obvious stuff Biden could do would help oil.  But let’s pretend he can - what if he did all the non-obvious stuff as well?  What if Biden completely deregulated oil, cut their taxes down to zero, gave them (more) massive subsidies and promised to insure any losses from market fluctuations, slashed wages, cut all zoning laws, worker’s rights, safety regulations and environmental regulations and finally got domestic oil production to rise.

Would it be worth it?

Sometimes I’m jealous of China’s powerful industrial base.  Then I think about their horrendously polluted waterways and their skies full of smog and their workers paid pittances to labor for crazy hours in often unsafe conditions, and I wonder if it would be worth having to do all that to compete with them on some kind of even footing.

Would it be worth producing two, three, four times as much oil, enough that we have dominance over the world price and never have to worry about this situation again, if we also had to trade away our centuries of hard-fought worker’s rights? If all of our gorgeous national parks were studded with oil wells and refineries and our waterways and skies groaned under the weight of their pollution?  This is an exaggerated example to be sure, but in a world where oil executives outright say the President’s normal policy levers won’t change their investment outlook, it bears worth asking: how much are we actually willing to give up to change that?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihkqcw6/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihhgg4l/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] So, what are you reading?

Most specifically, I am interested in the reasonableness (for lack of a better word) of the actions.  Extrajudicial violence is, in and of itself, somewhat unreasonable a priori, but how many victims were random citizens taken off the street, and how many were communally killed before the legal system would have (likely) found them guilty of the alleged crimes?  Is there any accounting of this?  Is looking for as much frivolous?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihgvakg/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihgexto/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] iTunes broke my Windows 10 laptop.

Before installing iTunes on my HP laptop with Core i5 7th Gen Intel, I could watch fullscreen video without judder, I could have dozens of tabs open simultaneously, I could play video games.

Then I installed iTunes for a work project. Fullscreen video runs at one frame per second, and embedded videos almost as slowly. Even two tabs on Firefox makes it nearly impossible to move my mouse cursor, which moves, freezes, and then reappears halfway across screen.

Now, even after uninstalling iTunes (and its associated tools) and a day later reinstalling my Intel onboard graphics driver, the problems remain. Since I can&#39;t afford a new computer, I&#39;m stuck with this one for now, and I&#39;ll need to use it next weekend to run an RPG, so the clock is ticking. Any suggestions?

EDIT: SOLVED. No more replies plz. Thanks for all the help! Apparently it&#39;s a known problem with Win10, usually drivers, and it&#39;s been solved by people doing things as wacky as disabling their DVD drive or uninstalling their mouse.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihgexto/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihgdg5n/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Where can I find stats on how many IVF babies have been born each year going bac</title><updated>2022-07-24T14:54:04Z</updated><author><name>MacaqueOfTheNorth</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Where can I find stats on how many IVF babies have been born each year going back to the 70s?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihgdg5n/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihg1ec7/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Are there any major image/media search/collection websites that are not Pinteres</title><updated>2022-07-24T13:22:38Z</updated><author><name>Difficult_Ad_3879</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Are there any major image/media search/collection websites that are not Pinterest/Tumblr?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihg1ec7/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihg15n2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Is there any value to thirst-fasting, eg going x hours of your day without hydra</title><updated>2022-07-24T13:20:32Z</updated><author><name>Difficult_Ad_3879</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Is there any value to thirst-fasting, eg going x hours of your day without hydration? It would seem to fall in line with other kinds of “fasting” that have health benefits (caloric fasting, sleep restriction to increase sleep efficiency). The closest I could find is a study where *not* hydrating *within* an exercise session (but a little after) led to increased cardiovascular gains. My intuition is that there is probably some health benefit to ~8 hours of the day refraining from hydration, followed by over-hydration.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihg15n2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihfxd76/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] What&#39;s the most right-wing quote from a work of fiction you can think of?

I didn&#39;t get to look at the questions, so I can&#39;t vouch for that.

I am thinking of making an actual general knowledge survey with sections on math, physics, biology, geogpraphy,economics and CS.

I plan to only include multiple choice questions that are straight forward and can be answered using intuition alone, no esoteric knowledge or trap questions. 

Any suggestions on other topics? Or how to frame the questions?

I might cross post to a lot of different subreddits and compile the results of each subreddit at the end.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w524ad/friday_fun_thread_for_july_22_2022/ihekf5a/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w524ad/friday_fun_thread_for_july_22_2022/ihcj6ub/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] I take back everything I said about the LOTR TV series\*.

It is a brilliant record; I think it&#39;s one of the crowning jewels of the genre both musically and in lyrical poetry.

It&#39;s a concept album, tracing the journey of the energy of a photon of light. Each song is its own self-contained story, starting with the entrance of this bit of energy into a life and ending with the extinguishing of that life&#39;s light and the energy&#39;s departure. It starts in the fusion forges of the sun, in [An Ember&#39;s Arc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyuDOVm8TG4):

&amp;gt; This cascade of embers,

&amp;gt; Fused into a star&#39;s ignition

&amp;gt; A crucible for their collapse,

&amp;gt; Seething crux of its ambition

&amp;gt; ---

&amp;gt; The axiom of this expanse,

&amp;gt; Unrelenting pressure

&amp;gt; Every moment, in each place,

&amp;gt; Collisions beyond measure

&amp;gt; ---

&amp;gt; An ordinary pair that met,

&amp;gt; Whilst merging into one,

&amp;gt; Heaved and spat a mote of light,

&amp;gt; Adrift within the Sun

and it ends in the funeral pyre of a man in [The Smoke of Many Fires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARI0XyTiips):

&amp;gt; Like billions before him regardless of form

&amp;gt; It ended as chance had decided

&amp;gt; So briefly contained an inferno&#39;s refrain

&amp;gt; Having powered and angered and guided

&amp;gt; ---

&amp;gt; At the heart of the blaze awareness dissolved

&amp;gt; Light ascended devoid of desire

&amp;gt; From a trail intertwined life and death strewn behind

&amp;gt; To the stars it returned from the fire</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w524ad/friday_fun_thread_for_july_22_2022/ih8alu4/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w524ad/friday_fun_thread_for_july_22_2022/ih7phca/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] What’s the simplest, most barebones game you can think of?

This was partly designed as a bonding experience with my dad and partly because it feels to me like the liberation of France is arguably Western democracy’s finest hour.

In short, I’d recommend the trip. A number of the sites are extremely high quality and clearly received considerable investment from the US government. I almost skipped it, but I’m glad I stopped at the [cemetery at Omaha beach ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_American_Cemetery_and_Memorial). The grounds are beautiful, and I found the experience of seeing the graves of so many young men surprisingly moving.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w524ad/friday_fun_thread_for_july_22_2022/ih5t22k/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
