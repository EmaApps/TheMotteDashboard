Lately, u/ilforte  has been banging the drum of [paraphrasing] &#34;worrying about alignment too much at the expense of a high-freedom future is terrible, Yud is deeply paranoid which colors everything else he writes about, etc.&#34; &#34;Here is some suggestive evidence that Ilforte is mistaken on AGI Doom being a fringe/LW-only/Yud!/etc. idea:

1. DeepMind&#39;s alignment team [engaging](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qJgz2YapqpFEDTLKn/deepmind-alignment-team-opinions-on-agi-ruin-arguments) with Yud&#39;s List of Lethalities post. I don&#39;t detect much sneering, mostly specific disagreements with specific things.  

2. Sam Altman (OpenAI) re-tweeting that list of lethalities post (would link but short on time rn, easily found if you scroll back far enough)

3. Stability AI (of Stable Diffusion fame) is related to EleutherAI in some capacity. There&#39;s definitely a lot of personnel overlap. Emad (head of Stability AI, someone Ilforte has spoken very fondly of) has retweeted various LW posts ([1)](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1563715319566409729) and has [retweeted this job ad](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1512405527350943746) from Conjecture, the Alignment focused spin-off of EleutherAI, founded by Connor Leahy, seems to have alignment takes that are not far from Yud&#39;s, as you can tell if you either watch his interview on a [recent podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz4G9zrlAGs&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheInsideView) or simply read his feed. 

note: These are three differnet organizations, all with relatively diverse views on AI, especially Stability AI vs the others. 


**What is the point of this post?**

Ilforte is an extremely eloquent writer. He is probably the most talented (certainly the most compelling! though IMO his prose is often far from lucid...) prose writer currently active on /themotte. And yet he seems to have a completely evidence-free view on the possible danger of AGI, has a deeply suspicious view of Yud, who, for all of his many flaws, is so bad at hiding his own views that he spends all of his weirdness points debating PR-toxic topics like baby qualia-- (you can accuse Yud of a few things, but a talented dissassembler for the sake of other goals he definitely is not...)

Ilforte seems to have decided to direct all of his immense verbal talent to deriding pessimistic takes on AGI, and I think this bad. I think a redteaming of paranoid takes on AI is great, but Ilforte has often made his arguments mostly through suspicion of AI-suspicious people.

I think its time someone pointed at this argument directly and engaged with it. I&#39;m not that person, unfortunately, because I&#39;m drowning in work rn, but I&#39;m planting a flag here and hoping Ilforte and others can debate productively about ways that [suspicious of AGI] and [suspicious of those who are suspicious of AGI] can productively disagree and understand the world better.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imgofrm/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/imgeml1/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Reposting my question from the last thread to see if it just needed more visibil</title><updated>2022-08-30T23:43:29Z</updated><author><name>DrManhattan16</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Reposting my question from the last thread to see if it just needed more visibility.

So, I&#39;ve got a burning question about the whole &#34;Money corrupts politics?&#34; debate. It seems like whenever someone says it does, the response is to point to studies looking at whether it can change who the person in power. These studies point to the answer being no.

My question, then, is whether anyone has looked at this from the perspective of a politician?

1. Politicians want to have more votes and more money to run their campaigns. Having someone drop out of supporting you is something they should be sensitive to. Politicians may weigh their incentives and goals if two or more contradict, but I don&#39;t think any politician declares a level of support beyond which they will not allow any donations/support to change their policy goals.

2. Politicians may believe that campaign spending does affect the outcome of an election, so they act as if it does and strive to not lose large donators.

Now, these are just hypothesis, so I&#39;m looking to see if there are any studies testing them for validity.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/imgeml1/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imgejsp/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] **There&#39;s Still a TJ Test, Actually**

The [Thomas Jefferson High School for Sci</title><updated>2022-08-30T23:42:55Z</updated><author><name>DinoInNameOnly</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">**There&#39;s Still a TJ Test, Actually**

The [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology) is a magnet STEM-focused high school in Northern Virginia established in 1985. The school has special facilities meant to provide opportunities for students who show achievement and passion for STEM and who will eventually pursue careers in science, engineering, or medicine. It has courses in things like artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics, DNA science, and machine learning. It also has several labs where students can do research projects. It was [ranked](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/virginia/districts/fairfax-county-public-schools/thomas-jefferson-high-school-for-science-and-technology-20461) as the best school in the country in 2022. 

Until recently, TJ admitted students through a competitive process similar to the college admissions process in which prior academic achievement, teacher recommendations, and an exam similar to the SAT played a major role. The school had a low proportion of black and Hispanic students who were admitted, and this was long a complaint of left-wing activists who advocate reforms to the admissions process so that more non-Asian minorities would be admitted. In particular, they blamed the admissions exam for eliminating most such students from consideration.

In 2020, those activists got their way. The school board voted to eliminate the admissions test in [October 2020](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/thomas-jefferson-high-admissions-change/2020/10/07/0a1f8faa-08a7-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html) and later that year made other reforms to the admissions process, including setting minimum quotas for admission at the middle school level and adding &#34;experience factors&#34; to the process. The [class of students](https://www.fcps.edu/news/tjhsst-offers-admission-550-students-broadens-access-students-who-have-aptitude-stem) admitted the next year went from being 4.52% black and Hispanic to 18.36%. 

An advocacy group opposed to the 2020 changes [sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_for_TJ_v._Fairfax_County_School_Board), alleging the changes discriminated against Asian Americans, whose share of admitted students decreased from 73.05% to 54.36%. The case is currently pending before the appeals court.

One thing I realized while I was researching this is that there actually still is a test that influences your probability of admission to TJ. One of the &#34;experience factors&#34; that increases a student&#39;s odds of being admitted in the [new admissions process](https://www.fcps.edu/registration/thomas-jefferson-high-school-science-and-technology-admissions/tjhsst-freshman) is whether they are an English Language Learner (ELL). An [ELL is a student](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/explaining-ell-status-english.pdf) who has extra support learning English in school. How do schools identify which students need extra support learning English?

Well, there&#39;s a test. Schools administer an English skills test and students who perform poorly on it are identified as ELL and offered extra instruction in special classes for ELLs. 

What this means for TJ is that a student&#39;s chance of being admitted to an elite school for the academically excellent is *increased* if they perform *poorly* enough on evaluations of their language skills.

The reason the school board added this consideration is obvious: The [large majority (78%)](https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/el-characteristics/index.html#four) of ELLs are Hispanic, so preferring ELLs in the admissions process is a way to increase the proportion of Hispanics admitted without needing to add race to the admissions process explicitly (which would be more easily challenged legally). Asians make up 11% of ELLs too, but it&#39;s notable that Hispanics outnumber Asians among ELLs by 7:1 but only by about 3:1 in the general population ([6.1% vs. 18.9%](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045221)). A lot of Asian kids speak two languages but their parents made sure they were good enough with English that they don&#39;t need any special instruction.

This is just... so backwards. I don&#39;t think it would be fair to prefer students who speak more than one language in admission to TJ. But I could see an argument for it: Students who successfully learned a second language and succeeded enough to be equally or almost equally academically impressive as students who speak English natively have done something really impressive, now that they&#39;ve mastered the lingua franca, they&#39;ll probably shine even brighter. In fact, this describes a large proportion of the students admitted to TJ under the old process. But that&#39;s not what they&#39;re doing with this new process. They&#39;re specifically preferring the students who were *least* successful at learning the new language, the ones who struggled the *most* with it. 

On top of that, immigrant families who were responsible and ~~paid off their student loans~~ taught their kids English fluency and saved the taxpayer-funded school system the extra burden of dealing with kids who don&#39;t know English are punished, while the ones who depended on the government for that are rewarded.

Well, expect an increase in enrollment in ELL programs in Fairfax County of kids who seem to be speak pretty good English most of the time.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imgejsp/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imfp7ja/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] **Is data truth?**

Since I owed a reply to /u/Im_not_JB here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/comment/ilvutba/

I&#39;m gonna try and figure out where we are with WikiLeaks.

Wikileaks has come from the perspective that information wants to be free, that leaks hold people accountable, and that releasing all available data is the best way to do so.

I think that this came from the same place of Aaron Schwartz, Jimbo Whales techno-utopian anti-state idealism that was in the air around the mid to late aughts. Compare the [Declaration Of Independence Of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence).

We now live in that world, where it&#39;s easy to disseminate vast dumps of data. It&#39;s available to anyone. But now that we have it, I wonder if it&#39;s really the best approach. Because what we end up getting is just data. It doesn&#39;t come with the tools to analyze it, and in the absence of analysts by competent folks, we get The Internet doing its own sleuthing. From misidentifying the Boston Bomber to pizzagate, I can think of examples of information overload harming rather than helping.

And that makes me lean back towards the journalistic approach of combining data with analysis and responsibility. I can think of plenty of hard hitting stories like the Panama papers that _did_ work out.

I think the profession of journalism won. I don&#39;t think it can or should be replaced by blindly dumping any data you can get your hands on and calling it journalism.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imfp7ja/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/ime67pd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] What problems do you think are AGI-complete?</title><updated>2022-08-30T14:54:05Z</updated><author><name>Primaprimaprima</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">What problems do you think are AGI-complete?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/ime67pd/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/ime3y6y/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] News from an old corner of the culture war: Oberlin is [denied an appeal](https:</title><updated>2022-08-30T14:38:58Z</updated><author><name>roolb</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">News from an old corner of the culture war: Oberlin is [denied an appeal](https://legalinsurrection.com/2022/08/gibsons-bakery-wins-ohio-supreme-court-refuses-to-hear-oberlin-college-appeal/) to the Ohio Supreme Court in its loss to Gibson&#39;s Bakery.

This week, the New York Times published [Why Student Debt Relief Isn’t Elitist](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/29/opinion/student-debt-relief.html) by Paul Krugman and [Why I Changed My Mind on Student Debt Forgiveness](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/30/opinion/student-loan-debt-relief-biden.html) (by Susan Dynarski, a Harvard economist). Krugman&#39;s mostly calling out Republican hypocrisy in one form or another (fine as far as it goes), but the substantive part follows:

&amp;gt;The Biden administration says that its plan will provide relief to as many as 43 million Americans. That’s a lot of people, not a small, cosseted elite.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;even if you subscribe to the Trump diner theory of politics — according to which the only voters who matter are blue-collar guys wearing baseball caps — you should be aware that some of those guys probably took out loans to attend trade schools or community colleges, all too often getting nothing but debt in return. Even among those who didn’t take out student loans, many probably have children, siblings, cousins or friends who did. So the Biden plan will touch many people.

Dynarski&#39;s article focuses on the borrowers hardest hit.

&amp;gt;Defaults and financial distress are concentrated among the millions of students who drop out without a degree. The financial prospects for college dropouts are poor; they earn little more than do workers with no college education ...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;And dropout is not at all rare. A bit less than half of college students don’t earn a bachelor’s degree. Some people earn a shorter, two-year associate degree. But more than a quarter of those who start college hoping to earn a degree drop out with no credential.

If we take those articles at face value \[0\], we&#39;re talking about a program that provides relief to about 13 million Americans that fit a very sympathetic profile and badly need it - and a bonanza for another 30 million people, most of whom do not need that relief. \[1\]

**Would Anyone Support Country Club Loan Relief?**

Let&#39;s pretend for a moment that a Republican administration instituted a program subsidizing country club membership. After all, a lot of businesses are built and supported by the informal networks around country clubs, plus people that belong to country clubs tend to be successful.

So picture that: 60-70% of the borrowers do pretty well for themselves. Their businesses improv and they get richer. However, a substantial minority of the loan recipients don&#39;t have access to high-quality country clubs with their impressive facilities and wealthy cohorts. 30-40% take out loans to join municipal clubs or some strange off-brand variation called into being by the amount of money pumped into the system. The people do not flourish, their businesses do not succeed.

I don&#39;t think many people would stand for a country club relief program for both groups, and I don&#39;t think the New York Times would publish multiple defenses of the program in the space of a week.

This comparison might not sound fair, especially if you went to community college or commuter school (to say nothing of a for-profit college), but I promise it is directionally accurate.\[2\]

At liberal arts colleges, most private universities, and flagship state schools (at least), you get unbelievable amenities for your money. It&#39;s not just the oft-ridiculed climbing walls and lazy rivers - I&#39;m talking about the basics, the features of college that predate the crazy expansion of the last thirty (?) years: access to first-rate facilities, people paid to serve you, people paid to do your dishes, and on top of all that, excellent event programming so that, if your studies ever bore you, you&#39;ll still be stimulated.

Ultimately, I&#39;m shocked that so many early reactions to this involve a shrug, or (worse) approval of the policy, seemingly based on the sympathetic profile of a minority of beneficiaries, though maybe that&#39;s my naivete. Another writer here (responding to Trace&#39;s post, I think) wrote convincingly that people probably just conceive of this as &#34;free college&#34; rather than debt. That&#39;s an idea that&#39;s probably more popular than &#34;free country clubs&#34; (and definitely more popular than &#34;free country clubs for the rich&#34;), but I&#39;m not sure it deserves the support.

\[0\] People that have some college but no degree already do moderately better than people with a high-school diploma, [per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm), or [this Northeastern University study](https://www.northeastern.edu/bachelors-completion/news/average-salary-by-education-level), or any of the dozens of links that pop up when you start to research education and income.

\[1\] &#34;More than a quarter&#34; = 30% \* Krugman&#39;s &#34;43 million Americans&#34;, then round it up.

\[2\] Of course, there the educational experience. But I must say, this is easy to overstate, especially if you&#39;ve been [Fred-pilled](https://substack.com/profile/12666725-freddie-deboer).</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/ime085j/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/imdah89/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Does anyone have a good theory about why antivaxxers are anti**vaxxers**, specif</title><updated>2022-08-30T10:22:40Z</updated><author><name>zfinder</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Does anyone have a good theory about why antivaxxers are anti**vaxxers**, specifically?

She&#39;s clearly coming from a woke perspective — &#34;I only date people on the left; I guess that makes me &#39;rightphobic&#39;, but I&#39;m okay with that,&#34; lol. But she&#39;s also far more nuanced than your typical Twitter SJW (is there a less-dated noun for That Type? anyway)

Some notable excerpts, emphasis added by me:

&amp;gt; **A society that rejects transgender people’s bodies as valid is also one that deeply fetishizes them.** As a trans woman, most of the men I’d describe as “chasers” are men who get off on the social taboo of sleeping with transgender women and the fact that no one knows what they’re doing. Partially because they’re ashamed, but also because the secret excites them. Their secrecy also maintains their chances with cis women, who tend to be their preference. These men know that a lot of cis women would be repulsed if they knew they were attracted to transgender women, and this is the excuse they give for treating trans women how they do. Unfortunately, most chasers are in the position they’re in because they saw a trans woman who challenged their understanding of self, and they slowly but surely developed the habit of secretly consuming transgender pornography and contacting transgender women. They were curious, but then they learned they can prey on a group of people who are so used to not being preferred that they are often willing to go the extra mile to satisfy those who have privilege over them. **In fact, because transgender women know that they are rarely preferred over cis women, the attention of cis men is very validating to transgender women who are in an insecure phase of life. It’s not uncommon for transgender women to feel flattered by the affection of a man who identifies as heterosexual because, to them the expression of attraction is also a validation of them as women.** So, you have a group of heterosexual men who might otherwise be unimpressive whose inherent quality is now seen as impressive long before anything else is established. Some men become intoxicated by the idea that all they have to do is say they’re straight and gorgeous transgender women, who haven’t quite found their worth, will overlook all of their flaws, all of the reasons other women have rejected them all to feel more proximity to their privilege. This often leads to some very toxic and abusive dynamics that are very stressful for transgender women. **These men are actively attracted to them and choose to mistreat them because they are transgender. For me, that will always feel more transphobic than someone simply saying no to me.**

---

&amp;gt; Who men tend to prefer becomes very obvious when you are polyamorous. **I’ve dated men of various racial backgrounds who all denied they had a preference but were often primary partnered to cis white women. If they weren’t when I met them, almost all of them left or paused their relationships with me because of a new, cis white partner.** Removing monogamy from the conversation, allows for these things to be seen more clearly because a monogamous person could easily argue that it’s a coincidence that they just so happened to fall in love with someone who fits the idealized beauty standard. When you live in a very diverse city and all of your partners are that idealized beauty standard, it’s obvious you have a preference; but these people will deny it. **If you went to a Polyamory social and lined up every woman who was primary partnered, most of them will be cis and white; that’s not a coincidence. You’ll notice the “secondary” partners tend to be a bit darker skinned, often more queer, sometimes less cis than their primary. Often times, men primary their “preference” and keep their curiosities or the less socially acceptable partners as secondaries. To this day, I have never met a cis man primary partnered to a transgender woman with a cis woman as a secondary, but I have been the transgender secondary partner for many polyamorous men in LA.** If you were to ask these men if they had a preference, they would absolutely say no, but you see their preferences clear as day and you notice how when new women of color come to the event, they don’t get swarmed with attention the same way a white girl would. None of these socially aware, left leaning people want to say that they have a preference, but they do. But being a bit graceful, another aspect of “preference” that isn’t often discussed is that sometimes their “preference” really isn’t even their own. 

There are a couple poly people here, right? Hoping you can comment on whether her perception matches yours as well. Not because I don&#39;t believe her — sounds very plausible — but because scene dynamics can vary, regionally and otherwise, so I&#39;m curious.

Overall, the territory she treads in this essay is familiar — it&#39;s the madonna-whore dichotomy, the difference between a good-time girl and the one you take home to mama. I can imagine it&#39;s very frustrating to be sorted into the &#34;whore&#34; category sheerly because of your demographic. Last excerpt:

&amp;gt; Maybe it’s because I date men, but my experience with being less preferred has often been that I’m placed in a position where my intimate partners mistreat me and expect me to stay because they know I’m less preferred. It took me a while to understand that white men like my ex who very performatively trash white women to uplift women of color are doing so out of bitterness and a history of rejection. A lot of times when these men have low self-esteem, they’ll pursue someone they know they have more privilege than to prey on theirs instead. **Through our relationship, I knew he had insecurities, but I didn’t make the connection that those insecurities meant that he was intimidated by the white women he preferred and that he saw me as easier to connect with because I existed outside of most people’s preferences.** When he spoke about white women, it was always about how they were too prissy or high maintenance. He’d complain about women who had standards and were willing to say no and not settle for less. In retrospect, I can see that he knew he’d get away with relying on me financially because perhaps subconsciously, I did buy into the idea that a relationship with him was flattering, and I didn’t want to walk away from it. Chasers will often trash cis women in a similar way. They’ll talk about how much more feminine trans women are and how bitchy and stuck up cis women are. It’s all constructed to prey on the insecurities they know society promotes within you. These are often relationships where I’m expected to do a lot and to put up with more shit than the women they prefer. I cannot even believe that I spent all of this money in my last relationship providing for a man who is far more privileged than I’ll ever be, but that’s often the position you end up in. **These men often expect you to do more labor for them because you do not have the same bargaining power as their preference. I’ve seen men who were broke for me, be rich for their preference.** These relationships always left me feeling depleted and the only reason I speak so much about them is that they’ve left me with lasting trauma that has very viciously affected me and made me so fearful of men and their true desires. For that reason, it’s hard for me to hear conversations that attribute bigotry to someone rejecting someone they do not prefer. **I struggle to buy into the idea that because a man is attracted to me, he’s less bigoted than the men who reject me on the basis of who I am and leave me alone. I wish so many of my former intimate partners simply left me alone and pursued their preferences until one stuck. I wish they’d stop using me as a stop gap between relationships with the kind of women they prefer.** I wish I could stop being in relationships where I’m expected to settle for less, because of who I am. I cannot remember every man who’s rejected me for being a trans woman, but to this day, I feel the pain of being so intimate with men who mistreated me because I’m a transgender woman.

I definitely sympathize with the issue of having your low self-esteem used as manipulation leverage within an intimate relationship, by someone who is doing that shit because they too have low self-esteem (whether the self-assessment, by either party, is warranted or not).

Another theme of the essay, not emphasized as much in the longer passages that I quoted, is the degree to which desire is culturally mediated. She writes, &#34;What I dislike about this discourse is that on one hand it acknowledges that the type of people we&#39;re attracted to is linked to our socialization, but it downplays the depth of that socialization.&#34;

As for myself, I don&#39;t really have a point here. I thought her perspective — her inside view of dating as a black trans woman — was very interesting.

The scale of the answer(s) might be pretty expansive.

Why does the Left hate Ronald Reagan so damn much?

Or, more specifically, what did Reagan do, exactly, to earn so much opprobrium from progressives?

I see it all the time online, people who are on the left/progressive side of politics casually dropping a &#34;Reagan started the destruction of the American middle class&#34; into a conversation with no explanation or context.

I was was born in the late 70&#39;s so I don&#39;t have any memory of what times were like before the Reagan Era.  I&#39;d ask my parents, but their perspectives are probably skewed by the fact that they were only just growing up and starting their adult lives before 1980, plus they came from pretty poor backgrounds and bootstrapped their way into the upper-middle-class by way of being smart (smart enough to work in computer programming in my dad&#39;s case, and smart enough to marry a computer programmer and get the hell away from her white trash family in my mom&#39;s case).  My grandparents are dead so I can&#39;t ask them.

That caveat aside, an admittedly naive reading of American history from the end of WW2 through today seems like: 1950s, we&#39;re doing great, mostly because we&#39;re the only major power that didn&#39;t get bombed to smithereens during the war; 1960s still okay but slowing down, Vietnam is a real drag and blow to our egos; 1970&#39;s things start looking genuinely crappy, the oil crisis, inflation, urban decay, crime waves, etc.  Lots of people around the world genuinely thinking that the USSR might be the better place to live.  Then Reagan comes along in the 1980s and America gets its groove back, and within ten years the Berlin wall is falling and the Soviet Union is collapsing and living standards are getting way better.

I&#39;m not naive enough to think that everything good that happened between 1980 and 1988 was because of Reagan, but this general story is more or less accepted among cultural conservatives of what I guess I&#39;ll call the &#34;Tom Clancy set&#34;.

The main knocks on Reagan (in terms of actual economic policy, ignoring things like D.A.R.E and his handling of the AIDS crisis and the Iran-Contra affair) I&#39;m vaguely aware of are:  


1. Tax cuts on the top margin, the so-called &#34;trickle-down economics&#34;.
2. Certain anti-union actions, e.g. the air traffic controllers

That&#39;s it.  So, the economic left&#39;s sacred cows are high taxes on the rich and unions?  I guess it wasn&#39;t that hard to answer my own question.  But is there more to it than that?  How has this &#34;destroyed the American middle class&#34;?  My mom&#39;s aforementioned relatives are all solidly middle class (none of them went to college and they work retail or manual labor jobs) and they all, in 2022, live in decent houses with newish cars and wear name-brand clothing and get to go out to dinner multiple times a year.  They wouldn&#39;t have been doing that in the 1970s!  Not working the same kinds of jobs they do now.

Did it? What does this actually </title><updated>2022-08-29T19:25:46Z</updated><author><name>Lorelei_On_The_Rocks</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">**&#34;Christianity built western civilization&#34;** 

Did it? What does this actually mean? It is a sentiment I encounter often. Including on this subreddit in the course of a discussion a few days/weeks ago (most articulately elucidated by /u/FCfromSSC). 

It usually comes up in arguments between Christian and non-Christian right-wingers. e.g:

&#34;Christianity is a cringe cuck Asiatic soy religion&#34; 

&#34;Actually Christianity is heckin based and redpilled and built western civilization.&#34; 

I disagree with the proposition, or at least, I am pretty sure I do. 

I think &#34;Christianity built western civilization&#34; can be interpreted a number of ways. 

First, and least charitably, it could be taken to mean that Christianity has had a very great influence on western civilization over the course of the past, say, fifteen centuries. This is undeniable. There would be no Gothic cathedrals, no *Divine Comedy* without Christianity. Sure. But I don&#39;t think this is what is meant by &#34;Christianity built western civilization.&#34; Because this is a very tautological and uninteresting interpretation of the proposition. If not for Christianity, European civilization would not bear a Christian stamp. Sure. So what?

There is a stronger interpretation, which is that Christianity added something (or some*things*) to European civilization which, while not explicitly Christian, it would not have had without Christianity. For example, it sometimes said that the scientific method is rooted in a Christian worldview (I happen to think this is absurd). However, I could still probably agree with this. European civilization would certainly have been very different without Christianity. Fun as counterfactuals are, we will never know precisely *how* it would have been different, but it certainly would have been, and many of these differences would probably have been subtle and not immediately tied to the absence of Christianity. 

The strongest interpretation of the proposition, and the one I believe its defenders are adhering to, is something like, &#34;European civilization is/was *great* and its *greatness* is entirely or largely owed to Christianity.&#34; This is the interpretation I strongly *disagree* with. 

It depends on what you think is (or was) *great* about European civilization. If you are a Christian, and you say, &#34;Christianity is true, and therefore a civilization that exemplifies Christian morals and virtue is great,&#34; then we have a very deep disagreement, because I *don&#39;t* think Christianity is true. The argument will have to be suspended while we dig down to a deeper level and argue about the truth of Christianity. 

But most defenders of the proposition don&#39;t tend to argue so bluntly. In my experience, they attempt to find common ground with the non-Christian RWer by which they can persuade them that the greatness of European civilization, agreed upon by both parties, can be credited to Christianity. 

So what made European civilization great? In my view it is obvious. 

First and foremost, strength and power. Various nations of Europe subjected a greater portion of the world than any before them. All of the Americas, all of Africa (save a few stubborn states), great swathes of Asia. It was a feat unequalled in world history, and &#34;great&#34; by any reasonable measure. 

Secondly, artistic and cultural achievement. It is obvious that Europe has been the world center for great art for the past several centuries. I confess I am no connoisseur, but *The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa* has left me in awe since high school. To say nothing of architecture, literature, etc. 

Thirdly, scientific achievement. Again, it is quite indisputable that Europe has been the center of scientific and technological excellence for the past several centuries. Northwestern Europe, in particular. No industrial revolution without England. 

So the question is, to what extent was Christianity responsible for any of these three?

I believe the answer is &#34;barely,&#34; or &#34;not at all,&#34; since Europe was leading in all three even before Christianization. If anything there was something of a backslide on all three metrics in the early middle ages. I&#39;m not trying to resurrect &#34;hole left by the Christian dark ages,&#34; but if Christianity had a stimulating effect on European greatness you would not expect its proliferation to coincide with the political, cultural, economic, and artistic decay that characterized late antiquity and the early medieval period. 

This argument is usually capped off with something along the lines of, &#34;well, you&#39;re just a LARPer, western civilization has been Christian for centuries so trying to resurrect pagan Greece or Rome is just dumb and pointless.&#34; Which may be true, but is also a huge self-own considering how many online Christian RWers are trad monarchist LARPer types. One might as easily say, &#34;well, the west has been liberal democratic for two centuries, now. Trying to resurrect catholic monarchy is just dumb and pointless.&#34; Or bring it even further down to date. &#34;Trying to resurrect the 1950s is dumb and pointless, that was more than half a century ago. Move on, stop LARPing.&#34; You get the point. 

I am aware that today, the great majority of western conservatives are Christian or at least Christian adjacent. In real life, I don&#39;t call Christian conservatives cringe and tell them they should be worshipping the Olympians. That would, indeed, be silly and pointless. I am happy to make common cause with Christian RWers IRL. But this is an argument I get into regularly in niche internet spaces, and I happen to think I have the better part of it. I am curious what the users of this subreddit think, since this is after all one of the niche internet spaces in which I have had this and related arguments. 

SIDENOTE: the also-common argument that &#34;Christianity united Europe&#34; is not addressed above because it is almost too stupid for words. After the dissolution of pagan Rome, Europe was never so united again until the 20th century. Christian Europeans spent centuries warring with their fellow Christian Europeans. And of course during the Based Crusades™ another set of Based Crusaders was up north slaughtering Baltic pagans. Not that any of this matters because pan-European nationalism is dumb in most contexts anyways.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imalmyd/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/imadzpj/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Why do almost all videos on the internet have subtitles all of a sudden?</title><updated>2022-08-29T18:32:51Z</updated><author><name>MacaqueOfTheNorth</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Why do almost all videos on the internet have subtitles all of a sudden?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/imadzpj/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im9xi04/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] How many people here can hold an emotion for 10 minutes?

Sam Harris had a quote recently where he said &#39; 10 minutes of anger can really fuck up your life &#39; and I understood it to be obviously true. But how many people can actually hold an emotion that long? I&#39;ve held sadness twice for a longer period of time: once when a long term gf and I broke up, and once when my best friend killed themselves. I also get angry in spurts - browsing Reddit sometimes does it or hearing peoples various political opinions I disagree with or know that are incorrect - but it&#39;s just a spur of the moment issue. Another example is sports. I love sports but I really never get too up or too down about my teams performance; there&#39;s always next year + being a Marlins and Dolphins fan that would just be an outlet to constant anger. Otherwise, pretty much every other emotion is just done after what seems like several seconds. 

This leads me to question if otherwise I am emotionally comatose the majority of my life? 

Now Sam was talking about it in relation (I believe) of criminality and, as always, of free will and I&#39;m talking about it more on a personal level, and that&#39;s what I&#39;d like to hear feedback on: how long do you hold onto emotions? And how does this impact your life daily and in general?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im9xi04/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im9smmz/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] ~~[Voters are split in support of Biden&#39;s $500 billion student loan handout, Bid</title><updated>2022-08-29T16:12:12Z</updated><author><name>greyenlightenment</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">~~[Voters are split in support of Biden&#39;s $500 billion student loan handout, Biden approval up in new poll](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voters-split-support-bidens-500b-student-loan-handout-biden-approval-poll)~~

&amp;gt;Registered voters are nearly tied in support of President Joe Biden&#39;s recent $500 billion student loan handout initiative, as the economy remains the most important issue to registered voters, according to new poll.

&amp;gt;A new Emerson College Polling national survey suggests that Americans are almost evenly split in favor and opposition to President Joe Biden&#39;s recent student loan handout, with 36% believing the loan handout is too much and 35% thinking it is just the right amount of action. Thirty percent think it is not enough action.

&amp;gt;The majority of registered voters, 51%, believe the executive action will result in colleges raising tuition, whereas 49% think that it will allow students to have more access to education.

538 shows Biden at 42% approval, a little higher than a week ago

https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/

This is the sort of partisan split we would expect for something as polarizing or politicized as his student forgiveness plan. There does not seem to be any evidence yet that Biden is seeing a net-loss of support. 

It&#39;s still possible that SCOTUS will try to block it. RBG not retiring was the ultimate gift for the right that keeps giving, whether it&#39;s Roe v.

I don’t normally enjoy writing about this kind of piece because of how heated people can get, but I found this interesting enough that I’ll give it a go.

Tl;dr: Likes:  
-	Trump, the president 
-	The right’s interpretation of Russiagate  
-	Republicans  
-	Joe Manchin and Stephen Breyer  
Dislikes:  
-	Trump, the person  
-	Progressives (unclear to me how wide a net this casts)  
-	Political tribalism  

Barr tells a few stories that echo what has come out about the Trump administration in a number of books and other sources. Stories like this one:

&amp;gt;AG BARR: It was on June 1 when the president was bellowing at a number of his cabinet secretaries, especially the military guys—the secretary and chairman of the joint chiefs. He was calling all of us “fucking losers” at the top of his lungs. 
Or this one, where he tried to resign over the allegations Trump was making of election fraud:
&amp;gt;AG BARR: He was in a little dining room that adjoins the Oval Office. He was as furious as I’d ever seen him. He confronted me and said, “Did you say this to the AP?” And I said, “I did. Because it was the truth.” I went over some of the allegations. He said there was plenty of evidence of fraud. I explained in some detail why the allegations didn’t fly. I told him that there were only five or six weeks to challenge a presidential election because the Constitution requires the Electoral College to meet at a certain date and he didn’t have much time. He’d already wasted five of your six weeks with this crazy stuff about the Dominion machines. He’d wheeled out this clown show of lawyers that no reputable lawyer is willing to work with.  
&amp;gt;I said, “Look, I know you’re unhappy with me. I’m going to tender my resignation.” And he slammed the table. Everyone jumped. And he said, “Accepted.” So I said OK and left. I was getting into my car right outside the White House and all of a sudden, people started pounding on the windows. It was late at night and raining, so it was sort of this eerie thing. The president sent Cipollone, another White House lawyer, out there, to retrieve me and tell me “Nevermind, he’s not going to fire you, and would you come back in?” And I said, “I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any use to going back in tonight. I’m going to go home. But we can talk about it in the morning.” 

I suppose it depends how much credence you lend to his version of events over Trump’s. Barr genuinely seems to like what Trump did while in office, though, if that moves your needle towards believing him. I won’t link those quotes due to space concerns. He also doesn’t lend any credence to the election fraud theories:

&amp;gt;AG BARR: I was somewhat demoralized that he was leaving office this way. The left says, “Oh, you said all these nice things about him in your resignation.” But I felt that what he should do was focus on all his achievements and leave with dignity. Whether he thought there was fraud or not, he had his day in court and he lost.  
&amp;gt;So I was demoralized that he was going out the way he was. I thought it was very unfair to all the people, especially the younger people, who had worked in the administration. It hurt them getting jobs and it also hurt the Republican Party, which I thought up until then, could take the high ground as the party of law and order.  
&amp;gt;I would say it [the January 6th riot] was an effort to intimidate Congress and the vice president. I haven’t heard words from the president that I would consider incitement under the law. That’s a very high bar because of our First Amendment, and it should be a high bar. But I did feel that he was morally responsible for it because he led these people to believe that something could happen on Capitol Hill that would reverse the election. That there’s something they could do involving pressuring the vice president and Congress that would overturn the election. 

Barr also says a number of things about politics that make me think that compromise and a rapprochement are possible. Perhaps I’m projecting, but he seems to argue against reactionary politics and towards something more constructive:

&amp;gt;Something I’m pretty tired of from the right is the constant pandering to outrage. The picking and picking at the scab without trying to channel those feelings in a constructive direction. In my opinion, Ronald Reagan was a great populist not because he followed the frustrated instincts and the outrage of the people, but because he channeled it and was constructive with it…We have these institutions that need reform. The first step is to win an election with a decisive majority that allows you to put a program into effect and fix some of these problems going forward. That is not done by just throwing fuel on the fire of outrage on one side of the equation while the other side does the same thing on their side…I think we should basically try to persuade people. People like Youngkin, the Governor of Virginia, have shown that the Republican Party is a potential majority party.  
&amp;gt;The problem with Trump is that it’s all about running a base election. Whip up your base, get them all upset and outraged, and turn them out at the polls. Both sides do that. That is a prescription for continued hostility and demoralization of the country. The first side to break out of that will do so by restoring politics to what it should be, which is the politics of trying to capture a majority of the people through persuasion and with a decisive enough majority to change things…I say to the people that want to make America great again, “What will it take to do that?” You don’t do it just by making your base madder and madder.  

And yet, at the same time, the way he talks about liberals is depressing:

&amp;gt;although we’ve been sort of harping on the warts of Trumpism, I think the greatest threat to the country is the radical progressive movement and what it’s degenerated into. In 2016, had there been another Democratic administration, I was concerned that we’d have dug an even deeper hole that would be much harder to get out of. I think Trump did serve a historic purpose: He was sort of the wrecking ball and against progressive excess. People were mad about it, and they wanted a no-nonsense person who would be a wrecking ball, and he did that. What I’m saying now is that we need something different moving forward. I give him credit for identifying people’s frustrations and being willing to call out some of the progressive excess that other people were cowering about then.  

&amp;gt;If we’ve left it behind, I don&#39;t think this ends well for the country. I don&#39;t see that this leads to any future for the country. I think we have to return to that if we’re going to have a future. I put this on the doorstep of the radical progressives as their responsibility. They’re the ones who have sharply shifted. The political model before this was the liberal democratic spectrum where you have right and left, but we’re all within the liberal, democratic, Anglo-American political tradition.  

&amp;gt;What we’ve moved to is a bipolar system that’s more typical of revolutionary countries, where you have a party like the Marxists or some other totalitarian party trying to take power. It’s all or nothing and anything goes. It’s war by other means. That’s where we are, and it doesn’t end well.  

&amp;gt;Those of us who are traditional conservatives, Reagan conservatives––I grew up on Bill Buckley and so forth––believe in the Anglo-American system of politics. We have a First Amendment that allows citizens to debate and come to some consensus for the public good. One of the things that bothers me is that people talk about democracy and the threat to democracy. Well, what did the framers think was the threat to democracy? In Federalist 10, Madison says it’s when the majority uses democracy to oppress the minority. When someone takes a transient 51% majority and tries to ram things down the throat of the other 49%, and now we’re finding ourselves sort of oscillating between those two worlds. Get 51 votes, good: Obamacare. You have 51 votes and you shove it down people’s throats. Whereas the institutions that we’ve had before this were meant to require some form of consensus and incremental change. They allowed people to build up some consensus for an approach, and things moved slowly. That’s not good enough for revolutionaries, who want to tear things down or change things instantaneously. I think that’s the basic challenge we face right now.

I think the traditional thing is to go and scope out a place, get it arranged to rent or whatever, maybe live out of a hotel and work there some while your family stays back where you used to live, and so on. We&#39;re renting, and while we have some flexibility, we want to just leave this place pretty quickly.

The party seems to be at a tipping point on the &#34;Trump good/bad&#34; issue, and a small number of votes could have an outsized impact, as far as I can see. Are there any personal costs incurred by doing this (beyond risking getting more involved in mind-killing politics)? Are there safeguards in place keeping people like me from joining the party?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im90px1/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im8j6bl/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Manosphere is not what it used to be.

It&#39;s been mostly ran off mainstream sites and most classic blogs are since defunct or moved on to other grift. Still there has been an idea I have been developing for a while.

It was always easy to dismiss as toxic masculinity, motivated by misogyny and sexism. This may be to some extent true but I propose a different framing that unites all the disparate factions even though I don&#39;t think they realize so themselves. It&#39;s about the male gender role. It&#39;s no secret that the traditional male gender role is not what it used to be. Between the state and women in the workforce the provider is largely obsolete and the feminism friendly attempts to construct a new one are just unappealing and don&#39;t really address mens desires at all. How the factions differ is their reaction to that.

Redpill sometimes gets accused of being patriarchal and while some are certainly sympathetic to it (though I think part of that faction has split off into the newer tradlarpers) they instead decide feel that women don&#39;t live up to their standards and *enjoy the decline* becoming philanderers instead. The archetype of philanderer did exist but it was never considered something commendable or worth emulating under traditional conventions. The MGTOW are pretty similar, but they decide to quit altogether. MRA try to renegotiate their place using more conventional activist tactics to get the legal recognition framing it in the terms of *rights* in parallel to women. I think what both are really getting at is that women don&#39;t want to hold up their end of the bargain, but still expect men to do theirs and that&#39;s fundamentally unfair. Traditional gender roles might have given men some power that could be abused but it also came with responsibilities that remain unrecognized, even as women got *liberated* from theirs. 

I think this is a discussion we should have, but unfortunately men constructing a new narrative is hostile to modern feminism. When you&#39;re accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression, as they say.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im8j6bl/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im8a4cm/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] NYT had recently put out a [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/opinion/su</title><updated>2022-08-29T07:29:50Z</updated><author><name>ZeStridingTeufel</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">NYT had recently put out a [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/opinion/sunday/maternal-instinct-myth.html?smid=tw-share) claiming that maternal instinct was a myth created by men, presumably to domesticate women and reinforce the patriarchy. The author claims that what a mother should be is actually &#34;socialised&#34; behaviour sold through various disciplines from theology to science, with its earliest archetypes extending to biblical accounts of Mary and Eve, and later fortified by Darwin and other evolutionary theorists as the intellectual domain drifted away from faith. It stirred quite a blowback, and a [rebuttal](https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/08/28/is-maternal-instinct-a-misogynistic-myth/#comments) from Jerry Coyne.

I think its worth discussing why any archetype of maternity is frowned upon as regressive and demeaning towards women. There seems to be a section in hyper progressive academia that thinks that gender roles need to be reversed to &#34;right historical wrongs&#34;, in society, in film, etc. Maybe its just votebank politics, maybe corporations want to discourage family priorities through mass media. I&#39;m not quite sure how this division of consumer demographics between the sexes will end, especially at a time when birth rates are falling and the American establishment is realising that its global unipolarity has ended with an ascendant China, an uppity India and a vengeful Russia on the horizon.

Ar</title><updated>2022-08-29T06:24:25Z</updated><author><name>Electronic-Ant1533</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">**Why does the fat acceptance movement remind you of anti-trans ideology?** 

Are the narrative frameworks of the fat acceptance movement and the anti-transgender movement the same? Both movements posit their respective issues as primarily cultural contagions that are exacerbated by the structure of 21st-century information technology. Additionally, both the fat acceptance movement and the anti-transgender movement imply that the obsession with aesthetics at the heart of American ills has, in the modern era, become the sole arbiter of ethical disagreements. The play-by-play comparison of the typical struggle-session accounts of each movements, I think, is even more revealing of their similarities. I have used scare quotes a lot here, to ensure that no one mistakes either of these opinions for my own.

**The narrative framework of fat acceptance advocates**

* The internet is a **dangerous device**.
* More specifically, the internet promotes the idea that women need to adhere to a specific beauty standard. Before the internet, this beauty standard &#34;didn&#39;t exist,&#34; or at least was not as intensely promoted.
* This beauty standard, of a thin waist, big breasts, etc. is unrealistic and unattainable. **Diets &#34;don&#39;t work&#34; -- that is to say, the media distorts how often people are able to successfully change their &#34;inherent&#34; weight. They are also &#34;dangerous&#34; -- they promote eating disorders**.
* People are brainwashed by the media to accept this aesthetic standard and spread it around their social networks.
* This beauty standard creates socially-derived depression in fat people (that is to say, if this beauty standard were not promoted by the media \[and then spread by people consuming the media\], then this depression would not occur). \*If promotion of this beauty standard did not happen, not only would fat people not be depressed, they would be perfectly happy in their bodies.

As a P.S., such an advocate might claim that there is historical revisionism afoot -- in all of human history, skinny beauty standards are &#34;quite rare.&#34; This is because our ancestors &#34;knew&#34; that skinniness was not a natural state to be in.

**The framework of anti-trans activists**

* The internet is a **dangerous device**.
* More specifically, the internet promotes the idea that people are secretly transgender. Before the internet existed, transgenderism &#34;didn&#39;t exist,&#34; or at least, was not as common.
* Pursuit of a cross-gender beauty standard is unrealistic and unattainable. **HRT and SRS &#34;don&#39;t work,&#34; that is to say, they don&#39;t make people happier, and are &#34;dangerous,&#34; sterilizing people in the pursuit of an aesthetic ideal**.
* People are brainwashed by the media on &#34;transgender ideology&#34; and spread it across their social networks.
* This promotion of &#34;transgender ideology&#34; creates socially-derived depression in people who &#34;think that they are trans&#34; (that is to say, if the &#34;trans ideology&#34; were not promoted by the MSM/social media \[and then spread by people consuming the media\], then this depression would not occur).
* If promotion of this beauty standard did not occur, not only would people who &#34;think that they are trans&#34; not be depressed, they would be perfectly happy in their bodies.

As a P.S., such an advocate might claim that there is historical revisionism afoot -- in all of human history, transgender identities are quite rare. This &#34;shows&#34; that in general, our ancestors &#34;knew&#34; that transgenderism was unnatural.

**What to make of this** 

It seems that ultimately this congruence results from very similar opinions on the average American locus of control. Both movements see people as fundamentally unable to self-evaluate in a media vacuum, and  both groups imply that we should automatically view opinions which mysteriously coincide with those of the MSM with suspicion.

## The radfem-trans activist beef, and its potential relation to the framework of the fat acceptance movement

The MSM (and social media) claims that the clashes between trans activists and radical feminists result from different opinions on gender essentialism. However, considering the overlap of the fat acceptance movement with radical feminist movements (as both question the ways in which women&#39;s bodies are policed), perhaps the origin of the skirmishes between trans and radfem is not even gender itself. Rather, the narratives each movement has woven rely on fundamentally different appraisals of history, culture, and self-determination, making rapprochement impossible.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im85d0q/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im7wnuv/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] So what should I be cooking with?

The argument about the glass shard strikes me as very odd. Of course it makes a difference if the child comes 5 days hence or a millennia. Within a few years we can probably expect the shard to be buried and rendered harmless. Within a century we can assign a reasonably high probability that the forest track has changed route due to natural subsidences etc. Within a millennia, who knows if any humans will be around at all? So valuing a clear and present threat equally with some theoretical future one seems utterly absurd to me.

Just as the impact of any action we might take is affected by compounding uncertainties, human life is also. Is it not clear that the life of somebody actually alive today is worth more than somebody who&#39;s parents are yet to be born? As one looks further forward, there is less certainty that the hypothetical people your action seeks to aid actually exist! Or even if they do, maybe they are genocidal maniacs that killed your descendants, or otherwise so alien in their values that you wouldn&#39;t Uncertainty in both regards compounds over time.

People obviously care deeply about their grand kids, and thinking of the US Revolution for example, have been willing to make great sacrifices to secure a future for many generations of strangers to come. The discount rate need not be extreme, and probably properly even varies depending on the circumstance (discounting one&#39;s own descendants less steeply than those of your extended family/community/nation/culture/species for example). Of course, one need not do this formally or numerically at all, but if you&#39;re going to build a numerical case for a particular idea, then it seems disingenuous not to at least consider including it as a term.

This sort of thinking is intuitive to me, and I think lines up well as a formalisation of actual human values and behaviour, but I&#39;m curious that I&#39;m not seeing anything like this discussed in the likes of Scott&#39;s OP or follow up &#39;highlights&#39; post for example. Perhaps I&#39;m off base?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im6axzq/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im5ub2m/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] So, what are you reading?

This dataset received an update last week and has since created a lot of buzz in the vaccine-skeptic/anti-vaxx circles on reddit, Substack and Twitter, while receiving comparatively little airtime on more mainstream publications in relation to the (perceived) importance of the phenomenon. The basic finding is that elevated mortality has continued into 2022 and is currently on track to surpass both 2020 and 2021. This is particularly surprising given that we&#39;d expect a decrease in mortality now that a whole lot of vulnerable people have died already. Also note the sharp increase of mortality for people below the age of 44 and especially below the age of 14.

So far, the possible explanations I&#39;ve seen are:

* it&#39;s the heat wave,
* it&#39;s COVID itself or its long-term effects,
* it&#39;s the consequences from lockdowns, including staff shortages, treatment delays, economical and mental health fallout etc.
* and, most controversially of course, it&#39;s the vaccines

None of these seem particularly convincing to me. Why would e.g. heat waves and treatment delays be causing unusual levels of excess mortality for people below the age of 18? If it were the vaccines or lockdowns, the timing seems off. Europe is back open, mass vaccination happened last year at roughly the same scale and time in every European country, so why is Portugal&#39;s mortality going trough the roof right now while Denmark is mostly staying where it&#39;s at? COVID-infections might be contributing, but confirmed deaths are way down in basically every country and it&#39;s also not a known killer of young people. That widespread infections sort of shifted the general population health Bell Curve towards worse outcomes seems plausible, but studies on the side effects that don&#39;t look at vulnerable or severely ill subpopulations tend to come up with pretty unconvincing results IMO and again it wouldn&#39;t make sense for this to affect specifically young people.

Does anyone have a good idea for what&#39;s going on right now? Is it a combination of some of the mentioned possibilities? Or something else entirely? Or is it overblown, we should just wait a few months/a year or two and mortality will normalize?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im3q30m/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im2p5t2/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Lex Fridman [interviewed](https://youtu.be/0ZO28NtkwwQ) Magnus Carlsen today.

He may have used one of my requested questions, but I can’t tell as they were vague. Magnus is the most interesting case study of performance psychology because he’s so beyond his competition, in what amounts to the most competitive cognitive game in the world. 

Some interesting bits from the interview:

* Magnus does not like practicing with puzzles. Neither does he consider himself good at stand-alone puzzles. 

* Magnus hates strict, organized practice. He refused to do this as a child and instead enjoyed exploring interesting parts from books he takes a liking to. When he was younger he “fired” Kasparov as a coach (one of the best players of all time) because Kasparov wanted Magnus to analyze his past mistakes, which he found annoying.

* The above two bits are shocking as it flies in the face of our understanding of deliberate practice. But actually, maybe not! While it’s true that puzzles can be construed as very specific deliberate practice, you come across the scenarios in games anyway, in their “natural habitat” surrounded by other information; so playing difficult games is probably better than specialized puzzles. 

* While focusing on past major mistakes could be seen as optimal deliberate practice, it’s also highly demotivating. Magnus’ practice is odd in that he appears to choose the most motivating path. He reads from books guided by pleasure, and he ignores strict puzzle-based practices. He favors playing games, and if you notice, he very often plays these games with variable strategy in mind. Instead of focusing on one opening, when he plays online he frequently changes openings, tests out things he doesn’t know will work, etc. This is excellent deliberate, variable practice while maintaining motivation.

* While Magnus was the poster child of athletic chess players, in recent years he has fallen out of shape. I find it interesting that he favors sports games over weightlifting or cardio. This has a motivational component, because when he’s playing tennis for an hour or two he’s in a state of competition. I think this extra “competitiveness practice” aids him in chess. 

So I find it interesting that Magnus’ approach to chess prioritizes competition and motivation. I also find it interesting to think that if Magnus were placed in chess school with dry exercises and exams, he probably wouldn’t even make it in the top 200 students. He has a strong aversion to boring practice and is chiefly motivated by real competitive wins, and he’s not good at chess “practice puzzles”. This says a lot about modern schooling: what other talents are we missing out on because we focus on dry, boring practice problems that do not directly translate to real life? Have we missed out on Henry Fords and Da Vinci’s?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im2p5t2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im0xsgc/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] For the Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality fans here on The Motte, here</title><updated>2022-08-27T17:25:46Z</updated><author><name>DuplexFields</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">For the Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality fans here on The Motte, here&#39;s [Daniel Radcliffe singing an appropriately scientific song](https://youtu.be/rSAaiYKF0cs?t=32).</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/im0xsgc/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilzle2b/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] I’ve noticed from social media that  skinny guys with low body fat get more fema</title><updated>2022-08-27T11:00:56Z</updated><author><name>Difficult_Ad_3879</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">I’ve noticed from social media that  skinny guys with low body fat get more female attention than those who have a gym body.

&amp;gt; In graduate school, “I started giving three per cent, and then five per cent, of my income,” he said. This wasn’t much—he was then living on a university stipend. “I think it’s O.K. to tell you this: I supplemented my income with nude modelling for life-drawing classes.” The postures left him free to philosophize. Later, he moved on to bachelorette parties, where he could make twice the money “for way easier poses.”

And finally, after playing with Stable Diffusion, I am blown away. A wholly original work of art created inside a minute. Yes, it is hit or miss, but it is amazing that it can hit at all. 

You are probably already saturated with AI art, but [here are a few of my favourites](https://imgur.com/a/lti20Ia). Perhaps you can tell something about a person from the kind of art they generate.

Anyway, via the game [Space Funeral](https://thecatamites.itch.io/space-funeral), which is a free and excellent two to three hour experience that feels like you&#39;re traversing a slightly humorous nightmare, I&#39;ve become more interested in older experimental music as a means of communicating an atmosphere of horror so that I can bundle it up with my already growing pile of copyright infringement. This has led me down the rabbit hole of early synthesizer music, starting with [Delia Derbyshire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsqxNy8kkg) with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Most recently, I&#39;ve been delving into Japanese Synthesizer stuff, which is frequently very pretty...

And then, there&#39;s 70s-80s French experimental music, which is good at stoking a sense of terror and sometimes downright miserable to listen to (as also is Derbyshire)

Not all the music I&#39;ve posted is good. A lot of it is discordant. But Space Funeral is pretty fun and if you know any other cool early synthesizer stuff that&#39;s good at creating an ambience, please shoot it over. Anyways, I am complete newb to this stuff and am not sure of how much interest it would be to anyone else. At very least, it you need to terrorize trick or treaters or your significant other during Halloween, some of these tracks will do a good job.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilx0jd2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilvmmbv/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] So I&#39;m still greatly enjoying Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but I had to take a week o</title><updated>2022-08-26T15:05:01Z</updated><author><name>WhiningCoil</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">So I&#39;m still greatly enjoying Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but I had to take a week off to travel.

The job system hasn&#39;t really opened up as much as I&#39;d hoped.  I&#39;m like, 40 hours into the game, and all my jobs are still capped at level 10.  I can clearly see they go up to level 20, I just have no idea when/how I uncap them.  Will it be story related, or a sidequest?  I guess I&#39;ll find out.  But that obnoxious cap turns the job system from something fun, to a chore where I&#39;m constantly rejiggering my party&#39;s jobs because someone hit their cap, and I don&#39;t want XP to goto waste.  I can&#39;t fucking wait for the cap to go away.

The story is **very** Xenoblade.  If you&#39;ve played one, you know what I mean.

The geography and world design at first seemed very bog standard.  It&#39;s gotten much more creative and alien as I&#39;ve gone along.  It&#39;s funny though, because Xenoblade 1 and 2 both started off with monologs about &#34;This game takes place on the back of a giant titan(s)&#34;.  Xenoblade 3 just throws you in, with no explanation about the construction or orientation of the world.  I think it&#39;s still taking place on a titan?  Maybe the corpses of the titans from the first two games?  I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;ll be interesting if they just never fucking tell you, but I think I&#39;d like at least a few more hints.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilvmmbv/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilvknaj/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] They did it.

I was at a funeral, big Irish family, and all the men in the family seemed to be at extremes. Either 6&#39;3&#34; or taller and muscular, owned businesses or served in the marines; or on disability with some variety of genetic defect that prevented them from ever holding a job. It was a striking pattern, I meet one son who has had nine heart surgeries, the other son is on a scholarship and looks like the guy she tells you not to worry about. One daughter has muscular dystrophy, her sister is a judge.

I&#39;m thinking of other examples in my life. Twins on my little league team, one batted third and one batted ninth. Law school classmates in the top-5 of our class, who had siblings in nursing homes.

Is there any logic to this or am I just seeing random statistical noise?

Well, the other obvious one is to get a better job, so to clarify why it&#39;s even a problem: I&#39;m basically a NEET right now, have been for like 6 years, failed to complete my undergraduate (physics) degree, never been employed. So, it at least *feels like* I have no marketable skills, and like my executive dysfunction will keep me that way. Also my social anxiety has probably only got worse in this time.

I understand that this might be a nearly impossible task; there are neurotypicals out there that almost never make social blunders...and this is not far from average, in my view. I&#39;ve been practicing lots, and have made some new friends...but I still get the feeling that they are basically secretly annoyed by me and only tolerating me out of a sense of pity and politeness. How might I get to the place where I think the average neurotypical is: seemingly effortlessly graceful, never making a mistake big enough to be put into words while sober. Watching two average people talk, to me, is like watching Olympic gymnasts or professional ballerinas. My therapist has been helpful - but she hasn&#39;t given me much that would help me get that level of grace.

Also: I find it interesting that people expect me, at 27, to have had some relationship history even though I am shorter than average and not that good looking - as well as being awkward. I wonder if they expect me to have, at least at some point, have bitten the bullet and been in a relationship with someone who I wasn&#39;t all that interested in or who had very real shortcomings that impacted them every day...maybe they were 300 pounds overweight. Maybe they had a drug or alcohol problem. Maybe they were no shit crazy and wound up in mental hospitals twice a year. IDK what it is. Is there any way that I could figure out how to accept being a nurse and caretaker to someone that is more or less disgusted by me? I&#39;d like to have a family, and if that is what it takes I&#39;d consider it, but it is a hard pill to swallow - being a single father, functionally, while also being a nurse and caretaker for a wife that is committing slow suicide. That takes toughness and discipline.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilmxnyb/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilme9gr/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] I tested positive for covid yesterday.

I&#39;m still kind of doing some work, but mostly just keeping up with absolutely critical stuff, and taking it easy otherwise.

When I was a kid and would get to stay home sick from school, I&#39;d always play video games. My mom wouldn&#39;t let me stay home unless I was actually pretty sick, but if I did, then I&#39;d usually get to play for a while. Now I have this association with being sick and playing video games.

So I&#39;m finding myself at home, sick, trying to find a game to play. But, I can&#39;t really even manufacture an interest for games anymore. Even after looking through a bunch of reviews, reddit threads, etc. I want to want to play something, but I can&#39;t conjure it at all.

Idk, has anyone else noticed a similar decline in interest in gaming over the years? I never thought I&#39;d get old and stop playing games. But, here we are, and I&#39;m only 30. Nowadays I mostly just want to read a book, browse Hacker News, or work on some side programming projects.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilme9gr/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilmasea/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] What&#39;s the best source for looking up nutritional information (mostly calories) </title><updated>2022-08-24T17:21:24Z</updated><author><name>LoreSnacks</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">What&#39;s the best source for looking up nutritional information (mostly calories) on non-prepared food ingredients?

I&#39;ve done one in July &amp;amp; August so far. I charge a small fee for coffee &amp;amp; pastries ($10), and a local nonprofit is shouldering most of the financial load in paying for advertising. (mailing postcards to registered businesses within the ZIP code) Tonight, I&#39;ll be working with a local marketer to start scriptwriting for online video content.

Results are mixed. Less than 10 people are showing up right now, but 3 are returning ticket buyers. Also, I&#39;ve had people on city council show up. An acquaintance also wants to shadow me next month to set up a similar service across the other side of the city.

So now I&#39;ve got to figure out how to keep pushing through the growth stage.  Current marketing (I&#39;m told) costs $500/mo, which is not sustainable. The 501c3 has told me I cannot operate as a business if I&#39;m to continue enjoying their support. It is possible to set up as a nonprofit with various designations (501c3, 501c4, 501c6) but I have to educate myself on the pros and cons of each of these. 

The biggest con for now: I am used to making executive decisions by myself, and I don&#39;t feel get warm fuzzies about forming a board. I don&#39;t trust the talent pool available, given what I know.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilm8ko6/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/illtpd0/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] What are some &#34;low-hanging fruit&#34;-type cybersecurity certifications that a non-c</title><updated>2022-08-24T15:34:10Z</updated><author><name>thisismymilitaryalt</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">What are some &#34;low-hanging fruit&#34;-type cybersecurity certifications that a non-coder could pick up relatively easily?

Awaiting future pain.

While I was there, I overhead a not-really private discussion between the nurses about the [removal of 377A](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-62545577). Some of them defended the decision to protect the definition of marriage (&#34;the religious feel threatened&#34;), others decried the move as useless because of it. But overall, none of them were interested in actually defending 377A directly. 

I&#39;m reminded of this passage from [_Neutral vs. Conservative_](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/01/neutral-vs-conservative-the-eternal-struggle/)

&amp;gt; In the hospital where I work, there’s a RESIST TRUMP poster on the bulletin board in our break room. I don’t know who put it there, but I know that anybody who demanded that it be taken down would be tarred as a troublemaker, and anyone who tried to put a SUPPORT TRUMP poster up next to it would be lectured about how politics are inappropriate at work. This is true even though I think at least a third of my colleagues are Trump supporters.

Why do I post this in the Wellness Wednesday thread? Well...

A few months back, I was really bummed out by observations like these. Like the Communist that seethes at perceived edifices to captialism all around him, I could not help but observe the prevailing attitude of mild cultural liberalism around me, and it brought me a significant amount of distress to think about my observations (which is to say, I upset myself daily). 

Today, I realise I&#39;m no longer upset by the observations I make, even though I still believe in the baseline conclusion that society is fundamentally biased. Above all else, I no longer despair, I no longer feel blackpilled, and I think this is because I plan to actually **do things** to change the world. An obvious lesson for the depressed among us: Make plans, get organised, and above all else -- try. The work of struggle, whether consequentially productive or not, will make you happier for the moment.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilkt0k3/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
