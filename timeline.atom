Over the weekend, my NYT digest pinged me with the now one year old wellness article *[Do We Really Need to Take 10,000 Steps a Day for Our Health?](https://archive.ph/Xq0Fv#selection-319.0-322.0)*. As someone that&#39;s immediately triggered by people looking for excuses to justify their sedentary lifestyles, I naturally clicked through for a quick rage-read (put aside for a moment how unhealthy *that* behavior is). So, what&#39;s the origin of the claim that fewer steps is actually fine?

&amp;gt;A 2019 study by Dr. Lee and her colleagues found that women in their 70s who managed as few as 4,400 steps a day reduced their risk of premature death by about 40 percent, compared to women completing 2,700 or fewer steps a day. The risks for early death continued to drop among the women walking more than 5,000 steps a day, but benefits plateaued at about 7,500 daily steps. In other words, older women who completed fewer than half of the mythic 10,000 daily steps tended to live substantially longer than those who covered even less ground.

Wait, *what*? How does this causal inference chain work? If you showed me [that study](https://archive.ph/3Xcuo), I&#39;d think it&#39;s fine as far as it goes, but that the only thing that it really tells us is that elderly women that have dropped to as few as 2,700 steps are often pretty well on death&#39;s door, which is what I would have already expected. There&#39;s pretty much nothing I can draw from that regarding the value of moving more for young and middle-aged people. There definitely isn&#39;t anything strong enough to move me off the prior that moving more is almost always a good thing. I suppose I agree that there&#39;s no magic number and if there was, it&#39;d be a hell of a coincidence that it happened to line up with a shiny, round number, but that&#39;s never really been the point anyway. Oh well though, she&#39;s not done citing evidence:

&amp;gt;Another, more expansive study last year of almost 5,000 middle-aged men and women of various ethnicities likewise found that 10,000 steps a day are not a requirement for longevity. In that study, people who walked for about 8,000 steps a day were half as likely to die prematurely from heart disease or any other cause as those who accumulated 4,000 steps a day. The statistical benefits of additional steps were slight, meaning it did not hurt people to amass more daily steps, up to and beyond the 10,000-steps mark. But the extra steps did not provide much additional protection against dying young, either.

Well, that&#39;s a bit more encouraging, so [what does that study say](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2763292)? 

&amp;gt;A total of 4840 participants (mean age, 56.8 years; 2435 [54%] women; 1732 [36%] individuals with obesity) wore accelerometers for a mean of 5.7 days for a mean of 14.4 hours per day. The mean number of steps per day was 9124. There were 1165 deaths over a mean 10.1 years of follow-up, including 406 CVD and 283 cancer deaths. The unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality was 76.7 per 1000 person-years (419 deaths) for the 655 individuals who took less than 4000 steps per day; 21.4 per 1000 person-years (488 deaths) for the 1727 individuals who took 4000 to 7999 steps per day; 6.9 per 1000 person-years (176 deaths) for the 1539 individuals who took 8000 to 11 999 steps per day; and 4.8 per 1000 person-years (82 deaths) for the 919 individuals who took at least 12 000 steps per day. Compared with taking 4000 steps per day, taking 8000 steps per day was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.44-0.55]), as was taking 12 000 steps per day (HR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.28-0.45]). Unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality by peak 30 cadence was 32.9 per 1000 person-years (406 deaths) for the 1080 individuals who took 18.5 to 56.0 steps per minute; 12.6 per 1000 person-years (207 deaths) for the 1153 individuals who took 56.1 to 69.2 steps per minute; 6.8 per 1000 person-years (124 deaths) for the 1074 individuals who took 69.3 to 82.8 steps per minute; and 5.3 per 1000 person-years (108 deaths) for the 1037 individuals who took 82.9 to 149.5 steps per minute. Greater step intensity was not significantly associated with lower mortality after adjustment for total steps per day (eg, highest vs lowest quartile of peak 30 cadence: HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.65-1.27]; P value for trend = .34).

OK, this is actually pretty good. It&#39;s still more in the direction of predictive data than advice (IMO), but those differences are *really* large. We should be looking at that and describing dropping to 4,000 steps per day in middle age as an emergency, a strong predictor of impending doom. This doesn&#39;t necessarily provide advice for the young, but we can probably start drawing some inferences about just how bad it is to not move around much. Of note, the 12,000 step group actually did a decent bit better than the 8,000 step group; they have overlapping confidence intervals, so that&#39;s a weak conclusion, but I&#39;d personally be inclined to take it as a suggestion that we don&#39;t really have any cap on the &#34;more is better&#34; line of thinking. What&#39;s the conclusion from our intrepid NYT reporter?

&amp;gt;The good news is that upping our current step counts by even a few thousand additional strides most days could be a reasonable, sufficient — and achievable — goal, Dr. Lee said. The formal physical activity guidelines issued by the United States and other governments use time, not steps, as a recommendation, and suggest we exercise for at least 150 minutes a week, or a half-hour most days, in addition to any moving around we do as part of our normal, daily lives. Translated into step counts, Dr. Lee said, that total would work out to a little more than 16,000 steps a week of exercise for most people, or about 2,000 to 3,000 steps most days. (Two thousand steps equal approximately a mile.) If, like many people, we currently take about 5,000 steps a day during the course of everyday activities like shopping and housework, adding the extra 2,000 to 3,000 steps would take us to a total of between 7,000 and 8,000 steps most days, which, Dr. Lee said, seems to be the step-count sweet spot.

Wait, *what*? How is that the &#34;sweet spot&#34;? Is this based on the idea that it&#39;s some unbearable suffering to go for a long walk? I&#39;m just absolutely blown away that anyone would treat 10,000 steps as (implied above) unreasonable and unachievable. Just how low of a bar are we setting and why is that the tone that a NYT blogger wants to set for people?

On one level, I know I&#39;m being petty, but I actually do think misunderstanding causality and failing to actually look at the data in a couple pretty simple papers highlights just how bad science and medical journalism is. It&#39;s not just politically charged topics like Covid and environmentalism, it&#39;s something as simple as, &#34;should people be advised to take more than 8,000 steps?&#34;. When the writing is this bad on something that I wouldn&#39;t expect bias to creep in, I find that I&#39;m unsurprised that it goes completely off the rails on topics where there&#39;s a tribal affiliation with morally good conclusions.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifpphsh/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifp0lwd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] According to [this graph ](https://nitter.net/QuarantinedCoof/status/15461851456</title><updated>2022-07-11T07:01:36Z</updated><author><name>RadicalizeMeCaptain</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">According to [this graph ](https://nitter.net/QuarantinedCoof/status/1546185145698353154#m), Biden&#39;s approval rating took a big dip after the Afghanistan pullout.

Week 2/60 is behind me. Not much to report. Water fasted Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and today. 2 more weeks until I begin resistance training and trying to put on muscle. Shedding fat at a crazy rate but perceptibly losing muscle mass as well as to be expected. I can notice a tiny bit of loose skin around my abdomen in dim lighting but not as bad as I feared. No clue whether fasting is helping on that front but still seems worthwhile since I am leaning out so fast. Am extremely eager to hit the weights in a few weeks. I will post before once I am done dieting in a few weeks.

Current plan is to fast Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday next week. Then Monday, Tuesday, eat maintenance on Wednesday and then conclude with a 4-day fast to complete my leaning out phase. After that I will slowly reintroduce calories until I get to a calculated maintenance for a week or two and then lift at a small caloric surplus. 

Will report back next week.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifofoo2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifnth1f/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] What happens to thinking people who are clearly wrong but [whose heads haven&#39;t e</title><updated>2022-07-11T00:16:45Z</updated><author><name>Ilforte</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">What happens to thinking people who are clearly wrong but [whose heads haven&#39;t exploded](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_dennett_the_illusion_of_consciousness?language=en)? 

The (imo) stupid adage that science advances one funeral at a time is so old that I think it has finally [overstayed its welcome](https://rootsofprogress.org/how-curing-aging-could-help-progress) and, with any luck, we&#39;ll bid it final goodbyes soon enough. 

Yes sometimes, often even, it is right on the money. There are walking scholarly zombies all around: people who&#39;ve bet it all on a hypothesis, have been publicly and convincingly proven wrong (or had the ground move under them to the point their entire map became obsolete) and have not recanted. Indeed, some double down or just begin to ignore all criticism. 

What do we know about such cases and such people? Are they just cognitively rigid and emotionally invested? Bound like slaves to a cottage factory that has been built around their assumptions, perhaps? Does the stress of debunking alter their reasoning somehow, degrade it maybe? How does it feel from the inside? I&#39;ve seen some curious patterns, but don&#39;t want to bias you.

I was reading about that [Russian fox experiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox). Domesticated traits started to occur only after the second generation. After six generations you had a few hyper-domesticated foxes and by the 20th generation 30% of foxes constituted this hyper-domesticated status. 

The Christian social system appears especially conducive to domestication.  Only those with especially prosocial tendencies will get the most out of services; those with especially “domesticated” qualities will be graded best by peers according to the Christian rubric of grading another’s behavior; greater voluntary activity within the church would draw in the especially prosocial, creating prosocial pairings similar to in the Fox experiment. Those who best internalized the behavioral proscriptions of the Church had the highest status, and this obedience is a kind of domestication. Traits like intelligence, humor, and athleticism have no real value in the historically Christian social system, although a minimum amount of intelligence was probably necessary to secure a mate.

Compare to what (little) we know about Paganism. Paganism had no such fixation on domesticated qualities.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/iflb2gs/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifkz35p/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] So a few months ago, I stumbled upon the [Healthy Gamer Youtube channel](https:/</title><updated>2022-07-10T10:51:07Z</updated><author><name>cae_jones</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">So a few months ago, I stumbled upon the [Healthy Gamer Youtube channel](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UClHVl2N3jPEbkNJVx-ItQIQ), and found some of the suggestions there helpful as regards creative projects.

They’ve always hated that I cut the sibling off and have continually pressured me to reconnect for years. The estrangement has gone on since 2010.

The sibling was physically abusive toward me, as well as very emotionally abusive. I have other siblings and they maintain a relationship with this one. When the estranged sibling comes up in conversation with the other siblings, it is almost always complaints about their abusive behavior. Which leads me to believe I made the right decision for my own sanity, and that the behavior that precipitated the estrangement is ongoing. 

This situation with our parent has led the abusive sibling to reach out to me, but the thought of talking to them or even being in the same room as them gives me a great deal of anxiety. I did not respond. 

But I’m getting even more pressure than usual - parent is dying. My estrangement of the sibling is “killing” them. Why can’t I just let bygones be bygones. 

They won’t listen to me when I describe being abused by this sibling, or when I point out the hypocrisy that the dying parent didn’t talk to their siblings for decades because of shitty behavior. They have a history of ignoring abuse, like with another family member who is an accused child molester (I have personal experience that this accusation is 100% true) and is still invited to gatherings. 

I guess I just don’t know how to navigate this. I live in a different state, visiting theirs, and I am trying to spend time with my dying parent but every time we talk, it’s brought up how I need to put aside my differences with the sibling and make amends. 

It makes me doubt my own experiences and makes me feel intense guilt. Part of me wants to placate them. Part of me wants to go home and never contact my parents again.

The tldr on the Gambler&#39;s Fallacy is this &#34;We&#39;re flipping a coin. It hit heads the last 4 times, so we&#39;re due a tails this next time.&#34; But, the law of independent variables tells us that&#39;s BS. Each flip is independent, and so the odds of hitting tails doesn&#39;t go up each time you hit heads.

But, does the odds of a heads *increase* for each heads previously flipped?

I want to argue yes, and yeah, I&#39;m aware of the Hot Hand Fallacy. But here&#39;s my idea...

After some improbable number of consecutive heads flipping (and this is important) *the same coin*, the odds that the coin isn&#39;t fair increases. Cheating starts to become a better explanation than just chance.

And this becomes apparent at the extreme. Imagine a coin has been flipped 1 million times, heads all 1 million of them. Then we flip a million and oneth time. What are the odds of heads? It&#39;s not 50/50, because the 1 million previous flips are basically proof positive that the coin is rigged.

If that last million-flip example makes sense, I&#39;d wonder where is the number of flips where we start to think there&#39;s a meaningful deviation from the 50/50 prediction.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifjq0i7/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifj0415/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] to those who have done deep dives into metaphysics/ontology/epistemology: is it </title><updated>2022-07-09T22:33:40Z</updated><author><name>SebJenSeb</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">to those who have done deep dives into metaphysics/ontology/epistemology: is it worth it? to me most of these arguments are a great example of philosophical masturbation about things that dont mean anything in the real word.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifj0415/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifiszzt/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] So a Nazi walks into a bar.

Yesterday night I was at a party (purely social, alcohol and some other substances involved) in Oakland with some friends and got a bit bored, so I asked someone what their most controversial opinion was. Their response was that... they thought Trump was a criminal and should be in prison, an opinion that was well-received by the group. Which left me in a bit of a pickle when the question turned around to me. So I chickened out and offered something off the wall about non-practicing pedophiles being condemned too harshly by society. Which was a bit spicier, but it was carefully constructed not to be relevant to any hot button issues that would actually be controversial. (Yes, it&#39;s pretty crazy that I felt like a NAMBLA-adjacent opinion is less controversial than saying something like &#34;school shootings aren&#39;t a major issue in our society&#34; or &#34;1/6 wasn&#39;t really important or a threat to our democracy,&#34; but there we are.)

But it got me to thinking: where can I find real-life friends or social settings where there&#39;s actual space for debate and discussion? Luckily my girlfriend is pretty open-minded, but (at least among the friends I&#39;ve made, mostly professionals in the Bay Area) it seems hard to find social spaces that are open to discussion to contentious topics without them devolving into insults or attribution of bad motives to someone.

Or am I just being overly neurotic here? Maybe I should have just stated something actually controversial instead of hoping someone else would, since I brought it up in the first place? In retrospect it was probably unfair for me to ask someone else to go out on a limb when I was too scared to myself...</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifih61c/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/iffvcby/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] [She works in cryonics now](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/ageless).

(set cca 2600 or so)

&amp;gt;I was thinking about how free of mobs recent centuries had been: **to create a mob there must be public meetings,** and public meetings in our time consisted of individuals communing via the All Thing or other datasphere channels; it is hard to create mob passion when people are separated by kilometers and light-years, connected only by comm lines and fatline threads.

Indeed, it seems  that networking supercharges mobs, and the networked ones are even worse than the physical  ones.  They don&#39;t dississipate when they get hungry and tired, and they keep egging each other on.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ife1wvw/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifdq2if/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Some old books (e.g. *The Arctic Home in the Vedas*) argue the original Indo-Ary</title><updated>2022-07-08T19:08:12Z</updated><author><name>6tjk</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">Some old books (e.g. *The Arctic Home in the Vedas*) argue the original Indo-Aryan homeland was located above the Arctic Circle based on readings of the Vedas and Zoroastrian texts that are argued to only make sense based on them being set in the far north, such as descriptions of year-long days or descriptions of stars that imply they were observed from near the North Pole.

It’s a fairly large and active community of Christian polygamists. They’re not associated with a denomination (definitely not Mormon) and seems to be legitimate biblical scholars. They have reasoned their way into polygamy with carful reading of scripture. If you liked watching Big Love and want to really see how modern polygamists live. Here’s your shot. 

Some observations:

* They seems to be quite persecuted within mainstream Christiandom. As you would expect.
* They also seem to be quite intelligent and know the Bible inside and out. They can support their position quite well and it seems difficult find a flaw in their logic. As a Catholic, I can’t say that I’m an expert on scripture and the only argument I have against their logic is that The Church has taken a very diffierent view on sex and marriage. Without having The Church as an authority, I don’t know how evangelicals who stick to the Bible as ultimate authority can pin these people down. 
* There does seem to be some motivated reasoning going on here. Some posters are clearly looking to justify their lust and build a harem, but most seem to be quite sincere. 
* The community is surprisingly healthy with lots of activity and very collegial users. Reminds me of themotte in some ways. 

I find the whole thing fascinating. Besides the whole intellectual discussion of polygamy and the Bible there are quite of few gems in here. Ever want to see a bunch of Christian men painstakingly discuss whether or not lesbiansism between sister wives is a sin (spoiler: it’s not)? Ever want to see full throated defense and encorgament of patriarchy? I’ve always loved to observe these types of communities that I would otherwise not know about. Reminds me of early internet days. 

I won’t link to the the forum, but you can google christian polygamy forum and find it quite easily.

I&#39;m 23, male, white, just finished a master&#39;s degree, starting a career in software engineering, normal-looking (though skinny; I&#39;m working on that), and shy in large groups of new people (but alright one on one). The main problem is that I&#39;m gay in a moderate-size city in the US South, population 150,000, whose main university was recently ranked the least LGBT-friendly public university in the nation.

Due to general awkwardness and being busy during college and grad school, I&#39;ve never kissed a guy or been on a date, but girls have definitely liked me, so I think I would do alright if I could just meet some gay guys that are at least slightly nerdy. My question is then how to do that.

There are gay bars in town, but bars aren&#39;t at all my scene, I personally don&#39;t drink for genetic reasons, I&#39;m not looking for a hookup (I could just use Grindr if I was), and it just seems like my kind of guy is unlikely to be at a bar. But maybe I should try anyway?

I tried Tinder and Bumble, but the pools are so small (I exhausted them in just a couple hours) and a large proportion of guys smoke (a deal-breaker for me) or are just looking for a hookup. I got a couple matches, but they almost immediately stopped responding, which I suppose is to be expected on the apps.

To make some regular friends in town, I&#39;ve started going to a board game club. There used to be a pretty active programmers community in town, which apparently kind of collapsed during the pandemic, but I&#39;ll keep an eye on it. For some physical activity I&#39;m thinking about joining a recreational soccer league this fall.

Thoughts on any of this would be appreciated, thanks!</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if3qh70/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if3dicu/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Has anyone managed to reverse their myopia?

&amp;gt;This is a method that says that some specific poor vision habits plus slightly-too-powerful glasses induce myopia, and that some other specific good vision habits plus different glasses can reverse it.

&amp;gt; In various corners of the internet there is an overwhelming abundance of anecdotal claims from people who aren&#39;t sockpuppets (I checked) that the model&#39;s interventions are effective. This is what led me to try it. A lot of the information here is based on a synthesis of the perspectives provided by people in various communities attempting this process.

https://www.losetheglasses.org/

The key idea seems to be not to over-correct your vision for your current task. If you are looking at a computer for 8 hours a day, do not wear your full strength distance glasses, but a weaker pair that are just strong enough to see the screen.

This sounds plausible and fairly cheap to try.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if3dicu/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if3cld0/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] Woke up at midnight, puked, had to shower to get cleaned up, restless sleep off </title><updated>2022-07-06T16:32:52Z</updated><author><name>bl1y</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">Woke up at midnight, puked, had to shower to get cleaned up, restless sleep off and on, 101 fever.

It&#39;s a fun thing to organize my strength training around, and the incredibly technical nature of the snatch/clean-and-jerk would probably appeal to a lot of y&#39;all. So many layers to dig into with these two moves. 

It&#39;s a great sport because it requires strength, balance, flexibility and a Motte-level obsession with analysis and details.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if2h0sf/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if1ptbl/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] I&#39;m able to get 2 hours of work done every other day and work out twice a week a</title><updated>2022-07-06T07:20:30Z</updated><author><name>practical_romantic</name></author><category label="WW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ww" term="Wellness Wednesday"/><content type="text">I&#39;m able to get 2 hours of work done every other day and work out twice a week as the gym is 45 minutes away.

Not great progress but programming is quite fun although taxing. My aim for this week is to workout 3 days a week and work 4-6 hours daily while ensuring I get plenty of sleep at the right time.

It&#39;s genuinely bad but still honest progress and with achievable goals.

Here&#39;s also a text exchange between me and a friend of mine that describes an event which will be the last part of my post. 

So I met my classmate who got into IIT Kanpur today for breakfast
He was here with two other dudes from his uni, one was from CS and the other from materials.
My classmate and the CS dude hadn&#39;t taken a year off like I had and they went from being wierdo nerds who were prentious to well adjusted people who&#39;d indulge in hedonism and doing well in life.
Good to get periodical reminders like today.
I don&#39;t have any girls I text for now and will keep it that way.
You&#39;re right about time man.
I can have all the fun in the world but for now, back to work.

IIT Kanpur is the best uni in the country and is above the one I go to. Both these people have gotten selected by different grad schools (UIUC and CMU respectively) with a bare minium research profile since the recommendation of faculty there matters a lot. 

My point is that there&#39;s a time and place to have fun and there&#39;s a time and place to just study, my current situation is the latter. 

I was genuinely surprised when I was able to solve programming questions and got a sense of joy doing that so shall continue. Working out is a tad hectic and people mock me for even trying since I&#39;ve been doing it on and off for the past year but would go for a week and not go again for a month due to the pajeet exam schedule. 

Anyway, have a fun week ahead.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if1ptbl/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
