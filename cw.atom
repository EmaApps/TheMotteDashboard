We have a dev site at https://www.dev.themotte.org/. I strongly encourage you to make an account and test stuff out. Change settings, try to break it, make sure it works how you&#39;d expect it to. Can you find problems? Please find problems! Report them here, or at the, uh, dammit, I don&#39;t trust Reddit to not filter this. Report them at the repo on https://github.com/themotte that says it&#39;s for the website. If they&#39;re sensitive for some reason, feel free to PM me.

The standard posting rules do apply, with the major exception of the low-effort rule. Low-effort posts are still disallowed, but no-effort posts are explicitly allowed! Post Lorem Ipsum! Post the bee movie script! Write &#34;I am a fish&#34; 400 times! Go wild! Obviously this is a dev-site-only change, this is just to make it easier to test stuff.

If you want to join the dev team, [it&#39;s over here](https://discord.gg/KChpcdaNJC). I cannot emphasize this enough: *this would not be happening if it wasn&#39;t for our volunteers*. They are great. I seriously need to put a Credits page on the site, I haven&#39;t done that yet, but I will. Thank you!

Again, please report any issues you run into, from site-breaking issues to mild inconveniences; every bit of info is useful. I can always triage minor things down, but if I don&#39;t know about them, they won&#39;t ever get fixed.

2-hour-later edit: we&#39;re up to 9 new bugs found, y&#39;all are great, keep it coming

This is a fairly interesting omission from the forum in its own right as this forum has at least traditionally had a strong SF Tech overlap. 

But for those who didn&#39;t get the story, Tornado cash is a new Smart Contract that is intended to obscure the block-chain addresses used in transactions by bundling them together to obfuscate any single transaction. The US Treasury blacklisted the coin blacklisted and declared it illegal for Americans to own or use following it being used to funnel money to North Korea [see: https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1558129960140816384#m, https://www.pcmag.com/news/tornado-cash-developer-arrested-as-blacklisted-crypto-site-goes-down, https://www.foxbusiness.com/financials/dutch-authorities-arrest-suspected-developer-tornado-cash-platform-launder-billions]. 

Dutch authorities (Pertsev is Dutch) have claimed to have an independent investigation and the arrest was for concealing criminal financial flows and money laundering on behalf of the Dutch prosecutor&#39;s office. [https://nitter.net/sccanavos/status/1559530518043148290#m]

This obviously has many developers in arms. Tornado Cash was VC backed and worked to follow the law [https://nitter.net/jonst0kes/status/1558196851169452034#m, https://nitter.net/dystopiabreaker/status/1558196263190876161#m]

Fight For the Future (remember them?) and The EFF have weighed in favor of the developer [https://nitter.net/fightfortheftr/status/1559297577694429184#m, https://nitter.net/EFF/status/1559224086491934720#m] With the EFF taking the long-standing stance that code is free speech (remember that argument)?

Inflammatory title I know, but that&#39;s how traffic works these days. I beg forgiveness on that.

The article basically analyzes the conservative claim on social media from last week that the 87,000 tax collectors in the Inflation Reduction Act would be used to attack poor people. While the maps seem to indicate that, and further seem more specifically to be targeting *non-white people*, the truth of the matter is more nuanced. The audits are disproportionately attacking folks who file the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) due presumptively to some systemic flagging mechanism within the IRS. And since that&#39;s a measure specifically for poor people, their audits also predominantly hit poor people.

Part of this has to do with changes in staffing. They have more low grade &#34;tax examiners&#34; and fewer higher grade &#34;revenue agents,&#34; and the examiners are largely issuing &#34;correspondence audits&#34; which are simpler things which basically just demand more information. But since they&#39;re demanding them from poorer folks who may not have all the information or understand the cryptic language the correspondence audits are issued in, targeting them pumps the enforcement numbers up and makes the auditors look good.

So now if we set that on a shelf and examine one of the more popular definitions of &#34;systemic racism&#34; (Socioeconomic and government systems which produce differential racial outcomes) then it is apparent that the IRS&#39;s EITC flagging criteria are a result of a &#34;racist system&#34; because it fits the definition in use.

Whether this provision within the Inflation Reduction Act itself then qualifies as &#34;racist&#34; will in the end depend on whether the $80 billion earmark in the law includes a way to fix the racist system, or whether it will just be thrown at increasing operations as they currently exist, in which case the EITC audits will just increase.

Have you noticed that, in your middle-upper class bubble of fellow z-millennials, that a big chunk of people vote left only for lgbt rights?

I mean, anedoctically, a big percenteage of my acquiantances vote left only for that reason, also if they do not agree at all economically or politically with them (and are completely straight so they have no skin in the game) 

Real quotes:
&#34;I think that their economic policy is stupid, but I vote them for DDL Zan (a failed law on discrimination in Italy)&#34;
&#34; I hate them because they are not too left wing, but they support lgbt&#34;
&#34; Meh, they looks the only one that protects gays&#34;

It is also true in your experience?
And if so, how is possible that this question has become so important for so many people that have no skin in the game?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikjvwmp/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikjpzhs/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">I&#39;ve noticed an interesting shift among the progressive movement lately. I think</title><updated>2022-08-16T17:45:29Z</updated><author><name>Texas_Rockets</name></author><content type="text">I&#39;ve noticed an interesting shift among the progressive movement lately. I think there&#39;s starting to be a recognition that the fervor and policies born in 2020 were fairly flawed, as evidenced by the legacy of ideas like defund the police, and elections in fairly left areas in which people rejected the progressive candidates in places in NYC, NJ, VA, and SF (the [SF one](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/chesa-boudin-recall-san-francisco-crime/629907/) in particular is interesting. Chesa Boudin really served as a microcosm of progressivism who was given free reign, as were the city council elections that took place around the same time, thus his election served to some extent as a referendum on progressivism).

But what&#39;s interesting is that progressives, in self reflecting and having to analyze why this has occurred, have blamed progressive white people. And to a considerable degree the same thing has been occurring with respect to the policies corporations instituted during 2020. Which is so crazy to me. On the one hand, I agree and find overeducated white progressives who come from wealthy families to be among the most insufferable demographics. But on the other, their only real crime is that they listened to what was being demanded of them, that they be allies and use their supposed privilege to advance the views of anti-racists. It&#39;s kind of like they&#39;re being told &#34;Lol you thought we were serious with all of that stuff? What the fuck is wrong with you?&#34; It sort of validates the view that anti-racists have anti-white undercurrents. Like if they did unambiguously have anti-white undercurrents, how would they respond to the recognition of the ideological excesses of 2020? They would blame white people. Like if you’re a white progressive and want to support movements and ideas like that, at this point I don’t know what the fuck you’re supposed to do. If you don’t support it you’re part of the problem as identified by people you agree with, and if you do support it you’re going to be the scape goat when shit goes south and it becomes clear that the policies you supported to advance the ends you were told to advance were deeply flawed.

I think it also reveals a lack of strategy on the part of people working to advance those ideas, even within their own paradigm. Their view is that white people wield disproportionately more institutional power than non-white people do, so if that’s true you would want those people with outsized power and who agree with you to use that power to advance your ends. But instead they are condemning them and de-incentivizing their participation. It just seems very counterintuitive.

I think it really comes down to the fact that activists are insatiable. when they’re actually given the reins, asked what exactly they want, and allowed to implement policies, they don’t actually know. or if they do have proposals it&#39;s always impractically radical stuff that only makes sense to the small group of people who agree with them like just razing institutions and starting over or defunding the police or something equally as bizzare. it reminds me a lot of the occupy wall street people. They’re the dog that caught the car. They aren’t there to actually catch the car, they’re there to chase the car. implementing the change that they desire requires an understanding of things as they are (you have to understand the problem before you can develop a solution), but activists’ characteristic commitment to ideology precludes them from interpreting the world or developing solutions that go even a bit outside the scope of their ideology. Like can anyone seriously envision a series of events and policies that would have caused BLM to be like &#39;welp. that&#39;s pretty much what we were asking for. you did it and solved the problem. guess we can just pack up our shit and go home.&#39; like even over the course of their ideas being implemented over 10 years I can&#39;t envision that occurring. 

Progressive activists are the dog that caught the car, and once they caught the car and fucked it away they blamed it on the person who served as the distraction that slowed the car down and opened the door for the dog to do what it wanted to do. I think this is indicative of intellectual rot and my view is that to some extent the movement has been exposed and they sorta blew it when they had the spotlight.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikjpzhs/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikiyxbg/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Front Lines in Culture War: Diversity in Policing

I attend town hall meetings in my neighborhood pretty regularly. There&#39;s a new guy who started showing up, and most of his input is focused around &#34;why aren&#39;t you hiring enough minority police?&#34; Because identity matters, he&#39;s a white male in his 30s.

I notice a distinct lack of charity on my end towards his position. The jumping to conclusions are arguments you might have seen before: &#34;He probably doesn&#39;t know any himself, who is he to talk?&#34;, &#34;He&#39;s probably not helping any apply, why isn&#39;t he doing the work to solve this?&#34;, &#34;Who is this White Knight, and why is he expecting other people to do the heavy lifting?&#34; &#34;He probably doesn&#39;t want any people he knows to be police anyway. Does he want to make mental room to be secretly racist, but have plausible deniability because they&#39;re cops?&#34;

The last one, of course, is a terrible conclusion. But it&#39;s still a thought I had, and TBH is also a comment I&#39;d expect someone else to post here. I&#39;m not happy about assuming the worst of him. That he is a sneaky fucker, Literally Hitler In Sheep&#39;s Clothing.

The obvious solution is to find time to take him aside &amp;amp; ask him the questions I&#39;ve had in my head. What steps to take after then, though?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikiyxbg/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikie0e8/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Haven&#39;t noticed an example of this before- in a Spiderman game just ported from </title><updated>2022-08-16T12:24:15Z</updated><author><name>_Cullis</name></author><content type="text">Haven&#39;t noticed an example of this before- in a Spiderman game just ported from PS5 to PC, someone made a mod that replaced flags referring to [our civic religion](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/08/gay-rites-are-civil-rites/)\*  with flags referring to the previous [civic religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_religion).

I did, however, find [this post](https://the-grey-tribe.tumblr.com/post/676558263243997184/there-are-too-many-video-games) arguing about a [Jeff Vogel article](https://bottomfeeder.substack.com/p/there-are-too-many-video-games) about there being too many indie video games.

Leaving aside the...very debateable mertits of said article, this reinforced something that I&#39;ve been thinking about today: is there too much *everything?*

To lay out the life of a modern Western person: there is practically-infinite entertainment to be found, and little worthy work to apply oneself to. Decades ago, supposedly, there were jobs that one could take pride in or even enjoy, and you had to take what you could get for entertainment. Today, there&#39;s so many video games, YouTube videos, TV shows, movies, Twitch livestreams, books, music, and so on to consume. Hundreds of thousands of people are constantly adding onto this pile of information, not to mention a lot the good stuff that came before is still accessible today. This sounds like the end part of Metal Gear Solid 2, which outlines a vision of informational overload, civilizational senesence brought on from the halting of traditional informational eugenics. MGS2 was said to have predicted the Internet&#39;s impact and social media, but I feel that this issue of [monumentality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwGKqiOyIAM), of living in a world with vastly more information than you could ever hope to consume in your lifetime, would not have been forestalled in a world without social media or internet forums.

There&#39;s also the dismal material aspects to consider. The world&#39;s population is somewhere just north of 8 billion, every grocery store is stocked with food products engineered for mass-producibility and cheapness at the cost of other desirable factors, and every person&#39;s estimated impact on politics or productivity is likely so infitesimal as to not matter at all. It seems like getting any job more complex or higher-paying than a burger-flipper or Amazon warehouse worker is a competition where luck is as much of a factor as merit or credentials. On one hand, there are going to be a lot of people who are going to be eliminated from the job market by automation. On the other hand, there may not be enough money to support so many people with welfare. On the third hand, however, the US is no stranger to playing funny games with the nominal numbers of dollar bills that are sent into &#34;the wild.&#34;

Maybe this is just the painful transition period, the growing pains. Perhaps in the future, we will deftly handle these problems brought about by the monumentality of civilization: every job that is too competitive or unrewarding now will be automated, every person will be provided for, and maybe, just maybe, we can still forage *meaning* out of life. Maybe some catastrophe will burn through the forest of human civilization and free up slack in the system (but that&#39;s a big maybe, assuming said catastrophe doesn&#39;t make things so bad that we can never recover). Or maybe things just continue onwards and the human race blindly enters into the biggest rat race of all.

Maybe this is all just my own particular anxieties. I&#39;m more of an artist, I don&#39;t code, and while I&#39;m no stranger to lifting a finger for a job, a fair bit of that was sweeping floors and washing dishes at college. Vogel complains about potholes in his article, but what is there to do when you have no hope of making it as neither an artist nor a road worker?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikhznez/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikgw9wl/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">What do you think the effect of zero code automation will have on employment in </title><updated>2022-08-16T02:31:29Z</updated><author><name>AlternativeEvent2584</name></author><content type="text">What do you think the effect of zero code automation will have on employment in the future? I&#39;m talking about companies like Appian (who someone I know from my CS program works at) or Microsoft&#39;s power platform. I&#39;m more familiar with the latter, but from playing around with it, it seems like it will allow non-coders to essentially automate everything themselves. For example, at my own job we&#39;re doing a little trial where we&#39;re basically trying out one of our departments automating away the need for temps. This MS Power Platform can create GUIs, connect to SQL databases, write to SharePoint, work with APIs, and many other things. So the goal is to essentially have this department automate this and see if we can get it all working. 

If we can, then temps will essentially be gone. And this is only going to get better as time goes on. Furthermore, it will eliminate the need for a bunch of our sys admins because we&#39;re currently moving everything to Azure/365 so they will have nothing to manage.

If zero code works, this might invert the current view of everything being eliminated by coders and instead subject matter experts in accounting or whatever will do the automating themselves even though they can&#39;t code. The top level coders at places like Microsoft will automate away the need for low level coders and sys admins and then they will just collect on those Power Platform E5 licenses. 

I&#39;m new to this as of a few weeks ago so I could be completely off here.

*A few jumbled thoughts, rearranged into Linear Ilfortese B on the advice of /u/f3zinker.*  

With the beta rollout of Stable Diffusion (previously [shilled here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij9ge8b/)), digital artists [have finally taken notice](https://mobile.twitter.com/arvalis/status/1558623545374023680) of text-to-image models, and particularly their ability to imitate individual, modern stylesˆ1 . It seems artists have abruptly phase-transitioned en masse from naysaying to fear and rage, and have promptly shut down @StableDiffusion acc with malicious reporting, in what may eventually be recorded in history books as one of the opening shots in the inevitable Neo-Luddite backlash transcending industries and political tribes. (Additionally: fresh HN discussion of [copyright infringement in AI art](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32436203), of [Stable Diffusion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32471199).) 

The gnashing of teeth, gloating, motivated reasoning, [politruk-level understanding of art itself](https://mobile.twitter.com/senfflasche/status/1559311057310580736), [political allies](https://twitter.com/AmandaTNStevens/status/1557766146920783873/retweets/with_comments) and amusing narcissism ([«The tiniest cock I draw has more soul than what an AI could spit out»](https://twitter.com/Rattfood/status/1559007094598246402)) are all exactly what I&#39;ve had in mind when saying that I don&#39;t like artists as a class of people and welcome their impending professional decimation by AI (a take [which invited some opposition](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijoupt6/)). Of course they&#39;ll fight back. Going beyond Twitter antics, they voice a somewhat reasonable hope for class action lawsuits and encouragement of broader regulation. Artists naturally can have power in excess of their SES, and they love to flex it. Probably it can work, if the powers that be see utility to facilitating their crusade. And maybe (returning to my constant concerns) we&#39;ll see this used as a *casus belli* for a huge push for prohibition of general-purpose compute in private hands (embraced by Lesswrongian AI alarmists and EAs, and Bostrom-WEF technocratic goons). And AI art will be reduced to some gimped alternatives like cloud-only Adobe Photoshop with $5.99 monthly fee for «in the style of James Gurney» meta-brush, with royalties to James or his publisher or estate.ˆ2   

Then again, maybe it&#39;ll fall through. Torrents are still here. And good luck regulating away secure comms like Matrix or Briar or, hell, PGP emails. And Stable Diffusion checkpoints are already being spread around, and a rig with four second-hand 3090s from bankrupt Ethereum miners will be enough for *a great deal* of inference. Most importantly, there&#39;s enough interestˆ3 . Like [Emad says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ2QtKcK2dA) in the recent excellent interviewˆ4, billions of people are *creatively constipated* and they want to let it all out. This may not be singularity yet, but it&#39;s a classical [revolutionary situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_situation). To wit, the case where preservation of status quo would require drastic changes tearing away at its other aspects, introducing unsustainable runaway processes.ˆ5  

The question is, *how* does this continue? Images are of course the least of our problems. Emad can&#39;t wait to automate all forms of media production, and the market will do the rest for «normal» jobs. Savvier artists are, predictably given their socialist leanings but IMO very rationally, advocating [for basic income](https://twitter.com/basicincomecdn/status/1557374154478964737). Alas, it&#39;s not that good, and it may not be the lowest-effort adaptation of our society as it grapples with runaway optimization processes.ˆ6 And beyond that, there are direct AI risks, both existential due to alignment failure (which I&#39;m skeptical about) and ones obvious from human history. But even for art alone, consider these asinine outcomes: 

- Neuralink-powered DRM: content-as-a-service streamed directly into the brain, with per-qualia billing, data interpretable only on this individual human connectome (connectome «keys» owned by Neuralink Corporation, accessed by streaming services through an API), with extreme financial and medical ramifications of tinkering. Episodic memory wiping for extra [dystopian flavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFe9wiDfb0E) (but you keep your ratings, reviews and habits!). For extra [Cheems mindset](https://normielisation.substack.com/p/cheems-mindset): ID-locked screens/output devices with always-online perceptive hash tracking of all consoomable content.  
- Actual anarchy wiping out incentives for professional artistic work. The culture up to 2022 compressed into language to summon combinations, endless Age of the Feuilleton that Hesse adumbrated in his *The Glass Bead Game*. No more innovative one-upmanship of starving artists who sink decades into grokking the craft and exploring its rabbit holes, just «X trending on artstation 8K» forever.

It&#39;s a failure of imagination to go for those. But the status quo can&#39;t continue. [The defaults don&#39;t work.](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/the-defaults-dont-work/) We need to up the learning rate to guess at the future. 

Importantly, what will happen with ideology inherent in contemporary art? Emad promises to train custom models for companies like Sony and Nintendo, and I suppose those will be very good (and if Stability.ai fails, eventually Sony will do it on their own or buy something from a startup or FAANG). But there probably are diminishing returns to the effect of raw quality and quantity on how compelling art feels.  
If you can crank out CalArts style cartoons (assuming people like that style *per se*) with right-wing talking points, and Disney or Netflix animators will do the same but 3x better with their stale propaganda of [embracing monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Beast_(2022_film)), will it matter a lot? Memes with crudely drawn pepes and chads are viral enough; indie games and Minecraft are insanely successful. The Last Of Us II was, I think, [a vessel for Druckmann&#39;s politics](https://collider.com/last-of-us-2-joel-death-neil-druckmann/), and it didn&#39;t persuade people a great deal (on the other hand, people still cite the sophomoric critique of libertarianism in Bioshock, brought to you by Ken Levine, so that depends on specifics). if Druckmann and Levine have the equivalent of Unreal Engine 6 with [automatic generation of arbitrary assets and most code](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/2/23287173/ai-image-generation-art-midjourney-multiverse-interview-david-holz), and Zorba and his friend have the equivalent of mere UE 4 with the same properties, downgraded – will it matter that the former duo has access to AAA tier promotion and the latter just go on Steam and get word-of-mouth fame? 

Finally, will artistry, «style», *stylization* itself survive when it&#39;s not scarce? Will it advance to its llimits?ˆ7 Or will the people, surfeited with it, cast away gimmicks and choose simple, beautiful, ecologically valid naturalism with well-told archetypal stories? Or on the contrary, decide that Apple was right and legible schematics that are easy on the mind are the best – art fading away much like the adolescent Android modding and ricing of desktops?  Will it shard into tiny niche superstimuli, or will generic ones be quickly discovered? How will this play together with VR, Metaverse and its private equivalents, and generational churn? 

I honestly have no idea.

Situation remains the same as last week, no major changes. Russia continues to advance at an extremally slow place where they have concentrated artillery, Ukraine continues to attempt to will a counteroffensive into existence through spiral energy.

That said:

Igor Girkin get&#39;s arrested trying to enter the donbas illegally to fight on the front lines. While I, personally, think he is a huge piece of shit it is admirable that he will put his money where his mouth is. 

Russia reportedly  transferring some of their equivalent to training battalions to the conflict areas. This should add some spine to their infantry, and add some offensive teeth to their forces.

On the Ukrainian side:

A Russian airbase in Crimea exploded due to a dropped Lucky Strike. No aerospace equipment was damaged in the massive fireball, according to Russia. Arial photography later confirms at least 6 su-24s and 3(?) su-30s(?) destroyed. The airstrip remains intact, as far as anyone knows. 

In addition, Ukraine has claimed (with iffy visual evidence) to have rendered the Antonivsky and Kakhovka(Man, I don&#39;t know. Languages are hard) bridges unusable for vehicle traffic. Observers have reported fuel and ammunition shortages in Kherson consistent with two blown bridges, but we wont know for sure for a couple days/weeks.

Ukraine claims these strikes were caried out by purely indigenous systems; missle-fuckers think it might be a Hiluxized Neptune antiship missile retrofitted to hit land targets (bridges), which are a type of ship if you think hard enough.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

War remains slow and steady; with predicted russian counter-counter-offensives in the south, and Kherson continues to be the biggest &#39;pocket&#39; since the korean war if it ever actually happens.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikgj8k4/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikg3ior/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">So, if ya&#39;ll wanna feel some second hand embarrassment, watch the Jim Acosta int</title><updated>2022-08-15T23:01:06Z</updated><author><name>dblackdrake</name></author><content type="text">So, if ya&#39;ll wanna feel some second hand embarrassment, watch the Jim Acosta interview with Andrew Yang re. the forward party, featuring lines straight out of the [Simpsons](https://youtu.be/HqjhHVUzl8o) such as

&amp;gt;“I personally think that women’s reproductive rights are fundamental human rights, but the Forward Party has a, not left or right, but forward stance on even the most divisive and contentious issues,”

First of all, this caused me emotional trauma as a dude who was on the technocratic yang train back when he seemed like a going concern, before he had enough exposure to prove he had no idea what the fuck he was doing politically. I still think his heart is in the right place, but even if I were Hugo Chaves I wouldn&#39;t put him into an office where he would have to try to negotiate any sort of real compromise. 

Second, it makes me wish we could lock every elected official and candidate in a room with a non-hostile but also non-friendly interviewer and not let them out until they have committed to all their positions and defended them at least a bit.

Finally, this further confirms my bias re Centrism and how it either impossible in practice or a contradiction in terms; that if you somehow founded a third party in the US it could do nothing but add another pole.

For those who aren&#39;t familiar, here&#39;s a rundown: Prior to WWII, most urban poor (minorities in particular) lived in overcrowded tenement housing. This was privately-owned, market-rate housing, but conditions were considered substandard at the time and are unthinkable now. A lot of the apartments lacked windows or any kind of ventilation, most units had shared bathrooms, and some still relied on outhouses (in the city) into the 1950s. A lot of the stuff that would easily fail a code inspection now was par for the course. Conditions were crowded to the point that, as one woman recalls, her mother had to sleep in the kitchen as they had to fit 12 people into a 3 room apartment. 

Following the War, there was an increased drive to move tenement-dwellers into modern apartments. This drive had actually started prior to the War, but gained increased impetus when the Housing Act of 1949 made Federal money available to construct housing projects. Throughout the &#39;20s and &#39;30s, the modernist architecture movement had provided a blueprint of how the ideal city should look, and city planners took full advantage of these architects when money became available to put their plans into action. (A detailed description of modern architectural principles is beyond the scope of this post, but if you&#39;re unfamiliar, look up Corbusier to get an idea of what we&#39;re dealing with). 

At first, the project was deemed a smashing success. The design won awards. Early residents talked about how, for the first time in their lives, they were living somewhere where everything was new, and clean, and there was adequate space. On woman said she felt like she was moving into a high-end resort. Another, who was a child at the time, talked about moving in around Christmas, with the moon shining off the snow and lights in every window, and how it felt magical, like they&#39;d finally escaped the slums.

Needless to say, this feeling didn&#39;t last. Within a few years, the place was in noticeable decline, and within ten, it was practically hell on earth. Maintenance issues, exacerbated by vandalism, added danger and seediness. Vacancy rates were high, leading entire buildings to eventually be abandoned, some of which were taken over by drug gangs. Robbery and rape were common in the now unlit stairwells and in the vast expanses between buildings residents entering to complex from the outside had to negotiate to get to their apartments. Security was lax, and police and other emergency personnel were reluctant to respond to calls for fear of their own safety. While an activist organization was able to form to seek redress for these issues, social cohesion was otherwise low, as most law-abiding residents felt unsafe outside their apartments. Throughout the city and nationwide, Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis became a metaphor for everything that was wrong with the inner-city.

In 1968, the activist group staged a rent strike to force the housing authority to address the maintenance and safety issues. The authority, who had for years blamed these issues on lack of funding, asked how they could address any of them if they were starved of the one funding source they could rely on. But the residents had only seen things worsen over the years and wondered what they were paying for. Eventually, the city caved, and rent was capped at 25% of income and there was a commitment to address the maintenance issues. This victory was short-lived, however, as cold air getting in through broken windows that had not been fixed caused water lines to freeze and flood the remaining occupied buildings. At this point, just 15 years after opening, the project was deemed a lost cause, and the remaining residents were slowly relocated elsewhere. In 1972, the project was closed permanently, and all the buildings were demolished by 1976. 

Art critics and historians often point to the day in 1972 that the first set of buildings were imploded as &#34;the day modernism died&#34;. The contention is that the high-minded principles espoused by Le Corbusier and others had been proven empirically incorrect by what Pruitt–Igoe and other, similar high-rise projects had become. This new generation of critics could cite a laundry list of fallacious assumptions that the modernists had made, and, after all, you could tell just by looking at places like Brasilia and Le Corbusier&#39;s designs for a new Paris that these weren&#39;t places anyone would want to live. The modernists were designing for an idealized version of man, and accordingly ended up disregarding basic human needs. Thus we get living space that is too small, outdoor promenades and piazzas that nobody really uses for anything, etc. On a more straightforward note, social scientists argue that it&#39;s simply a bad idea to put large numbers of struggling people all in one large building, as these projects end up breeding all kinds of horrible pathologies. 

As you may have guessed, *The Pruitt–Igoe Myth* fights back against these assumptions. The main thrust of their argument is that complaining about the architecture completely ignores the socioeconomic and demographic factors that led to the most immediate problems. The Federal Housing Act provided money for construction, but not for maintenance; it was assumed that maintenance costs would be paid for out of rents. However, the project had been built based on projections that the population of St. Louis would rise over the coming decades. The population of the city itself ended up decreasing from a high of 850,000 in 1950 to only about 620,000 in 1970, fueled by increasing suburbanization. Accordingly, the project had a high vacancy rate from day one, and the money the housing authority was relying on for maintenance never materialized. As the maintenance backlog increased and the city population decreased, the budget went into a death spiral from which it couldn&#39;t recover. Meanwhile, a declining population meant that housing in more desirable areas was becoming available at low prices, so the project, which was originally intended to be a mix of low and middle income residents, ended up only attracting those who had nowhere else to go. It also touches on ancillary issues like racism, lack of policing, Federal housing policy, etc., but it doesn&#39;t go into them in too great of detail. 

Does it succeed in making its thesis? Sort of. The theory is plausible on its face, and it certainly explains why the project failed so soon. The problem is that similar projects were tried in practically every major American city, and there isn&#39;t one anyone can point to as a success. Some of these places did last well into the 2000s, but the film doesn&#39;t examine any of them to see if their problems were due to similar factors. Anecdotally speaking, Pittsburgh&#39;s housing projects supposedly didn&#39;t get bad until the mid-&#39;80s, but this is coming from residents and not statistics. Again, these problems were also supposedly exacerbated by lack of maintenance, so it&#39;s hard to say whether the producers of the film are on to something. One crucial distinction here, though, is that most of Pittsburgh&#39;s housing projects are and were low rises, and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any correlation between how bad a project is and how big the building is. This is in contrast to the complaints of the art critics and some of the social scientists, who argued that low-rise developments were inherently superior because they were better integrated into the existing community. The counterargument here is that Pittsburgh&#39;s low-rises weren&#39;t integrated into the community at all—they were usually places on isolated hilltops or in ravines, and often had only one way in and out. So I don&#39;t know what to make of this.

The other issue is that all this discussion about modernism and art critics—it&#39;s not in the film, I just happen to be familiar with it. This is the film&#39;s biggest flaw; there&#39;s a theory on why the project failed but no discussion of the theory behind why it was supposed to work or in-depth examination of the criticisms of that theory once the failure became apparent. Instead we get mostly reminiscences from former residents interspersed with a few comments from a social scientist. There&#39;s certainly no examination of the counterarguments.

The reason I wanted to write this up here is because the film&#39;s central thesis is intriguing in light of our current housing crisis and homelessness problem. I was riding my bike along the Riverfront trails in Pittsburgh last weekend and I noticed that tents lined the path wherever there was room for them. The previous mayor had a lax attitude toward homeless enforcement but this was different; the tents were well-kept and the people living in them didn&#39;t really look homeless. There was no evidence of drinking or drug use other than the occasional beer, and one ten&#39;s door was open and the inside was reasonably organized. It should also be mentioned that vagrancy downtown was a problem during the Peduto administration but it&#39;s not nearly as bad now, so there&#39;s obviously some additional enforcement going on. I found out later that the people living in these tents have housing vouchers from the county nut there&#39;s nowhere to put them, so they were given tents and permission to set them up until they find apartments. For most of my life, I had been inclined to agree with most of the experts, that public housing was a bad idea for all the usual reasons. But if the result of relying on Section 8 and affordable set asides in market-rate developments just leads to a housing shortage, is it really worse than the alternative? Large projects may be bad, but it&#39;s probably better than sleeping on the street. Furthermore, are they inherently bad, or only bad because of mismanagement and failure to deal with vacancies? These are tough questions, but unfortunately, *The Pruitt–Igoe Myth* doesn&#39;t answer them.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikelhsn/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ike8dlh/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Is there any serious argument against a free market in human organs if you&#39;re a </title><updated>2022-08-15T15:43:23Z</updated><author><name>MelodicBerries</name></author><content type="text">Is there any serious argument against a free market in human organs if you&#39;re a libertarian?
