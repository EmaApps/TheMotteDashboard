TLDR: Weinstein had weird deformed genitals, possibly as a result of gangrene[!] which may have lead to amputation of both testicles[!!!]. He also may have been severely impotent, requiring pre-coital injections to maintain an erection. Reportedly the jury saw photos of his genital region during the trial [to confirm testimony], and were visibly disgusted.

I&#39;m torn on the reporting of this and the framing of it as an explanatory factor in his actions. It&#39;s tempting to frame him as a sad man. &#34;Hurt people hurt people.&#34; People reach for these explanations to offer themselves a measure of control. It&#39;s not that rape is a fairly expected outcome of giving men that kind of power and failing to restrain it through social or legal means, or alternatively that we have to cope with the presence of certain evil men in our society, instead it shuffles blame into a nebulous idea that by a series of accidents sometimes there&#39;s a fat guy with an a mean mom who loses his genitals in a freak and happens to have a lot of power over a lot of beautiful women. But that series of accidents isn&#39;t really preventable, it&#39;s just the universe, man.

And it has little explanatory power. Ok Weinstein had weird junk, did Lauer, did Epstein, did Prince Andrew, did Deshaun Watson? Or do they all get their own little just-so story that explains their behavior? When do we come around to actually confronting human nature as it exists rather than blaming the dark sides of it on aberrant chances?

I almost find myself wishing this information hadn&#39;t been published, because it retards progress on understanding rape in our society. It is clearly not the action of a psychotic minority of men, but a predilection that lurks within a significant minority of men and must be managed and prevented by policy and personal choices. Our society has this annoying tendency to say that we understand that anyone might be tempted to steal or kill, but only a sick man would think of rape. Then be shocked when so many men engage in pushing the boundaries of consent. 

The piece tries to take that stance, talking about how it is important to see rapists as people not as monsters. I&#39;d say talking about how his balls rotted off renders him more rather than less monstrous and inhuman and unusual. Less relatable, less normal. We need to confront the fact that there is no just-so story and no magic trick to preventing rape, that it is no different than preventing most crimes which people want to commit.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig7g4dp/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig7axly/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[I wade into](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/what-boston-can-teach-us-about-wh</title><updated>2022-07-15T00:39:30Z</updated><author><name>ymeskhout</name></author><content type="text">[I wade into](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/what-boston-can-teach-us-about-what) the &#34;what is a woman?&#34; debate and write a long post about the topic. My main point is that I think the argument over definitions is a distraction from more productive discussions.

Excerpt: 

Debates over definition boundaries can be a fun conversational frivolity (Are Pop-Tarts a [sandwich](https://twitter.com/matttomic/status/859117370455060481)? Are Algerians [Latino](https://www.reddit.com/r/LatinoPeopleTwitter/comments/nxhiet/latino_alignment_chart/)? Is *Old Town Road* country music? Etc.) but they’re most often deployed with other goals in mind. Arguments over definitions are often disguised queries for something else entirely. In [Yudkowsky’s example](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4FcxgdvdQP45D6Skg/disguised-queries), a factory worker is tasked with sorting blue furry egg-shaped objects (called “bleggs”) from smooth red cubic objects (“rubes”) on an assembly line. This job goes fine until the worker encounters a purple egg and has no idea how to sort it. The worker and his supervisor get distracted by the debate over definitions (Can bleggs be purple? Can rubes be furry?) until the *true* purpose of the sorting job gets revealed: bleggs contain vanadium ore, and rubes contain palladium ore, both of which need to be industrially processed differently. The ore processing plants do not give a fuck what color or shape their supply chain materials are so long as they accomplish the purpose they were built for. The question “Is this a rube or a blegg?” therefore is used as a good enough (and presumably cheaper) way of solving the ultimate (and presumably more complicated) logistical question of “Does this need to be processed by the palladium or the vanadium plant?”. But without a shared understanding from both parties for *why* the distinction matters, no answer will communicate any useful information to whoever is asking. It’ll remain a useless question.

Similarly, [if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7X2j8HAkWdmMoS8PE/disputing-definitions), does it make a *sound*? Another useless question. Both yes and no can be correct answers, depending entirely on whether your definition of sound is “acoustic vibrations” or “perceived auditory sensation”. Without first establishing *why* the distinction between the two definitions matters, no useful response is possible. Here too it’s possible to get infinitely distracted over which definition is the “correct” one, but the purpose of language ultimately is communication, and the more productive avenue would be to acknowledge that it’s helpful for distinct concepts to have distinct words. You can even make up new words (alberzle and bargulum for example) to avoid future confusion.

Sometimes ambiguity is intentional. Was [January 6th](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/the-january-6th-circus) an insurrection? Again, that depends entirely on *why* the distinction matters. The reason this might matter to a federal prosecutor would be maybe to determine whether they should file criminal charges under [18 U.S.C. §2383](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2383). But outside of that niche analysis, it’s reasonable to be suspicious of questions like this because of the serious negative connotations that *insurrection* inevitably conjures up. The question is very likely intended as a cover to ask “Was January 6th a Very Bad Thing™?”. Whoever asking the question then would have an interest *against* establishing a shared understanding for *why* the distinction matters. Because the goal with dishonest questions like is to score points, not gain information.

I am not the first to notice this deceptive practice. Parrhesia wrote about [the word games used](https://parrhesia.substack.com/p/playing-word-games-with-the-woke) in these types of discussions, most blatantly with the word *racism*. In terms of heavyweight champions in the semantic space, *racism* is a sought-after bruiser. It’s a strong word with serious negative connotations, and everyone is eager to use it to bludgeon their opponents. Asking whether something is or isn’t racist is the mother of all disguised queries. The goal here isn’t to gain information, it’s to find out who to bludgeon.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig7axly/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig5l4s9/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">It&#39;s on now: [Twitter sues Elon Musk to enforce original merger agreement](https</title><updated>2022-07-14T17:41:36Z</updated><author><name>greyenlightenment</name></author><content type="text">It&#39;s on now: [Twitter sues Elon Musk to enforce original merger agreement](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/twitter-sues-elon-musk-to-enforce-original-merger-agreement.html)

&amp;gt;The outcome of the dispute could be unpredictable, legal experts say, and could involve a judge forcing Musk to complete the deal or forcing him to pay a $1 billion breakup fee, or other scenarios including a settlement, renegotiation of the purchase price, or even Musk walking away without paying anything.

&amp;gt;Twitter is seeking a four-day trial in September, according to a court filing.

&amp;gt;In the suit filed Tuesday, Twitter argued that Musk’s conduct during his pursuit of the social network was in “bad faith” and accused the Tesla CEO of acting against the deal since “the market started turning.”

Elon seems completely unfazed by the whole thing. His followers do not seem to care either and agree with Elon on the bot excuse/problem.

I have observed that many of the people who opposed the deal 2 month ago at $44 billion on the grounds of Elon being bad for Twitter, now want Elon to be forced to buy Twitter, which strikes me as odd.

https://twitter.com/Scuttlepunk/status/1545541867634319362

As mentioned last week, I think it&#39;s unlikely he will be forced to pay the $44 billion. Either a large fine or buying twitter a discount. If Elon is fined, twitter is goin to have a hell of  a time collecting on it, and likely it will be stalled out.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig5l4s9/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig5etui/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">I want to understand people who honestly believe that a human fetus is not a hum</title><updated>2022-07-14T17:01:34Z</updated><author><name>OracleOutlook</name></author><content type="text">I want to understand people who honestly believe that a human fetus is not a human person of moral weight.  From previous discussions I take that this is most of the people on this forum, and in fact most people on this forum have a hard time understanding someone like me, who believes that all living human organisms have 100% equal moral weight.  

I don&#39;t want to talk about abortion per se, because that gets into bodily autonomy and other moral considerations that muddy the water.  I want to investigate what gives humans moral weight, in the minds of Mottizens.  I devised the following thought experiment and questions to really get into the fine details:

Imagine a mad scientist who created a memory wiping chamber.  An orphaned, friendless adolescent wanders into the chamber and has their mind wiped.  As part of this process, they will be in a helpless coma for a few weeks, followed by a long period of relearning how to eat, walk, and talk.  As I mentioned, no one has a sentimental attachment to the person they were and they will have 0 memories of their previous life.  

1. While they are in the coma, is it morally acceptable to stab them?  Poison them?  Otherwise seek their death?
- If not, would it be ok for the mad scientist to starve them or otherwise not seek to provide medical treatment to keep them alive through their coma?  
- Does this answer change if the coma period extends from a few weeks to a few years?  When is the cutoff period at which it is acceptable to actively kill them or passively refuse aid?  

2. If you say that it&#39;s not ok to kill them and/or it is necessary to render aid given their helpless state, what is it that makes them a human person to you? 
- Is it that they resemble you physically in some respect?
- Is it that they will soon regain the abilities that you think define personhood?
- Is it that they once experienced the abilities that you think define personhood even if there&#39;s no conscious continuity?  
- Something else?

Edit:

A recurring question is what the coma process is like, so to clarify:

The brain is reformatting itself, this is a process that is uninterruptible and will take a long period of time. During this time the brain is not having what we would consider thoughts or experiences, though there is some sort of electrical activity. Electrical activity closer to 8 weeks of gestation than 40 weeks of gestation.  The subject is not light sensitive and not forming memories, for instance.  This process is happening on its own and is certain to complete itself in two weeks as long as the body is kept hydrated.

I also really don&#39;t want to talk about abortion.  Even talking about zygotes/embryos has been getting off topic.  I want to identify what a human person is and how that is different from a living human organism for most Motte people.

So far, the answer I&#39;m getting is a certain amount of gray matter, though it doesn&#39;t depend on if it&#39;s forming a thought.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig5etui/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig4rlyd/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Yglesias: [How Hillary Clinton unleashed the Great Awokening](https://www.slowbo</title><updated>2022-07-14T14:33:32Z</updated><author><name>Stefferi</name></author><content type="text">Yglesias: [How Hillary Clinton unleashed the Great Awokening](https://www.slowboring.com/p/how-hillary-clinton-unleashed-the)

&amp;gt;Part of the issue here is that Democrats have consistently chosen to interpret the fact that Trump is a scumbag as indicating that Trump is an ideological extremist, when these are just different questions. But I think in some ways the bigger and more unconsidered issues have to do with how the 2016 primaries played out. In particular, Clinton got spooked by Bernie Sanders’ stronger-than-expected early showing and decided to respond by outflanking him to the left on social issues. I believe that this backfired and caused Sanders to do better with moderate Democrats than he otherwise would have done and also bolstered his popularity with the general electorate.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;But both Clinton and Sanders seemingly believed that her efforts in this regard were highly effective.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;After the primaries, the Sanders team decided they needed to outflank the establishment by moving even further left on identity issues, and the establishment decided that front-loading identity issues was their ticket to holding an incipient socialist takeover at bay. So while the question in the 2016 primary was something like, “should we move left on identity or on economics?” the answer ended up being, “let’s do both.”

I think this comports with what I observed following, for instance, various Sanders groups in 2016. Sanders started by having, genuinely a bunch of fans who can be described as &#34;Bernie bros&#34; and didn&#39;t have particularly woke views on social issues, even if they probably could be described as generic liberals. Polls showed that Bernie had fans among \*both\* left-wing and moderate Democrats, and served, to some degree at least, as a general stop-Hillary, throw-the-bums-out candidate in the primary; Yglesias fingers Iraq War as the big issue which lessened Hillary&#39;s popularity. Pretty soon Hillary team responded by highlighting social issues (the &#34;Would that end racism?&#34;) speech and, upon losing, Sanders team decided that they must outflank this outflanking in 2020, contributing to a purity spiral.

The title might be wrong, some have stated that the beginning of the &#34;awokening&#34; is in 2012-2013 with Trayvon Martin case and so on, but this doesn&#39;t necessarily conflict with the idea that the 2016 Democratic primary is also a pivotal movement - the 2012-2013 period might have well created the necessary preconditions for the dynamic where the most natural reaction to a challenge is generally trying to outflank the challenger from the left on social issues.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig4rlyd/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1ycv6/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[The Case Against Judicial Review](https://prospect.org/justice/the-case-against</title><updated>2022-07-13T22:45:46Z</updated><author><name>SaxifragetheGreen</name></author><content type="text">[The Case Against Judicial Review](https://prospect.org/justice/the-case-against-judicial-review)

Judicial review, first implemented in Marbury v Madison, is the basis of the powers traditionally held by the Supreme Court. This article goes over the history of it, but I can&#39;t get over the slant. It reads like nothing more nor less than sour grapes. Judicial review is bad because it is leading to bad outcomes today, right now. Starting from the end of the article:

&amp;gt;Under any government, there is always a danger of its power being abused. Democratically elected legislatures are not immune from this problem. It must be admitted that, should Republicans take control of Congress and the White House without any constraint from the Court, there’s a strong chance they’d pass all manner of abusive stuff. The Florida legislature, for example, recently passed a bigoted “don’t say gay” bill that blatantly violates the civil rights of LGBT teachers.

&amp;gt;But the risk of theoretically unconstrained congressional majorities must be set against the current fact of the Court steadily stealing the powers of Congress, eroding the freedom of the people—and, of course, doing nothing to protect gay Florida teachers from a feral state legislature. It’s far from the first time American courts have ignored the Bill of Rights, and it won’t be the last.

Bad outcomes, therefore judicial review is bad now, and while it could be worse in the future, we have to do something now.

From earlier:

&amp;gt;A current or future president, in response to some particularly egregious Supreme Court diktat, would explain their problems with the ruling, and insist that they will not obey the decision. They would say that in their opinion, Marbury v. Madison was wrongly decided, that the Court does not get to claim sole power to interpret the Constitution, and that the Constitution has no stipulation about the U.S. being a judicial dictatorship. From now on, if Congress, for example, directs the president to regulate air pollution, then they will do as instructed, rather than obeying the Court’s wishes.

Of course, we have had prior Presidents who have done exactly this! And what does the article have to say about Old Hickory?

&amp;gt;While challenging the judiciary is commonly associated with Andrew Jackson, the two best presidents in history, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt, had no choice but to directly confront the Court in order to advance justice.

While commonly associated with (bad president) Jackson, it&#39;s also been used by (good presidents) Lincoln and Roosevelt!

Now, I&#39;m no fan of Marbury v Madison. I don&#39;t think judicial review should be as powerful as it is today. But this author barely grapples with the fact that it is a sword that cuts both ways. Without judicial review, you don&#39;t get Brown v Board, you don&#39;t get Roe v Wade, you don&#39;t get Chevron v NRDC, you don&#39;t get Wickard v Filburn. Without judicial review you certainly don&#39;t get the two biggest Left wins in the court in the last decade, Obergefell v Hodges and Bostock v Clayton County. The things being specifically being complained about, West Virginia v EPA and Dobbs v Jackson&#39;s WWH, are themselves reversals of previously enacted judicial review!

So I ask the motte, is judicial review good, or bad? Has it outlived its usefulness, or was it ever useful? And when and how should Marbury v Madison be contested, if at all? I had hoped for a more nuanced take on it, but the article I shared got me thinking.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1ycv6/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1j84r/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">A bit of news that should surprise no one paying attention to social media and i</title><updated>2022-07-13T21:01:48Z</updated><author><name>_Cullis</name></author><content type="text">A bit of news that should surprise no one paying attention to social media and its role in modern society:

Initial reporting only came from an article [sourced to an Indiana doctor who&#39;d had a 10 year old child brought in for an abortion after one was not available in Ohio.](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/health/2022/07/01/indiana-abortion-law-roe-v-wade-overturned-travel/7779936001/)  The story naturally attracted a lot of attention from abortion-rights advocates up to and including [the President.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/08/biden-abortion-10-year-old-rape-victim/)  Given the story&#39;s visceral impact and the general inability of Republican politicians [to defend the policy,](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/03/kristi-noem-abortion-children-00043886) there was a lot of skepticism thrown at the initial reporting.

Most notably, the [attorney general of Ohio](https://www.fox19.com/2022/07/12/not-whisper-evidence-show-10-year-old-ohio-rape-victim-got-abortion-indiana-ag-yost-tells-fox-news/) went on Fox News and claimed the story had no evidence, and the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-abortion-story-too-good-to-confirm-joe-biden-ten-year-old-girl-indiana-ohio-caitlin-bernard-11657648618) called it a &#34;fanciful tale.&#34;

The idea is that eating a diet consistent solely of potatoes will lead to considerable weight loss, and the results are plain to see. [No one gained weight](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ahPd4EygAeEXd2we3MAb5EuX_Wm0sCGBPQ4qYjg6u8iIJF9ppFKh9rO9SQxEzAfTgn-Ts460M6jmjHvf4LOhUuOaEJFXZMD76TUswGpTU8E9K0XmaDEu3ev7O1xU8EX99KkosyQYy9RWuCNVRgU), [mean weight loss was pretty large](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SvOOLFA04BaBzC53ckpT2ZvNuAsnUpDzHltfEGBHUJK-LNvlNErRuTsWiTQS0mxhtHOFqmZHwg3QbOeMhlF6Fz1MXDavpQnlQ18k0iyUUUWGUu_dK7A9hlrNqJEsvSu9Nddehv8lr-Sd1hgk1fw), and [results were reasonably consistent by BMI before the experiment](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/owVbw0OZIQdIiRwq6lRoNtJ0ONOTdFQa5rqEBI41qw68BUqnSvNjKhDnGfe_YtZAaQbyoKDip9eCE_rT-Wm0-dlAkxLcs6BZDtPMXjL_u-ztB1jbubCOorXx-qmD2aOZtW_nq46sgGCEjt5xIKc). SMTM&#39;s post sounds deservedly ecstatic, but it also sounds undeservedly like they think they&#39;ve made a discovery.  
  
Throughout the article, they pepper in comments like &#34;If you predicted (or could have predicted) that the potato diet would cause this kind of weight loss, or if medical / nutritional science could have predicted that this diet was going to be so effective in the short term, and so easy for so many people — then why haven’t doctors and nutritionists been recommending the potato diet to people alongside diet and exercise?&#34; and &#34;We understand if you don’t really get this. We didn’t get it either, despite reading about all the previous success stories, until one of us tried the potato diet for ourselves. Hunger vanishes in a really weird way that is hard to describe to anyone who hasn’t felt it directly. So listen to all our participants who are like “no it’s not calories, it’s not willpower”. Or try it for yourself, you might be surprised!&#34; At a first glance, it&#39;s difficult to imagine someone wrote this with anything like serious intent, and these sorts of quotes are commonplace throughout the blogpost. They stand as solid evidence of virtually complete ignorance of this area of research. I&#39;ll explain by tackling these quotes.  
  
The first one should stand out to SlateStarCodex readers who remember [this review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/25/book-review-the-hungry-brain/) of Stephan Guyenet&#39;s *The Hungry Brain*. At the beginning of Section III, Scott described a very relevant study: &#34;In 1965, some scientists locked people in a room where they could only eat nutrient sludge dispensed from a machine. Even though the volunteers had no idea how many calories the nutrient sludge was, they ate exactly enough to maintain their normal weight, proving the existence of a “sixth sense” for food caloric content. Next, they locked morbidly obese people in the same room. They ended up eating only tiny amounts of the nutrient sludge, one or two hundred calories a day, without feeling any hunger. This proved that their bodies “wanted” to lose the excess weight and preferred to simply live off stored fat once removed from the overly-rewarding food environment. After six months on the sludge, a man who weighed 400 lbs at the start of the experiment was down to 200, without consciously trying to reduce his weight.&#34;   
  
The study in question is amply described in the book and can be read in full [here](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb34828.x) (or [via sci-hub](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb34828.x)). It&#39;s really something, but it&#39;s also not the only study of its type. There have been plenty of studies on single-food diets, both with animals and humans. The general tenor of their results is that restriction to a singular type of food leads to weight loss. People who read *The Hungry Brain* will be unsurprised that sort of work is cited. The authors over at SMTM evidently read Guyenet (he is cited twice in the linked post), but never read his book or they could not have written that first quote. But, we know from their series *A Chemical Hunger* (e.g., [here](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/07/a-chemical-hunger-part-i-mysteries/), [here](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/11/a-chemical-hunger-part-ii-current-theories-of-obesity-are-inadequate/)), that they at least cite *The Hungry Brain*, and even had [a blogpost on this exact study](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/23/a-chemical-hunger-interlude-b-the-nutrient-sludge-diet/). The blogpost is an unimpressive handwaving exercise by way of ignoring the post-1980 research on this topic and dismissing the pre-1980 research with the reason being that results from before the obesity epidemic really kicked off won&#39;t generalize. But this criticism is too broad. In their own potato diet post, they say that they expect their results will generalize, but for some reason, other monotonous diets will not? Perhaps their criticism only applies to this specific 1965 study, although I have doubts since they focus so heavily on potatoes, to the exclusion of general dietary monotony.  
  
Regardless, if you read just a few pages more in *The Hungry Brain*, you will discover (p. 65) where Guyenet predicts the result of a dietary content restriction: &#34;The fact that sensory-specific satiety drives us to overeat suggests a simple solution to the problem: Limit yourself to a few foods.&#34; What is the potato diet but limiting yourself to a few foods? The quantity of research supporting this point is enormous, so their arguing that it wasn&#39;t predicted - when they have evidently read and even written about material predicting it - should be galling for them. The snide remark they make asking why doctors haven&#39;t recommended eating potatoes only serves to obfuscate the reality that it is not potatoes that made the difference here, but induced dietary monotony. (Which is different from cross-sectional dietary monotony, both in terms of causes and effects.) To answer their subsequent quote
  
&amp;gt; If you knew the potato diet would work, why did you not run this study many years ago? Why are there no clinical trials? Did you think people would not be excited to see this result? 

It&#39;s clear that all that needs to be said is &#34;The studies were done, the trials were run, the results were in, you just ignored them.&#34;  
  
The &#34;We understand if you don&#39;t really get this&#34; quote refers to a reduction in hunger with the diet. My best guess about why they &#34;don&#39;t really get this&#34; is that they misunderstand hunger. Firstly, Guyenet explained their result very well, and his perspective is by no means unique. Secondly, hunger [follows a Circadian-like rhythm](https://eje.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eje/152/6/1520845.xml) and is reduced to a pittance when you completely restrict caloric intake. Consistent with this, [ghrelin levels fall when you fast](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/90/2/741/2836628). That is part of the standard explanation why, after a few days of fasting, you suddenly stop feeling any hunger. Even the subreddit /r/fasting [has a FAQ section mentioning this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/wiki/fasting_in_a_nutshell#wiki_5.2._tips_and_tricks). Hunger is similarly reduced by dietary austerity, and more austere diets yield bigger weight losses and less rebounding, but I don&#39;t wish to ramble.  
  
As with the rest of their posts on weight and weight loss, SMTM&#39;s latest comes up short. It ignores things they&#39;ve read, ignores obvious implications, mechanisms, and prior work that should be cited, whilst being replete with generalizability concerns despite failing to acknowledge predictions generalize to cover theories like their own.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig0u4zm/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig0g9km/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">A small update on the Ukraine war front - it appears that the sanctions Lithuani</title><updated>2022-07-13T16:50:11Z</updated><author><name>tricksandcandlewicks</name></author><content type="text">A small update on the Ukraine war front - it appears that the sanctions Lithuania put on Kalingrad are [now facing pressure from an EU commission](https://statefirstnews.com/2022/07/13/update-today-breakingthe-european-commission-today-backed-down-to-russian-threats-and-issued-new-guidelines-saying-sanctions-dont-apply-to-rail-transit-via-lithuania-to-kaliningrad-th/).

I was more surprised that the EU decided to fold that quickly. When they&#39;re already getting Russia to shut down Nord Stream 2 and other pipelines, it makes me wonder what cards are left to play.

While I do find the Ukranian case for war sympathetic, I really don&#39;t get the case for Lithuania poking the bear here. This isn&#39;t even a case of Lithuania building up a military capable of enforcing the regulations it was trying to pass, just taking an opportunity to swipe at the much bigger country next door for unclear reasons.

It&#39;s over 50 mins long, so I will jump right into the most controversial CW part. Basically he raises the hypothetical question whether A) the West is degenerate and B) if it is, does that potentially justify or at least *explain* why Putin may have acted in Ukraine to forestall its assimiliation to [GAE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oVkne9WgpY)? 

An outraged left-wing activist has [cut out](https://mobile.twitter.com/thebadstats/status/1546327272780472321) the most relevant part. Peterson first answers the question regarding whether or not the West is degenerate. His answer is clearly yes. 

He then moves to the second part, and speculates that in his view, Putin could indeed have calculated that if did not invade then Ukraine would have become assimilated to GAE and thus lost forever.

Naturally, Peterson is being slammed online as a &#39;Putin shill&#39; and a Russian stooge etc, but the questions he raises are valid. Perhaps we are seeing an element of the culture war actually &#34;going hot&#34;. 

It&#39;s said that the 20th century was a fight between liberalism, fascism and communism.

A quick synopsis of the facts as we know them currently (subject to additional information and corrections, of course). 

1: Female subject with small daughter in tow attempts to purchase a number of items at a bodega, but her EBT card is declined. The clerk (M/61)runs the card a couple times, then declines the sale. When he gathers the items, the woman begins shouting that he assaulted her daughter, that he &#34;snatched&#34; a bag of chips from her etc. Unclear from video angle. 

2: Female subject threatens bodega clerk that she will go get her &#34;N\*\*ger&#34; and &#34;fuck you \[him\] up&#34;. 

3: Female subject retrieves her boyfriend, a 35-yo ex con with north of 25 arrests, including multiple arrests for assault and reportedly on parole from an assaulting-a-cop beef.

4: Female and male subjects return to the bodega and initiate first a verbal confrontation, followed by the boyfriend coming behind the counter and assaulting the clerk. The clerk stabs the boyfriend several times, and the girlfriend follows them behind the counter and stabs the clerk three times (exact timeline unclear). Boyfriend dies, clerk&#39;s wounds are superficial. 

5: NY prosecutors charge the clerk with second degree murder, do not charge the woman at all. They ask for $500,000 bond, the judge gives them a quarter mil bond. Later, under public pressure, the bond is reduced to $50k and enough money is raised to get the wounded clerk out of Rikers. 

6: Current status is the clerk has become a local [cause celebre](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/11/us/new-york-bodega-stabbing-murder-charges/index.html), but is still facing a second-degree murder rap. The woman who initiated every stage of the conflict and stabbed the clerk remains free of arrest and charges entirely. 

As I&#39;ve said many times before, I&#39;ve lived through this news cycle before. The swing in criminal justice public policy exemplified by BLM and the sort of reforms pushed by the rationalist community (among many others) very quickly started resulting in these sorts of issues. It&#39;s a sort of microcosm of systemic failure of the justice system. It combines outrageous social behavior, aggressive violence, the intentional policy of keeping violent criminals free, and swift punishment for the victims of violent crime who dare to defend themselves. 

This is, in my view, the inevitable result of the reheated 1970&#39;s policies we are currently implementing in many major cities. When criminals are considered the victims, it is citizens who are the &#34;perpetrators&#34;. Basic anarcho-tyranny. This is the criminal justice system currently being adopted, and if allowed to fully mature, we will probably see the same sort of crime wave we did in the &#39;70s and &#39;80s, complete with the economic hollowing-out of major cities, a civilian population that will get scared and start arming itself, and a criminal population that will explode when they fully realize that the only people doing time are the ones resisting them.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifzejpk/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifz3f8z/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">I just have to return to a [two-weeks-old](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/com</title><updated>2022-07-13T10:32:20Z</updated><author><name>Stefferi</name></author><content type="text">I just have to return to a [two-weeks-old](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vlopk0/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_june_27_2022/ie5imbr/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3) thread on vaccines and birth rates collapsing in many countries, since it just struck me (after reading some other discussions about it, admittedly) that it&#39;s quite odd neither me or the other posters considered one very obvious explanation: it&#39;s the vaccinations!

...and by that I mean not the vaccines themselves, but the vaccination process; at least in Finland, the local authorities [explicitly recommended](https://yle-fi.translate.goog/uutiset/3-11750453?_x_tr_sl=fi&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=fi&amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp) that women avoid pregnancy for two months (note: for some reason Google Translate translates it as a &#34;couple of months&#34;, but Finnish text talks about two months) after vaccination. I&#39;m not sure whether other countries had similar recommendations, but I&#39;d imagine at least some did.

Of course, the &#34;birth gaps&#34; noted are longer than two months, but similar recommendations might generally make people get antsy about the prospect of pregnancy, and so might the fact that even people who get vaccinated might well encounter a lot of antivaxx posts about the dangers of vaccination and pregnancy and thus be less willing to get pregnant. Who knows, something like that might ironically create a permanent effect \*even if\* it turns out the vaccine itself does not create major pregnancy risks.

Is there any info about various countries and their official vaccination/pregnancy recommendations, or any other way to test this?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifz3f8z/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifyt7j4/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Small culture war snippet:

Hence, polemics

I am always surprised by the rhetoric used in these cases, because the main defence from the progressives left is &#34;why we should care about this when we have the economy to care about?&#34;

Mind you, this tactic of &#34;but the economy?&#34; is probably the most used ever by every political side in history, but my point is another:
Is difficult to conserve your face if, suddenly, gender affirmation and the cultural war on it become a very trivial and stupid debate to do if the right do it, while at the same time is a topic that save literally lives if it is not done


How it is possible? The cultural war about gender is one of the main engines of the left today, but suddenly is trivial if the enemy does the same and debate on it? We are supposed to believe that, at the same time, is a stupid issue to die on but it literally save thousands of lives?

And I&#39;m not saying in this post that there are no good arguments about capitalism, I&#39;m only trying to understand the *modal* argument against capitalism.

I think people inherently don&#39;t like being told what to do. When someone compels you to do something, chances are it benefits them more than it benefits you, so we have an automatic reflex to assume that we&#39;re being shortchanged.

The weird thing is, when you look around at modern society, there&#39;s no one entity that really tells you what to do. If you don&#39;t like your job, you can quit at any time and no one will make you keep working. But then, if you don&#39;t have any job, you&#39;ll probably have to live on the street and that&#39;s not pleasant, so if you want to live a normal life you&#39;ll have to find *someone* who has money and convince them to give it to you.

The system that coordinates this is capitalism, so indirectly, the market forces of capitalism are telling everyone what to do. That inherently makes people dislike it, I think. You can ask yourself &#34;why am I doing something I hate every day?&#34; and trace the causal chain back and eventually you&#39;ll get to &#34;because capitalism&#34;. That&#39;s probably not going to endear someone to capitalism!

People won&#39;t say it explicitly, and it feels like of strawmannish to say out loud, but I genuinely think maybe 50% people who say things like &#34;fuck capitalism&#34; are imagining in their heads &#34;Capitalism makes everyone have to do stuff they hate all day and most people don&#39;t even get paid that much money for it. Wouldn&#39;t it be great if there were a system where nobody had to work and we still had our modern living standards?&#34;

Through this lens, a lot of arguments that seemed weird to me started to make sense.

1. The subreddit /r/antiwork. Enough said I think. Some people say that their real goal is just &#34;workplace reform&#34; or something like that, but I think that&#39;s just the motte. 
2. [Leftie youtube PhilTube made a video about &#34;bullshit jobs&#34;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_X-812q_Jc). If you&#39;re not familiar, [bullshit jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) says that half of all work people do in the developed world is pointless. If you look at his examples, like &#34;programmers repairing bloated code&#34;, I think you&#39;ll find this assertion a bit questionable. But you can understand why it&#39;s a very tempting idea: if half of jobs are completely pointless, that means everyone could work 20 hours a week instead of 40 with no loss in productivity! 
3. There&#39;s of course the preference for small businesses over megacorps. When a mom and pop shop hires you to work the register, that&#39;s not capitalism making you do it, that&#39;s just mom and pop asking you to do something for them and paying you for your time. They&#39;re probably giving you a good deal, right? But when Amazon hires you to work in the warehouse, even if they pay better than mom and pop and offer better benefits, suddenly is some weird foreign global system that&#39;s getting you to work for them. They&#39;re probably ripping you off!

Again, to be clear, I&#39;m not saying there are no good arguments against capitalism or anything like that. I think it&#39;s okay to look at bad arguments for position X, as long as you don&#39;t come away from that process thinking that those are representative of the best arguments for position X.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifvc3ol/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifu5vwr/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">In the UK the Tories are having a new leadership election.

For one reason or another a lot of minority candidates are in the race and people are talking about it. Much of it is presented as a reply to lawyer, full time virtue signalling tweeter, and [fox killer](https://barristerblogger.com/2019/12/26/should-jolyon-maugham-be-prosecuted-for-bludgeoning-a-fox-to-death/) Jolyon Maugham.

[This article](https://www.thenational.scot/news/20267870.jolyon-maugham-sparks-racism-debate-deleted-tweet-sunak/) covers the origin. 

[Of course the Conservative Party could choose an ethnic minority leader](https://capx.co/of-course-the-conservative-party-could-choose-an-ethnic-minority-leader/) says Sunder Katwala

&amp;gt; That ethnic minorities can reach the top of the political ladder matters – but it would certainly not make either Britain or the Conservative party a post-racial nirvana. While it will take more to shift the Conservatives’ share of the ethnic minority vote, the leadership contest sends a powerful symbolic message about the race to the top. The next challenge will be to develop the substantive agenda to deliver on that promise.

[In a more humourous article about poorly air conditioned leadership speeches](https://archive.ph/8pIpT#selection-1559.0-1559.144) Tim Stanley remarks 

&amp;gt; Actually, I think historians will write that the two notable things about this race were, one, it was incredibly diverse and, two, nobody cared.

Rakib Eshan says [The left’s problem with diversity](https://www.spiked-online.com/2022/07/11/the-lefts-problem-with-diversity/)

&amp;gt; The left’s unhealthy obsession with racial identity and ethnic heritage can only do more harm than good. Treating ethnic-minority people not as individuals but as representatives of ethnic groups will only undermine our multi-ethnic democracy.

&amp;gt; Beyond the identitarian game-playing, Britain is grappling with myriad social and economic problems. From the cost-of-living crisis to the endless backlogs in the NHS, the Tories have left numerous open goals for the opposition. The classic conservative message, that family stability and hard work can insulate people from harsh economic conditions, sounds tin-eared at best amid the current crises. These are the bread-and-butter domestic issues that Tory leadership candidates should be challenged on. But instead, the Conservatives’ opponents have been reduced to race-baiting playground behaviour.

Tomiwa Owolade writes for the New Statesman [It’s absurd to say the Conservative Party isn’t ready for a non-white leader](https://www.newstatesman.com/quickfire/2022/07/its-absurd-to-say-the-conservative-party-isnt-ready-for-a-non-white-leader)

&amp;gt; But the third and most pressing point is this: why shouldn’t an ethnic minority person be a Conservative? If we accept that not all ethnic minority people are the same – which should be the first plank of anti-racism – then we have to accept that they do not all share the same political perspective. And nor should they. Political pluralism should be staunchly defended: it is as important an element of diversity as any other.

--------------------

I&#39;d sum up the whole debate like this:

* The left know the Tories are doing better than Labour on diversity at the top so they&#39;re keeping quiet.
* The right don&#39;t care that much, and are mostly talking about taxes and cost of living. (Except Kemi Badenoch whose mostly talking about free speech and culture) But are willing to take a bit of a victory lap to indulge themselves. 
* While everyone writing about this topic is by definition engaging in culture wars. I think you can say that people who mention the fox are more tribal than people who don&#39;t.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifu5vwr/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/iftd8wr/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[Noah Smith on how Shinzo Abe is not the man the West paints him to be.](https:/</title><updated>2022-07-12T03:56:00Z</updated><author><name>CD-ROM_INSTRUCTOR</name></author><content type="text">[Noah Smith on how Shinzo Abe is not the man the West paints him to be.](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/abe-shinzo-a-retrospective) Some excerpts:

**Economic Policy**

&amp;gt;But most important of all was the shift in the economic role of women. Before Abe, Japan had persistently lagged in terms of women’s labor force participation, especially among mothers. The country’s sexism was legendary and entrenched. When Abe came to power at the end of 2012, I definitely did not expect him to change this — during his brief, abortive first tenure as PM, his health minister caused a national scandal by referring to women as “birth-giving machines”. Abe’s reputation as a staunch cultural conservative seemed to presage more business-as-usual.  
But it was not business-as-usual. As soon as he got into office for the second time, Abe began to talk up the importance of women in the workforce, and to implement some real policies toward this end as well. By 2014, it was clear to me that the national dialogue around the issue had shifted.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The key number we were all keeping an eye on here was women’s labor force participation, which surpassed the number for the United States for the first time in 2017.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;So on macroeconomic policy and structural reform, Abe really delivered in a way that I didn’t expect him to. And the results were clear — falling unemployment despite a flood of new workers into the labor force, record profits for small and medium sized businesses, and modestly rising incomes despite rapid aging and a growth in the old-age dependency ratio.

**Surprisingly Liberal**

&amp;gt;But by the second time Abe took power, his approach had changed. Abe visited Yasukuni Shrine — where the ashes of several Japanese war criminals are kept — once at the beginning of his term in office, but did not do so afterwards. This was in contrast to his mentor Koizumi Junichiro, who had made annual visits when he was Prime Minister in the 2000s. That was the first hint that Abe was behaving in a less overtly nationalist manner in his second term.  
In 2015, Abe reversed his previous denialist stance on the issue of Korean “comfort women” (WW2-era sex slaves), issuing a formal apology and explicitly laying the blame on the Japanese military for the first time.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;...  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;But Abe’s most liberal actions came in an area that’s not (yet) a hot-button issue in Japan — immigration. Under Abe, Japan opened itself up to immigration in a way that it never has before, with a “guest worker” program that offered a path to permanent residence, and a fast-track permanent residency program for skilled workers. The number of foreigners living and working and settling down in Japan soared.  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;The anti-racist wave that beat back the racists online was present in the real world too — anti-racist counter-protesters showed up to shout down the hateful Zaitokukai, usually outnumbering them by a huge margin. Of course, Abe doesn’t get credit for that activism, but unlike Donald Trump — who spent a lot of time attacking “antifa” and ran cover for racist demonstrators — Abe and his administration focused on cracking down on the racists. That kind of leadership makes a difference.  
On almost every issue of race and nationhood, therefore, Abe — in his second term — behaved as the polar opposite of Donald Trump. He opened up his country to immigration, tourism, and trade, apologized for past misdeeds, made overtures to old enemies, and cracked down on racism.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/iftd8wr/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifs4qa3/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[deleted]</title><updated>2022-07-11T22:18:40Z</updated><author><name>[deleted]</name></author><content type="text">[deleted]</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifs4qa3/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifrq463/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">In Poland, government decided to create a new school subject for high schools, &#34;</title><updated>2022-07-11T20:42:52Z</updated><author><name>Sinity</name></author><content type="text">In Poland, government decided to create a new school subject for high schools, &#34;History and Present [time]&#34;.

===

(I&#39;ve translated it and dumped onto pastebin); some excerpts below:

Objectives

&amp;gt; 1. In the aspect of attitude to the truth: the acquisition of reliable knowledge of the most important cultural, political, social and economic changes in Poland and the world after 1945 up to the present - and in this context obtaining an understanding of the main issues of social life, politics and law, as well as knowledge of the immediate origins and nature of the great problems of the modern world.
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt; 2. in the aspect of attitude towards the good: to prepare the student for an independent and fair assessment of the said changes taking place in Poland and in the world since the end of World War II in terms of continuity and change (or rupture) in relation to the foundations from which our Homeland grows, understood as a community shaped according to specific cultural norms and visions of man, family and society dating back to the classical Greco-Roman civilization and Christianity.
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt; 3. in the aspect of attitude to life: acquiring an inquisitive interest in collective life, readiness to personally undertake social tasks and civic involvement in the spirit of patriotism as a wise love of the homeland formed in the tradition of the Republic, through the practice of individual and social virtues, as well as through the discovery of the harmony of rights and duties, freedom and responsibility, human happiness and the development of human communities, and the importance of just laws and prudent policies.

Some specific requirements

The left and the right have both recently used this slogan, and interestingly enough, have argued their points in almost exactly the same way down four levels of argument.

**Abortion**

- Left: When it comes to abortion, my body my choice. The government must respect my bodily autonomy and my right to make choices about my own body.
- Right: But it’s not just about your body. There is a child developing inside of you who also has rights, and the government must respect their bodily autonomy too.
- Left: It&#39;s not a real child, it doesn’t substantially have the ability to experience or think. Even ignoring my right to privacy, I have the right to avoid a life-changing nine month pregnancy which could see me dead or disabled because of it, and I would also be consenting to the onerous duty of having to raise and support the child for at least eighteen years, and in the case of an otherwise healthy child with Down Syndrome, in perpetuity.
- Right: Well, how about adoption instead?

**Vaccine**

- Right: When it comes to the vaccine, my body my choice. The government must respect my bodily autonomy and my right to make choices about my own body.
- Left: But it’s not just about your body. There is a community of people breathing around you who also have rights, and the government must respect their bodily autonomy too.
- Right: It&#39;s not a real vaccine, it doesn’t substantially prevent transmission. Even ignoring my right to privacy, I have the right to avoid a life-changing shot which could see me dead or disabled because of it, and I would be consenting to the onerous duty of having to show the government and private companies my vaccine cards with all required boosters in perpetuity.
- Left: Well, how about lockdowns instead?

EDIT: Well, it looks like I found a nigh-perfect [scissor statement](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/). Although I have opinions on both topics, I was inspired to post this simply by how closely the arguments are mirrored.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifqh42h/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifpphsh/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">We talked quite a bit about the quality of information in the media ecosystem an</title><updated>2022-07-11T12:20:02Z</updated><author><name>Walterodim79</name></author><content type="text">We talked quite a bit about the quality of information in the media ecosystem and how that has intersected with science of questionable quality in the Covid universe, but today I want to highlight an example that&#39;s generally a bit further from the culture war. Over the weekend, my NYT digest pinged me with the now one year old wellness article *[Do We Really Need to Take 10,000 Steps a Day for Our Health?](https://archive.ph/Xq0Fv#selection-319.0-322.0)*. As someone that&#39;s immediately triggered by people looking for excuses to justify their sedentary lifestyles, I naturally clicked through for a quick rage-read (put aside for a moment how unhealthy *that* behavior is). So, what&#39;s the origin of the claim that fewer steps is actually fine?

&amp;gt;A 2019 study by Dr. Lee and her colleagues found that women in their 70s who managed as few as 4,400 steps a day reduced their risk of premature death by about 40 percent, compared to women completing 2,700 or fewer steps a day. The risks for early death continued to drop among the women walking more than 5,000 steps a day, but benefits plateaued at about 7,500 daily steps. In other words, older women who completed fewer than half of the mythic 10,000 daily steps tended to live substantially longer than those who covered even less ground.

Wait, *what*? How does this causal inference chain work? If you showed me [that study](https://archive.ph/3Xcuo), I&#39;d think it&#39;s fine as far as it goes, but that the only thing that it really tells us is that elderly women that have dropped to as few as 2,700 steps are often pretty well on death&#39;s door, which is what I would have already expected. There&#39;s pretty much nothing I can draw from that regarding the value of moving more for young and middle-aged people. There definitely isn&#39;t anything strong enough to move me off the prior that moving more is almost always a good thing. I suppose I agree that there&#39;s no magic number and if there was, it&#39;d be a hell of a coincidence that it happened to line up with a shiny, round number, but that&#39;s never really been the point anyway. Oh well though, she&#39;s not done citing evidence:

&amp;gt;Another, more expansive study last year of almost 5,000 middle-aged men and women of various ethnicities likewise found that 10,000 steps a day are not a requirement for longevity. In that study, people who walked for about 8,000 steps a day were half as likely to die prematurely from heart disease or any other cause as those who accumulated 4,000 steps a day. The statistical benefits of additional steps were slight, meaning it did not hurt people to amass more daily steps, up to and beyond the 10,000-steps mark. But the extra steps did not provide much additional protection against dying young, either.

Well, that&#39;s a bit more encouraging, so [what does that study say](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2763292)? 

&amp;gt;A total of 4840 participants (mean age, 56.8 years; 2435 [54%] women; 1732 [36%] individuals with obesity) wore accelerometers for a mean of 5.7 days for a mean of 14.4 hours per day. The mean number of steps per day was 9124. There were 1165 deaths over a mean 10.1 years of follow-up, including 406 CVD and 283 cancer deaths. The unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality was 76.7 per 1000 person-years (419 deaths) for the 655 individuals who took less than 4000 steps per day; 21.4 per 1000 person-years (488 deaths) for the 1727 individuals who took 4000 to 7999 steps per day; 6.9 per 1000 person-years (176 deaths) for the 1539 individuals who took 8000 to 11 999 steps per day; and 4.8 per 1000 person-years (82 deaths) for the 919 individuals who took at least 12 000 steps per day. Compared with taking 4000 steps per day, taking 8000 steps per day was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.44-0.55]), as was taking 12 000 steps per day (HR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.28-0.45]). Unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality by peak 30 cadence was 32.9 per 1000 person-years (406 deaths) for the 1080 individuals who took 18.5 to 56.0 steps per minute; 12.6 per 1000 person-years (207 deaths) for the 1153 individuals who took 56.1 to 69.2 steps per minute; 6.8 per 1000 person-years (124 deaths) for the 1074 individuals who took 69.3 to 82.8 steps per minute; and 5.3 per 1000 person-years (108 deaths) for the 1037 individuals who took 82.9 to 149.5 steps per minute. Greater step intensity was not significantly associated with lower mortality after adjustment for total steps per day (eg, highest vs lowest quartile of peak 30 cadence: HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.65-1.27]; P value for trend = .34).

OK, this is actually pretty good. It&#39;s still more in the direction of predictive data than advice (IMO), but those differences are *really* large. We should be looking at that and describing dropping to 4,000 steps per day in middle age as an emergency, a strong predictor of impending doom. This doesn&#39;t necessarily provide advice for the young, but we can probably start drawing some inferences about just how bad it is to not move around much. Of note, the 12,000 step group actually did a decent bit better than the 8,000 step group; they have overlapping confidence intervals, so that&#39;s a weak conclusion, but I&#39;d personally be inclined to take it as a suggestion that we don&#39;t really have any cap on the &#34;more is better&#34; line of thinking. What&#39;s the conclusion from our intrepid NYT reporter?

&amp;gt;The good news is that upping our current step counts by even a few thousand additional strides most days could be a reasonable, sufficient — and achievable — goal, Dr. Lee said. The formal physical activity guidelines issued by the United States and other governments use time, not steps, as a recommendation, and suggest we exercise for at least 150 minutes a week, or a half-hour most days, in addition to any moving around we do as part of our normal, daily lives. Translated into step counts, Dr. Lee said, that total would work out to a little more than 16,000 steps a week of exercise for most people, or about 2,000 to 3,000 steps most days. (Two thousand steps equal approximately a mile.) If, like many people, we currently take about 5,000 steps a day during the course of everyday activities like shopping and housework, adding the extra 2,000 to 3,000 steps would take us to a total of between 7,000 and 8,000 steps most days, which, Dr. Lee said, seems to be the step-count sweet spot.

Wait, *what*? How is that the &#34;sweet spot&#34;? Is this based on the idea that it&#39;s some unbearable suffering to go for a long walk? I&#39;m just absolutely blown away that anyone would treat 10,000 steps as (implied above) unreasonable and unachievable. Just how low of a bar are we setting and why is that the tone that a NYT blogger wants to set for people?

On one level, I know I&#39;m being petty, but I actually do think misunderstanding causality and failing to actually look at the data in a couple pretty simple papers highlights just how bad science and medical journalism is. It&#39;s not just politically charged topics like Covid and environmentalism, it&#39;s something as simple as, &#34;should people be advised to take more than 8,000 steps?&#34;. When the writing is this bad on something that I wouldn&#39;t expect bias to creep in, I find that I&#39;m unsurprised that it goes completely off the rails on topics where there&#39;s a tribal affiliation with morally good conclusions.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ifpphsh/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
