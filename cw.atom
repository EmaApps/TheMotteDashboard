We have a dev site at https://www.dev.themotte.org/. I strongly encourage you to make an account and test stuff out. Change settings, try to break it, make sure it works how you&#39;d expect it to. Can you find problems? Please find problems! Report them here, or at the, uh, dammit, I don&#39;t trust Reddit to not filter this. Report them at the repo on https://github.com/themotte that says it&#39;s for the website. If they&#39;re sensitive for some reason, feel free to PM me.

The standard posting rules do apply, with the major exception of the low-effort rule. Low-effort posts are still disallowed, but no-effort posts are explicitly allowed! Post Lorem Ipsum! Post the bee movie script! Write &#34;I am a fish&#34; 400 times! Go wild! Obviously this is a dev-site-only change, this is just to make it easier to test stuff.

If you want to join the dev team, [it&#39;s over here](https://discord.gg/KChpcdaNJC). I cannot emphasize this enough: *this would not be happening if it wasn&#39;t for our volunteers*. They are great. I seriously need to put a Credits page on the site, I haven&#39;t done that yet, but I will. Thank you!

Again, please report any issues you run into, from site-breaking issues to mild inconveniences; every bit of info is useful. I can always triage minor things down, but if I don&#39;t know about them, they won&#39;t ever get fixed.

I&#39;ve been thinking about how the discussion about AI art ca</title><updated>2022-08-19T00:12:59Z</updated><author><name>Primaprimaprima</name></author><content type="text">**Do you like AI?**

I&#39;ve been thinking about how the discussion about AI art can be linked back to the culture war, since that is our *raison d&#39;Ãªtre*.

Most of the discussion here has focused on the object-level issues concerning AI art: the economic impact to artists, the projected rate of progression of the technology, etc.  What I&#39;m interested in here, though, is the psychological profiles of the participants in the debate.  It&#39;s clear to me that there are people who *like AI*, and there are people who *don&#39;t like AI*.  That is, regardless of your object-level beliefs about the inevitability of the development of the technology, or how many jobs it will displace, or what potential benefits it may bring to society and culture at large, people tend to enter the debate with a preexisting positive or negative emotional affect towards the concept of AI itself.  Some people are happy that the technology exists; some are not.

What causes someone to join one group or the other?  What sorts of underlying beliefs and values are at play here?  What patterns can we observe?

To make things clear up front, I *don&#39;t like* AI, and I especially don&#39;t like AI art, so part of the analysis will inevitably take place from that point of view, although I ultimately hope to touch on the underlying psychological motivations of both groups.

Let&#39;s dispose of some of the simple and obvious explanations first: the idea, for example, that the only people worried about AI art are artists who are afraid of losing their jobs, and any other sane person should be happy to reap the rewards of increasingly democratized access to the means of cultural production.  I can&#39;t object to this idea from an *entirely* neutral point of view, since drawing and painting are more tied to my identity than they are for the average person, but I can still object to it from a semi-objective point of view.  I have no musical ability whatsoever, nor do I have any interest in ever developing any, but I still don&#39;t like AI music.  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s been years at this point since I first heard about AI composing pieces in the style of Bach and Beethoven, and I didn&#39;t like that stuff when I first heard about it either.  It rubs me the wrong way.

Nor can opposition to AI be reduced to simple technological luddism, or a knee-jerk preference for what is familiar over what is new and unfamiliar.  I am not opposed to all technological progress on principle - I welcome the advent of interstellar travel, and the curing of diseases like cancer and ALS.  Conversely, I am skeptical of technologies that have been a familiar part of my life since childhood.  I can hardly remember a time when I didn&#39;t have access to the internet, and yet my feelings towards it are mixed at best.  It&#39;s a double edged sword - it has brought many great things, but also many terrible things.  If I could somehow freeze publicly-available internet access at a level of development comparable to the late 90s, I probably would.  But that&#39;s another story.

It&#39;s not hard to enumerate factors that I *incidentally* find distasteful about AI art - that it will flood the world with a glut of low-effort content, that it will inflate the egos of people who think they are &#34;artists&#34; when they are in fact nothing of the sort, that it will discourage people from developing genuine creativity because it will be easier to settle for a half-hearted, inauthentic substitute - but I think that none of these considerations truly strike at the heart of the issue for me.  My intuition is that there is something deeper going on, something that can be related to the culture war, because I think I can see familiar patterns from the culture war repeating themselves.

My highly speculative thesis is that people who like AI are motivated by an *aesthetics of success*, and people who don&#39;t like AI are motivated by an *aesthetics of failure*, or a tragic aesthetics.  These positions also correspond in a very loose way to the left/right divide, respectively.  I&#39;ll try to explain what I mean.

Traditionally, leftism since Marx was founded in a belief in utopian progress - that we could resolve social problems through willful, rational action, ultimately culminating in a terminal optimal social order that was free of contradictions, or as Marx put it, &#34;the riddle of history solved&#34;.  Now, it&#39;s possible to claim that modern (or even classic) leftism is not about this at all, and that it&#39;s actually a thinly disguised form of ethnic warfare.  That may be true.  But even so, you can&#39;t deny that this utopian impulse did exist in and continues to inform leftism, and more importantly, people who *enjoy* this vision of the future, people who find it *aesthetically* pleasing, people who hear the idea of an optimal non-contradictory social order and think &#34;hey that sounds like a good idea&#34;, tend to be drawn to leftism.

The same utopian impulse from Marxism also underlies the transhumanism of, for example, Yudkowsky&#39;s [Fun Theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K4aGvLnHvYgX9pZHS/the-fun-theory-sequence).  The idea (as far as I can tell from lightly skimming it) is that we could construct a perfect reality that satisfies every constraint we could ever wish to optimize for - it&#39;s exactly as exciting as we need, exactly as pleasant as we need, exactly as challenging as we need, and if for some reason you wish to meet a tragic end where you fail to fulfill all your goals, well hey we can arrange for that too.  It is logically perfect in every way - no one is excluded, no one could ask for more, even the people whose very wish is to be excluded from the utopia.  I think the relation between this kind of transhumanism on the one hand, and the development of AI on the other, is pretty obvious - if you enjoy, on an aesthetic level, the idea of a perfect transhumanist future, then you probably also enjoy on an aesthetic level when AI smashes through fundamental human limitations.

I am *in no way* saying that everyone who gets warm fuzzies for AI and transhumanism is a leftist.  Certainly we have many counterexamples on this forum.  Nor does every leftist like the idea of AI - there are plenty of leftist artists complaining on twitter about AI art as we speak.  But I do think that leftists and people who like AI are aligned on this general pro-utopian axis - they agree that a utopian future is fundamentally desirable, even if they disagree on implementation details, and many other contemporary political issues besides.

The key thing to understand about the other side, the opposition to this utopian ideal, is that *not everyone thinks that utopia is desirable*.  Some of us consciously reject it.  I mean this in a very deep way, as deep as you can possibly conceive.  I mean that even in the most logically perfect utopia you can imagine, one where everyone gets the exact amount of challenge and pain and tragedy that is suited to them, one where I can live in my tragic broken reality and you can live in your blissful nice one and we can somehow coexist simultaneously - *I still don&#39;t want that*.  I don&#39;t want reality to be like that.  I don&#39;t want reality to be at peace.  I want there to be failure in the very nature of things.  I want us to never reach a final state of peace, even if there is fire and brimstone built into that overarching peace.

From Zizek&#39;s &#34;Less Than Nothing&#34;:

&amp;gt;It is true that one finds in Hegel a systematic drive to cover everything, to propose an account of all phenomena in the universe in their essential structure; but this drive does not mean that Hegel strives to locate every phenomenon within a harmonious global edifice; on the contrary, the point of dialectical analysis is to demonstrate how every phenomenon, everything that happens, fails in its own way, implies a crack, antagonism, imbalance, in its very heart.  Hegel&#39;s gaze upon reality is that of a Roentgen apparatus which sees in everything that is alive the traces of its future death.

I find this to be an immensely aesthetically pleasing passage - it&#39;s how I want reality to be.  I imagine that transhumanists will not feel as warmly towards it (although this is an empirical hypothesis that is subject to refutation through counterexamples).  To you, there is beauty in triumph; problems are meant to be solved, and then quietly and safely set aside, conquered, dealt with.  You want to [resolve on the I chord](https://youtu.be/6aezSL_GvZA?t=430).  We won, you say; there&#39;s no need to go backwards now.  Man stands victorious at the summit of his knowledge.  You thought we couldn&#39;t make a machine that paints beautiful pictures?  Well, we did it.  We put the sum total of man&#39;s visual knowledge into a machine.  That&#39;s what we were able to accomplish; our triumph over this domain is total.  The beauty of our actions is measured by the strength of the gods we have slain.

To me, there is beauty in failure - no problem ever fully solved, no debate ever put to rest, no point of finality ever reached.  Not because there is an angry God who will slap us down if we exceed our station, but because *failure is built into the very nature of things*.  The moment of triumph becomes the moment of defeat, not due to any external force, but because of the necessity of its own inner movement.  Reality as a demonic house of mirrors where every moment of recognition is the moment of misrecognition, every realization comes too late that the act of will was actually the ultimate act of self-sabotage - this is reality as I *aesthetically* want it to be.  Doesn&#39;t mean it is.  But it&#39;s what I want - it&#39;s what I like.  And our likes and dislikes are awfully important when it comes to motivating our actions.

Hopefully there&#39;s something here to discuss.

&amp;gt;Out of love for mankind... I conceived it as my task to create difficulties everywhere.

I was listening to a podcast which interviewed a parent about social emotional learning in their school. She believes that it&#39;s a form of mind control. Does anyone know that much about the subject and its flaws/strengths?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikv9b16/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikutiu1/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[Guessing C For Every Answer Is Now Enough To Pass The New York State Algebra Ex</title><updated>2022-08-18T22:16:58Z</updated><author><name>Tarnstellung</name></author><content type="text">[Guessing C For Every Answer Is Now Enough To Pass The New York State Algebra Exam](https://medium.com/@newyorkteacher/guessing-c-for-every-answer-is-now-enough-to-pass-the-new-york-state-algebra-exam-93bac55b3e24)

&amp;gt;He wasnât even present in my classroom for most of three marking periods. At the end of the year, he asked me how he was supposed to pass the state test.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;âNo problem,â I said. âJust pick all Cs.â
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;âWhat?â
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;âTry it. I bet it will work.â
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;It worked.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; (...)
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;This problem has a clear solution: make the algebra exam an exam that actually tests a studentâs ability to do algebra.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;Unfortunately, this solution is difficult to implement. Implementation is difficult because of all the reasons that drove NYSED off the cliffs of insanity in the first place. Look at the incentives. NYSED and local school districts have large financial incentives to graduate as many students as possible. These incentives were put in place by both federal and state legislators who meant well and were trying to encourage good public school performance (good performance == graduation, of course, in their eyes). Teachers and principals have large quality-of-life incentives to pass students. Failing students brings scrutiny, parent and student complaints, superintendent pressure, guidance counselor inquisitions, paperwork, and meeting after meeting. Itâs much easier to pass everyone.

TL;DR: The criteria on an exam needed to graduate from high school in New York have been lowered to the point that it can be passed by someone who barely attended class.

I first saw this on /r/slatestarcodex. In [the comments](https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/wro3vz/guessing_c_for_every_answer_is_now_enough_to_pass), someone asked why the SAT wasn&#39;t more widely used by universities and employers, given that it is more standardized and objective. A discussion concerning this question would probably move in a &#34;culture war&#34; direction; hence, this post.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikutiu1/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/iktra5n/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Sam Harris finally just says the quiet part out loud with respect to how it appe</title><updated>2022-08-18T18:14:04Z</updated><author><name>rokosbasilica</name></author><content type="text">Sam Harris finally just says the quiet part out loud with respect to how it appears a lot of democrats feel about Trump and the importance of the democratic process: https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1560257627237539845

&#34;It doesn&#39;t answer the people who say it&#39;s completely unfair to have not looked at the laptop in a timely way and to have shut down, you know, the NYpost&#39;s twitter account.  Like that&#39;s just a left wing conspiracy to deny the presidency to Donald Trump.  Absolutely it is, and I think it was warranted.&#34;

The podcast hosts press him on this, and he does admit that actually, yes, it is completely fine to suspend the idea of democracy simply to prevent Trump from getting the presidency, because he believes that Trump is a big enough threat that this is warranted.  The comparison he makes is to an asteroid heading for earth that will destroy all life on this planet, and that in that case you would do *anything* to stop it.

I think to anybody who has been paying attention to politics for the last two years, and especially to anybody who has spent much time looking at the 2020 election, this sort of thing won&#39;t be surprising.  My question to people who are still of the mind that the left isn&#39;t pushing us towards a less democratic society is: do you agree with what Sam is saying here?  Like for instance: would it be okay to cheat, or to suspend democratic norms to prevent Trump from winning again?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/iktra5n/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/iktljtx/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Quick check: has the sub just been put into that delayed mode where you can only</title><updated>2022-08-18T17:36:53Z</updated><author><name>Navalgazer420XX</name></author><content type="text">Quick check: has the sub just been put into that delayed mode where you can only see new comments in [the feed](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/) for the first 10 minutes?

C</title><updated>2022-08-18T14:53:34Z</updated><author><name>Stefferi</name></author><content type="text">**Culture war in Finland: Stupidest day in Finnish politics for a long time**

CONTEXT: It&#39;s not a new thing that Finnish PM Sanna Marin, 36, has been frequently seen out and about, drinking and dancing in clubs and such. Of course it&#39;s not a new thing for Finnish politicians to use alcohol or even get into accidents and such while doing so, but this is the new era and everyone has smartphones.

Previously the [major affair was in December](https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-finlands-prime-minister-sanna-marin-apologises-for-going-clubbing-after-coronavirus-exposure-12490903), when she was out late in a Helsinki club even though she had been exposed to Covid and there were still Covid restrictions for various things; even though the restrictions didn&#39;t affect what she, specifically, was doing, it was considered improper. On these evenings she&#39;s been spotted with an entourage of local pop stars and other celebs.

Anyway, last week, she was at one of the major music festivals in Finland, Flow Festival - not the biggest, but a classic hipster festival and certainly &#34;upscale&#34; - and had pics taken [with the attending celebs](https://is.mediadelivery.fi/img/468/7089604209104a472752cf1aa503aeb2.jpg). This caused some tut-tutting about behaving immaturely during great crises in Europe and the world. Whatever.

Now it turns out that one of the members of her entourage took a [video of being a drunk party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C-djV-ptEM) with her entourage and posted it on IG - private account for 92 people, to be sure, but of course something like that&#39;s going to get out. The video started spreading yesterday, and the entirety of today has consisted on Finnish social and traditional media obsessing about the clip, specifically about the specific charges of whether her entourage uses cocaine.

Of course PM partying in an entourage that&#39;s on drugs would be scandal in other countries, too, whether they took coke personally or not, but Finland tends to currently be particularly conservative on drugs compared to other Western countries - even pot decriminalization is not really soemthing that most would be consider to be short-term achievable.

Hard drugs are, of course a whole other question. I haven&#39;t used anything stronger than pot in my life and it&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve even smoked, but my understanding is that coke has been a facet of celebrity life at some level. However, it&#39;s only recent years when it has really hit the scene in Helsinki. Usually, the hard drug of choice for Finns has been speed.

Now, none of the celebrities are actually snorting anything up their nose in the video, so what&#39;s the evidence for drug use? Well, apart from the fact that they&#39;re, ya know, smiling and having fun and so on in the video (Finns might drink alcohol, but we do it to get drunk, not to actually have fun), at some parts of the video, some of them shout &#34;Fuck it, this makes me feel good&#34; in reference to something unseen and the word that might be &#34;jauhojengi&#34; (&#34;flour gang&#34;) or something else. Also, some claim that some of the pixels in the video indeed make it look like there&#39;s coke on the table. (Others claim it&#39;s a phone.) One particular claim is even that people on the video must be on drugs since there are so few bottles or glasses seen.

&#34;Flour gang&#34; has instantly became a meme here, even though it&#39;s now unclear 1. whether &#34;flour&#34; is actually Finnish drug lingo, or whether it has ever been used to refer to powder drugs here by anyone and 2. whether the words &#34;jauhojengi&#34; are actually used - the video features people dancing to and singing washed-up pop rapper Petri NygÃ¥rd&#39;s lyrics for the old hit song &#34;SelvÃ¤ pÃ¤ivÃ¤&#34; (&#34;Sober day&#34;), which is about, as you might guess, drinking. (You can find [translated lyrics](https://lyricstranslate.com/en/selv%C3%A4-p%C3%A4iv%C3%A4-sober1-day.html) here if you really wish.) The word heard as &#34;jauho&#34; might well instead be a reference to &#34;jallu&#34;, or Jaloviina, an iconic Finnish booze brand that&#39;s 50 % brandy and 50 % vodka and features in a metric ton of local music.

Several medias took the whole &#34;flour gang&#34; thing and ran with it, probably one reason being that earlier in the week they were criticized for going too easy on Marin and her government. Now others are attacking media for pushing a theory originally spread (at least on Twitter) by conspiracy theorist accounts that have otherwise taken a pro-Russian narratie. Yes, there are even references to whole thing being a Russian disinfo campaign.

Marin has herself [had to comment on this](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-finnish-pm-sanna-marin-says-no-drugs-just-lots-of-dancing-at-wild/), saying that she is disappointed in the video leaking, that she only had mild alcoholic drinks and doesn&#39;t use drugs and that she&#39;s willing to even take a drug test (not that it would show cocaine use anyway, more than a few days having passed from the party). Of course it still might turn out one or more of the celeb entourage members have been on drugs, who knows?

All in all, it would probably be the best if the PM quit back on partying or at least chose better friends to avoid embarassing stuff leaking out (also, you know, for general security reasons), the first rule of the Flour Gang is to never talk about the Flour Gang, PMs should find better music to dance to than a local whiteboy 50 Cent and politics here can indeed be as dumb as anywhere else, especially with the social media and stuff.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikswpuv/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/iksffji/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Would it be good idea to have regular &#34;practical life advice&#34; thread like &#34;welln</title><updated>2022-08-18T12:52:05Z</updated><author><name>Eetan</name></author><content type="text">Would it be good idea to have regular &#34;practical life advice&#34; thread like &#34;wellness wendesday&#34; is for health and fitness?

Does it exist? Are there multiple types? Is it several different concepts that are conflated? Can people have different amounts of empathy? Can empathy be turned off on purpose? These are but a small sampling of the questions I&#39;ve asked myself, and I don&#39;t have answers. I don&#39;t know what empathy is, but I know 1. I have less of it than most people do, if I even have it at all and 2. a lot of people have empathy only when it&#39;s convenient. I waffle on whether people in my outgroup/people whose outgroup includes me are particularly unempathetic, or whether my cognitive bias just makes me think that they are.

I&#39;ve tried to understand this concept of empathy not because I think it&#39;s important to understand, but because the word &#34;empathy&#34; gets tossed around a lot and I&#39;d like to know how to interpret it. Maybe it&#39;s one of those words like &#34;racism&#34; or &#34;woke&#34; that has no precise definition and is, at best, a direction.

As a rule, I don&#39;t like seeing people suffer. However, when someone is suffering, I cannot say I feel their pain, because I&#39;m not them. I only know what it&#39;s like to be me and have the particular experiences that I&#39;ve had. The closest I can get to putting myself in the place of another person is thinking back to an experience I&#39;ve had that made me feel a certain way and acting as though that&#39;s exactly how my interlocutor feels. That&#39;s not empathy, but an approximation. The way people describe empathy makes it sound like a superpower, like mind reading. But people often act as though they can read minds (hence the concept of dog whistles), so maybe this is all one big LARP too?

I was lurking on r/ThePurplePill and I saw [this comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/wr2ls0/people_need_to_stop_saying_men_are_lonely_because/ikrjnql?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share&amp;amp;context=3) that approximates my feelings on humanity and the phony concept of empathy.

Sorry if this comes off as rambly. Basically, I&#39;m asking for a &#34;CMV: empathy isn&#39;t real&#34; or &#34;ELI5: What is empathy?&#34; I&#39;m not going to those subs, though, because I trust The Motte more than either of them.

It seems the Republican voters are committed to enforcing party loyalty to Trump, and now Cheney will either have run to the Democrats or accept she no longer has a voice in the party.

This combined with the recent FBI probe on Trump&#39;s home, and the confirmation of the incident in &#39;the Beast&#39; make Trump seem only further like the best candidate for the GOP.

This is a fairly interesting omission from the forum in its own right as this forum has at least traditionally had a strong SF Tech overlap. 

But for those who didn&#39;t get the story, Tornado cash is a new Smart Contract that is intended to obscure the block-chain addresses used in transactions by bundling them together to obfuscate any single transaction. The US Treasury blacklisted the coin blacklisted and declared it illegal for Americans to own or use following it being used to funnel money to North Korea [see: https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1558129960140816384#m, https://www.pcmag.com/news/tornado-cash-developer-arrested-as-blacklisted-crypto-site-goes-down, https://www.foxbusiness.com/financials/dutch-authorities-arrest-suspected-developer-tornado-cash-platform-launder-billions]. 

Dutch authorities (Pertsev is Dutch) have claimed to have an independent investigation and the arrest was for concealing criminal financial flows and money laundering on behalf of the Dutch prosecutor&#39;s office. [https://nitter.net/sccanavos/status/1559530518043148290#m]

This obviously has many developers in arms. Tornado Cash was VC backed and worked to follow the law [https://nitter.net/jonst0kes/status/1558196851169452034#m, https://nitter.net/dystopiabreaker/status/1558196263190876161#m]

Inflammatory title I know, but that&#39;s how traffic works these days. I beg forgiveness on that.

The article basically analyzes the conservative claim on social media from last week that the 87,000 tax collectors in the Inflation Reduction Act would be used to attack poor people. While the maps seem to indicate that, and further seem more specifically to be targeting *non-white people*, the truth of the matter is more nuanced. The audits are disproportionately attacking folks who file the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) due presumptively to some systemic flagging mechanism within the IRS. And since that&#39;s a measure specifically for poor people, their audits also predominantly hit poor people.

Part of this has to do with changes in staffing. They have more low grade &#34;tax examiners&#34; and fewer higher grade &#34;revenue agents,&#34; and the examiners are largely issuing &#34;correspondence audits&#34; which are simpler things which basically just demand more information. But since they&#39;re demanding them from poorer folks who may not have all the information or understand the cryptic language the correspondence audits are issued in, targeting them pumps the enforcement numbers up and makes the auditors look good.

So now if we set that on a shelf and examine one of the more popular definitions of &#34;systemic racism&#34; (Socioeconomic and government systems which produce differential racial outcomes) then it is apparent that the IRS&#39;s EITC flagging criteria are a result of a &#34;racist system&#34; because it fits the definition in use.

Whether this provision within the Inflation Reduction Act itself then qualifies as &#34;racist&#34; will in the end depend on whether the $80 billion earmark in the law includes a way to fix the racist system, or whether it will just be thrown at increasing operations as they currently exist, in which case the EITC audits will just increase.

I mean, anedoctically, a big percenteage of my acquiantances vote left only for that reason, also if they do not agree at all economically or politically with them (and are completely straight so they have no skin in the game) 

Real quotes:
&#34;I think that their economic policy is stupid, but I vote them for DDL Zan (a failed law on discrimination in Italy)&#34;
&#34; I hate them because they are not too left wing, but they support lgbt&#34;

I think</title><updated>2022-08-16T17:45:29Z</updated><author><name>Texas_Rockets</name></author><content type="text">I&#39;ve noticed an interesting shift among the progressive movement lately. I think there&#39;s starting to be a recognition that the fervor and policies born in 2020 were fairly flawed, as evidenced by the legacy of ideas like defund the police, and elections in fairly left areas in which people rejected the progressive candidates in places like NYC, NJ, VA, and SF (the [SF one](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/chesa-boudin-recall-san-francisco-crime/629907/) in particular is interesting. Chesa Boudin really served as a microcosm of progressivism who was given free reign, as were the city council elections that took place around the same time, thus his election served to some extent as a referendum on progressivism).

But what&#39;s interesting is that progressives, in self reflecting and having to analyze why this has occurred, have blamed progressive white people. And to a considerable degree the same thing has been occurring with respect to the policies corporations instituted during 2020. Which is so crazy to me. On the one hand, I agree and find overeducated white progressives who come from wealthy families to be among the most insufferable demographics. But on the other, their only real crime is that they listened to what was being demanded of them, that they be allies and use their supposed privilege to advance the views of anti-racists. It&#39;s kind of like they&#39;re being told &#34;Lol you thought we were serious with all of that stuff? What the fuck is wrong with you?&#34; It sort of validates the view that anti-racists have anti-white undercurrents. Like if they did unambiguously have anti-white undercurrents, how would they respond to the recognition of the ideological excesses of 2020? They would blame white people. Like if youâre a white progressive and want to support movements and ideas like that, at this point I donât know what the fuck youâre supposed to do. If you donât support it youâre part of the problem as identified by people you agree with, and if you do support it youâre going to be the scape goat when shit goes south and it becomes clear that the policies you supported to advance the ends you were told to advance were deeply flawed.

I think it also reveals a lack of strategy on the part of people working to advance those ideas, even within their own paradigm. Their view is that white people wield disproportionately more institutional power than non-white people do, so if thatâs true you would want those people with outsized power and who agree with you to use that power to advance your ends. But instead they are condemning them and de-incentivizing their participation. It just seems very counterintuitive.

I think it really comes down to the fact that activists are insatiable. when theyâre actually given the reins, asked what exactly they want, and allowed to implement policies, they donât actually know. or if they do have proposals it&#39;s always impractically radical stuff that only makes sense to the small group of people who agree with them like just razing institutions and starting over or defunding the police or something equally as bizzare. it reminds me a lot of the occupy wall street people. Theyâre the dog that caught the car. They arenât there to actually catch the car, theyâre there to chase the car. implementing the change that they desire requires an understanding of things as they are (you have to understand the problem before you can develop a solution), but activistsâ characteristic commitment to ideology precludes them from interpreting the world or developing solutions that go even a bit outside the scope of their ideology. Like can anyone seriously envision a series of events and policies that would have caused BLM to be like &#39;welp. that&#39;s pretty much what we were asking for. you did it and solved the problem. guess we can just pack up our shit and go home.&#39; like even over the course of their ideas being implemented over 10 years I can&#39;t envision that occurring. 

Progressive activists are the dog that caught the car, and once they caught the car and fucked it away they blamed it on the person who served as the distraction that slowed the car down and opened the door for the dog to do what it wanted to do. I think this is indicative of intellectual rot and my view is that to some extent the movement has been exposed and they sorta blew it when they had the spotlight.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikjpzhs/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikiyxbg/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Front Lines in Culture War: Diversity in Policing

I attend town hall meetings in my neighborhood pretty regularly. There&#39;s a new guy who started showing up, and most of his input is focused around &#34;why aren&#39;t you hiring enough minority police?&#34; Because identity matters, he&#39;s a white male in his 30s.

I notice a distinct lack of charity on my end towards his position. The jumping to conclusions are arguments you might have seen before: &#34;He probably doesn&#39;t know any himself, who is he to talk?&#34;, &#34;He&#39;s probably not helping any apply, why isn&#39;t he doing the work to solve this?&#34;, &#34;Who is this White Knight, and why is he expecting other people to do the heavy lifting?&#34; &#34;He probably doesn&#39;t want any people he knows to be police anyway. Does he want to make mental room to be secretly racist, but have plausible deniability because they&#39;re cops?&#34;

The last one, of course, is a terrible conclusion. But it&#39;s still a thought I had, and TBH is also a comment I&#39;d expect someone else to post here. I&#39;m not happy about assuming the worst of him. That he is a sneaky fucker, Literally Hitler In Sheep&#39;s Clothing.

The obvious solution is to find time to take him aside &amp;amp; ask him the questions I&#39;ve had in my head. What steps to take after then, though?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikiyxbg/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikie0e8/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Haven&#39;t noticed an example of this before- in a Spiderman game just ported from </title><updated>2022-08-16T12:24:15Z</updated><author><name>_Cullis</name></author><content type="text">Haven&#39;t noticed an example of this before- in a Spiderman game just ported from PS5 to PC, someone made a mod that replaced flags referring to [our civic religion](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/08/gay-rites-are-civil-rites/)\*  with flags referring to the previous [civic religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_religion).

I did, however, find [this post](https://the-grey-tribe.tumblr.com/post/676558263243997184/there-are-too-many-video-games) arguing about a [Jeff Vogel article](https://bottomfeeder.substack.com/p/there-are-too-many-video-games) about there being too many indie video games.

Leaving aside the...very debateable mertits of said article, this reinforced something that I&#39;ve been thinking about today: is there too much *everything?*

To lay out the life of a modern Western person: there is practically-infinite entertainment to be found, and little worthy work to apply oneself to. Decades ago, supposedly, there were jobs that one could take pride in or even enjoy, and you had to take what you could get for entertainment. Today, there&#39;s so many video games, YouTube videos, TV shows, movies, Twitch livestreams, books, music, and so on to consume. Hundreds of thousands of people are constantly adding onto this pile of information, not to mention a lot the good stuff that came before is still accessible today. This sounds like the end part of Metal Gear Solid 2, which outlines a vision of informational overload, civilizational senesence brought on from the halting of traditional informational eugenics. MGS2 was said to have predicted the Internet&#39;s impact and social media, but I feel that this issue of [monumentality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwGKqiOyIAM), of living in a world with vastly more information than you could ever hope to consume in your lifetime, would not have been forestalled in a world without social media or internet forums.

There&#39;s also the dismal material aspects to consider. The world&#39;s population is somewhere just north of 8 billion, every grocery store is stocked with food products engineered for mass-producibility and cheapness at the cost of other desirable factors, and every person&#39;s estimated impact on politics or productivity is likely so infitesimal as to not matter at all. It seems like getting any job more complex or higher-paying than a burger-flipper or Amazon warehouse worker is a competition where luck is as much of a factor as merit or credentials. On one hand, there are going to be a lot of people who are going to be eliminated from the job market by automation. On the other hand, there may not be enough money to support so many people with welfare. On the third hand, however, the US is no stranger to playing funny games with the nominal numbers of dollar bills that are sent into &#34;the wild.&#34;

Maybe this is just the painful transition period, the growing pains. Perhaps in the future, we will deftly handle these problems brought about by the monumentality of civilization: every job that is too competitive or unrewarding now will be automated, every person will be provided for, and maybe, just maybe, we can still forage *meaning* out of life. Maybe some catastrophe will burn through the forest of human civilization and free up slack in the system (but that&#39;s a big maybe, assuming said catastrophe doesn&#39;t make things so bad that we can never recover). Or maybe things just continue onwards and the human race blindly enters into the biggest rat race of all.

Maybe this is all just my own particular anxieties. I&#39;m more of an artist, I don&#39;t code, and while I&#39;m no stranger to lifting a finger for a job, a fair bit of that was sweeping floors and washing dishes at college. Vogel complains about potholes in his article, but what is there to do when you have no hope of making it as neither an artist nor a road worker?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikhznez/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikgw9wl/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">What do you think the effect of zero code automation will have on employment in </title><updated>2022-08-16T02:31:29Z</updated><author><name>AlternativeEvent2584</name></author><content type="text">What do you think the effect of zero code automation will have on employment in the future? I&#39;m talking about companies like Appian (who someone I know from my CS program works at) or Microsoft&#39;s power platform. I&#39;m more familiar with the latter, but from playing around with it, it seems like it will allow non-coders to essentially automate everything themselves. For example, at my own job we&#39;re doing a little trial where we&#39;re basically trying out one of our departments automating away the need for temps. This MS Power Platform can create GUIs, connect to SQL databases, write to SharePoint, work with APIs, and many other things. So the goal is to essentially have this department automate this and see if we can get it all working. 

If we can, then temps will essentially be gone. And this is only going to get better as time goes on. Furthermore, it will eliminate the need for a bunch of our sys admins because we&#39;re currently moving everything to Azure/365 so they will have nothing to manage.

If zero code works, this might invert the current view of everything being eliminated by coders and instead subject matter experts in accounting or whatever will do the automating themselves even though they can&#39;t code. The top level coders at places like Microsoft will automate away the need for low level coders and sys admins and then they will just collect on those Power Platform E5 licenses. 

I&#39;m new to this as of a few weeks ago so I could be completely off here.

*A few jumbled thoughts, rearranged into Linear Ilfortese B on the advice of /u/f3zinker.*  

With the beta rollout of Stable Diffusion (previously [shilled here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij9ge8b/)), digital artists [have finally taken notice](https://mobile.twitter.com/arvalis/status/1558623545374023680) of text-to-image models, and particularly their ability to imitate individual, modern stylesË1Â . It seems artists have abruptly phase-transitioned en masse from naysaying to fear and rage, and have promptly shut down @StableDiffusion acc with malicious reporting, in what may eventually be recorded in history books as one of the opening shots in the inevitable Neo-Luddite backlash transcending industries and political tribes. (Additionally: fresh HN discussion of [copyright infringement in AI art](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32436203), of [Stable Diffusion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32471199).) 

The gnashing of teeth, gloating, motivated reasoning, [politruk-level understanding of art itself](https://mobile.twitter.com/senfflasche/status/1559311057310580736), [political allies](https://twitter.com/AmandaTNStevens/status/1557766146920783873/retweets/with_comments) and amusing narcissism ([Â«The tiniest cock I draw has more soul than what an AI could spit outÂ»](https://twitter.com/Rattfood/status/1559007094598246402)) are all exactly what I&#39;ve had in mind when saying that I don&#39;t like artists as a class of people and welcome their impending professional decimation by AI (a take [which invited some opposition](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijoupt6/)). Of course they&#39;ll fight back. Going beyond Twitter antics, they voice a somewhat reasonable hope for class action lawsuits and encouragement of broader regulation. Artists naturally can have power in excess of their SES, and they love to flex it. Probably it can work, if the powers that be see utility to facilitating their crusade. And maybe (returning to my constant concerns) we&#39;ll see this used as a *casus belli* for a huge push for prohibition of general-purpose compute in private hands (embraced by Lesswrongian AI alarmists and EAs, and Bostrom-WEF technocratic goons). And AI art will be reduced to some gimped alternatives like cloud-only Adobe Photoshop with $5.99 monthly fee for Â«in the style of James GurneyÂ» meta-brush, with royalties to James or his publisher or estate.Ë2   

Then again, maybe it&#39;ll fall through. Torrents are still here. And good luck regulating away secure comms like Matrix or Briar or, hell, PGP emails. And Stable Diffusion checkpoints are already being spread around, and a rig with four second-hand 3090s from bankrupt Ethereum miners will be enough for *a great deal* of inference. Most importantly, there&#39;s enough interestË3 . Like [Emad says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ2QtKcK2dA) in the recent excellent interviewË4, billions of people are *creatively constipated* and they want to let it all out. This may not be singularity yet, but it&#39;s a classical [revolutionary situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_situation). To wit, the case where preservation of status quo would require drastic changes tearing away at its other aspects, introducing unsustainable runaway processes.Ë5  

The question is, *how* does this continue? Images are of course the least of our problems. Emad can&#39;t wait to automate all forms of media production, and the market will do the rest for Â«normalÂ» jobs. Savvier artists are, predictably given their socialist leanings but IMO very rationally, advocating [for basic income](https://twitter.com/basicincomecdn/status/1557374154478964737). Alas, it&#39;s not that good, and it may not be the lowest-effort adaptation of our society as it grapples with runaway optimization processes.Ë6 And beyond that, there are direct AI risks, both existential due to alignment failure (which I&#39;m skeptical about) and ones obvious from human history. But even for art alone, consider these asinine outcomes: 

- Neuralink-powered DRM: content-as-a-service streamed directly into the brain, with per-qualia billing, data interpretable only on this individual human connectome (connectome Â«keysÂ» owned by Neuralink Corporation, accessed by streaming services through an API), with extreme financial and medical ramifications of tinkering. Episodic memory wiping for extra [dystopian flavor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFe9wiDfb0E) (but you keep your ratings, reviews and habits!). For extra [Cheems mindset](https://normielisation.substack.com/p/cheems-mindset): ID-locked screens/output devices with always-online perceptive hash tracking of all consoomable content.  
- Actual anarchy wiping out incentives for professional artistic work. The culture up to 2022 compressed into language to summon combinations, endless Age of the Feuilleton that Hesse adumbrated in his *The Glass Bead Game*. No more innovative one-upmanship of starving artists who sink decades into grokking the craft and exploring its rabbit holes, just Â«X trending on artstation 8KÂ» forever.

It&#39;s a failure of imagination to go for those. But the status quo can&#39;t continue. [The defaults don&#39;t work.](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/the-defaults-dont-work/) We need to up the learning rate to guess at the future. 

Importantly, what will happen with ideology inherent in contemporary art? Emad promises to train custom models for companies like Sony and Nintendo, and I suppose those will be very good (and if Stability.ai fails, eventually Sony will do it on their own or buy something from a startup or FAANG). But there probably are diminishing returns to the effect of raw quality and quantity on how compelling art feels.  
If you can crank out CalArts style cartoons (assuming people like that style *per se*) with right-wing talking points, and Disney or Netflix animators will do the same but 3x better with their stale propaganda of [embracing monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Beast_(2022_film)), will it matter a lot? Memes with crudely drawn pepes and chads are viral enough; indie games and Minecraft are insanely successful. The Last Of Us II was, I think, [a vessel for Druckmann&#39;s politics](https://collider.com/last-of-us-2-joel-death-neil-druckmann/), and it didn&#39;t persuade people a great deal (on the other hand, people still cite the sophomoric critique of libertarianism in Bioshock, brought to you by Ken Levine, so that depends on specifics). if Druckmann and Levine have the equivalent of Unreal Engine 6 with [automatic generation of arbitrary assets and most code](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/2/23287173/ai-image-generation-art-midjourney-multiverse-interview-david-holz), and Zorba and his friend have the equivalent of mere UE 4 with the same properties, downgraded â will it matter that the former duo has access to AAA tier promotion and the latter just go on Steam and get word-of-mouth fame? 

Finally, will artistry, Â«styleÂ», *stylization* itself survive when it&#39;s not scarce? Will it advance to its llimits?Ë7 Or will the people, surfeited with it, cast away gimmicks and choose simple, beautiful, ecologically valid naturalism with well-told archetypal stories? Or on the contrary, decide that Apple was right and legible schematics that are easy on the mind are the best â art fading away much like the adolescent Android modding and ricing of desktops?  Will it shard into tiny niche superstimuli, or will generic ones be quickly discovered? How will this play together with VR, Metaverse and its private equivalents, and generational churn? 

I honestly have no idea.

Situation remains the same as last week, no major changes. Russia continues to advance at an extremally slow place where they have concentrated artillery, Ukraine continues to attempt to will a counteroffensive into existence through spiral energy.

That said:

Igor Girkin get&#39;s arrested trying to enter the donbas illegally to fight on the front lines. While I, personally, think he is a huge piece of shit it is admirable that he will put his money where his mouth is. 

Russia reportedly  transferring some of their equivalent to training battalions to the conflict areas. This should add some spine to their infantry, and add some offensive teeth to their forces.

On the Ukrainian side:

A Russian airbase in Crimea exploded due to a dropped Lucky Strike. No aerospace equipment was damaged in the massive fireball, according to Russia. Arial photography later confirms at least 6 su-24s and 3(?) su-30s(?) destroyed. The airstrip remains intact, as far as anyone knows. 

In addition, Ukraine has claimed (with iffy visual evidence) to have rendered the Antonivsky and Kakhovka(Man, I don&#39;t know. Languages are hard) bridges unusable for vehicle traffic. Observers have reported fuel and ammunition shortages in Kherson consistent with two blown bridges, but we wont know for sure for a couple days/weeks.

Ukraine claims these strikes were caried out by purely indigenous systems; missle-fuckers think it might be a Hiluxized Neptune antiship missile retrofitted to hit land targets (bridges), which are a type of ship if you think hard enough.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

War remains slow and steady; with predicted russian counter-counter-offensives in the south, and Kherson continues to be the biggest &#39;pocket&#39; since the korean war if it ever actually happens.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikgj8k4/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikg3ior/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">So, if ya&#39;ll wanna feel some second hand embarrassment, watch the Jim Acosta int</title><updated>2022-08-15T23:01:06Z</updated><author><name>dblackdrake</name></author><content type="text">So, if ya&#39;ll wanna feel some second hand embarrassment, watch the Jim Acosta interview with Andrew Yang re. the forward party, featuring lines straight out of the [Simpsons](https://youtu.be/HqjhHVUzl8o) such as

&amp;gt;âI personally think that womenâs reproductive rights are fundamental human rights, but the Forward Party has a, not left or right, but forward stance on even the most divisive and contentious issues,â

First of all, this caused me emotional trauma as a dude who was on the technocratic yang train back when he seemed like a going concern, before he had enough exposure to prove he had no idea what the fuck he was doing politically. I still think his heart is in the right place, but even if I were Hugo Chaves I wouldn&#39;t put him into an office where he would have to try to negotiate any sort of real compromise. 

Second, it makes me wish we could lock every elected official and candidate in a room with a non-hostile but also non-friendly interviewer and not let them out until they have committed to all their positions and defended them at least a bit.

Finally, this further confirms my bias re Centrism and how it either impossible in practice or a contradiction in terms; that if you somehow founded a third party in the US it could do nothing but add another pole.

For those who aren&#39;t familiar, here&#39;s a rundown: Prior to WWII, most urban poor (minorities in particular) lived in overcrowded tenement housing. This was privately-owned, market-rate housing, but conditions were considered substandard at the time and are unthinkable now. A lot of the apartments lacked windows or any kind of ventilation, most units had shared bathrooms, and some still relied on outhouses (in the city) into the 1950s. A lot of the stuff that would easily fail a code inspection now was par for the course. Conditions were crowded to the point that, as one woman recalls, her mother had to sleep in the kitchen as they had to fit 12 people into a 3 room apartment. 

Following the War, there was an increased drive to move tenement-dwellers into modern apartments. This drive had actually started prior to the War, but gained increased impetus when the Housing Act of 1949 made Federal money available to construct housing projects. Throughout the &#39;20s and &#39;30s, the modernist architecture movement had provided a blueprint of how the ideal city should look, and city planners took full advantage of these architects when money became available to put their plans into action. (A detailed description of modern architectural principles is beyond the scope of this post, but if you&#39;re unfamiliar, look up Corbusier to get an idea of what we&#39;re dealing with). 

At first, the project was deemed a smashing success. The design won awards. Early residents talked about how, for the first time in their lives, they were living somewhere where everything was new, and clean, and there was adequate space. On woman said she felt like she was moving into a high-end resort. Another, who was a child at the time, talked about moving in around Christmas, with the moon shining off the snow and lights in every window, and how it felt magical, like they&#39;d finally escaped the slums.

Needless to say, this feeling didn&#39;t last. Within a few years, the place was in noticeable decline, and within ten, it was practically hell on earth. Maintenance issues, exacerbated by vandalism, added danger and seediness. Vacancy rates were high, leading entire buildings to eventually be abandoned, some of which were taken over by drug gangs. Robbery and rape were common in the now unlit stairwells and in the vast expanses between buildings residents entering to complex from the outside had to negotiate to get to their apartments. Security was lax, and police and other emergency personnel were reluctant to respond to calls for fear of their own safety. While an activist organization was able to form to seek redress for these issues, social cohesion was otherwise low, as most law-abiding residents felt unsafe outside their apartments. Throughout the city and nationwide, Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis became a metaphor for everything that was wrong with the inner-city.

In 1968, the activist group staged a rent strike to force the housing authority to address the maintenance and safety issues. The authority, who had for years blamed these issues on lack of funding, asked how they could address any of them if they were starved of the one funding source they could rely on. But the residents had only seen things worsen over the years and wondered what they were paying for. Eventually, the city caved, and rent was capped at 25% of income and there was a commitment to address the maintenance issues. This victory was short-lived, however, as cold air getting in through broken windows that had not been fixed caused water lines to freeze and flood the remaining occupied buildings. At this point, just 15 years after opening, the project was deemed a lost cause, and the remaining residents were slowly relocated elsewhere. In 1972, the project was closed permanently, and all the buildings were demolished by 1976. 

Art critics and historians often point to the day in 1972 that the first set of buildings were imploded as &#34;the day modernism died&#34;. The contention is that the high-minded principles espoused by Le Corbusier and others had been proven empirically incorrect by what PruittâIgoe and other, similar high-rise projects had become. This new generation of critics could cite a laundry list of fallacious assumptions that the modernists had made, and, after all, you could tell just by looking at places like Brasilia and Le Corbusier&#39;s designs for a new Paris that these weren&#39;t places anyone would want to live. The modernists were designing for an idealized version of man, and accordingly ended up disregarding basic human needs. Thus we get living space that is too small, outdoor promenades and piazzas that nobody really uses for anything, etc. On a more straightforward note, social scientists argue that it&#39;s simply a bad idea to put large numbers of struggling people all in one large building, as these projects end up breeding all kinds of horrible pathologies. 

As you may have guessed, *The PruittâIgoe Myth* fights back against these assumptions. The main thrust of their argument is that complaining about the architecture completely ignores the socioeconomic and demographic factors that led to the most immediate problems. The Federal Housing Act provided money for construction, but not for maintenance; it was assumed that maintenance costs would be paid for out of rents. However, the project had been built based on projections that the population of St. Louis would rise over the coming decades. The population of the city itself ended up decreasing from a high of 850,000 in 1950 to only about 620,000 in 1970, fueled by increasing suburbanization. Accordingly, the project had a high vacancy rate from day one, and the money the housing authority was relying on for maintenance never materialized. As the maintenance backlog increased and the city population decreased, the budget went into a death spiral from which it couldn&#39;t recover. Meanwhile, a declining population meant that housing in more desirable areas was becoming available at low prices, so the project, which was originally intended to be a mix of low and middle income residents, ended up only attracting those who had nowhere else to go. It also touches on ancillary issues like racism, lack of policing, Federal housing policy, etc., but it doesn&#39;t go into them in too great of detail. 

Does it succeed in making its thesis? Sort of. The theory is plausible on its face, and it certainly explains why the project failed so soon. The problem is that similar projects were tried in practically every major American city, and there isn&#39;t one anyone can point to as a success. Some of these places did last well into the 2000s, but the film doesn&#39;t examine any of them to see if their problems were due to similar factors. Anecdotally speaking, Pittsburgh&#39;s housing projects supposedly didn&#39;t get bad until the mid-&#39;80s, but this is coming from residents and not statistics. Again, these problems were also supposedly exacerbated by lack of maintenance, so it&#39;s hard to say whether the producers of the film are on to something. One crucial distinction here, though, is that most of Pittsburgh&#39;s housing projects are and were low rises, and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any correlation between how bad a project is and how big the building is. This is in contrast to the complaints of the art critics and some of the social scientists, who argued that low-rise developments were inherently superior because they were better integrated into the existing community. The counterargument here is that Pittsburgh&#39;s low-rises weren&#39;t integrated into the community at allâthey were usually places on isolated hilltops or in ravines, and often had only one way in and out. So I don&#39;t know what to make of this.

The other issue is that all this discussion about modernism and art criticsâit&#39;s not in the film, I just happen to be familiar with it. This is the film&#39;s biggest flaw; there&#39;s a theory on why the project failed but no discussion of the theory behind why it was supposed to work or in-depth examination of the criticisms of that theory once the failure became apparent. Instead we get mostly reminiscences from former residents interspersed with a few comments from a social scientist. There&#39;s certainly no examination of the counterarguments.

The reason I wanted to write this up here is because the film&#39;s central thesis is intriguing in light of our current housing crisis and homelessness problem. I was riding my bike along the Riverfront trails in Pittsburgh last weekend and I noticed that tents lined the path wherever there was room for them. The previous mayor had a lax attitude toward homeless enforcement but this was different; the tents were well-kept and the people living in them didn&#39;t really look homeless. There was no evidence of drinking or drug use other than the occasional beer, and one ten&#39;s door was open and the inside was reasonably organized. It should also be mentioned that vagrancy downtown was a problem during the Peduto administration but it&#39;s not nearly as bad now, so there&#39;s obviously some additional enforcement going on. I found out later that the people living in these tents have housing vouchers from the county nut there&#39;s nowhere to put them, so they were given tents and permission to set them up until they find apartments. For most of my life, I had been inclined to agree with most of the experts, that public housing was a bad idea for all the usual reasons. But if the result of relying on Section 8 and affordable set asides in market-rate developments just leads to a housing shortage, is it really worse than the alternative? Large projects may be bad, but it&#39;s probably better than sleeping on the street. Furthermore, are they inherently bad, or only bad because of mismanagement and failure to deal with vacancies? These are tough questions, but unfortunately, *The PruittâIgoe Myth* doesn&#39;t answer them.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikelhsn/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ike8dlh/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Is there any serious argument against a free market in human organs if you&#39;re a </title><updated>2022-08-15T15:43:23Z</updated><author><name>MelodicBerries</name></author><content type="text">Is there any serious argument against a free market in human organs if you&#39;re a libertarian?
