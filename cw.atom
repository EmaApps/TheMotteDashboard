Did it? What does this actually mean? It is a sentiment I encounter often. Including on this subreddit in the course of a discussion a few days/weeks ago (most articulately elucidated by /u/FCfromSSC). 

It usually comes up in arguments between Christian and non-Christian right-wingers. e.g:

&#34;Christianity is a cringe cuck Asiatic soy religion&#34; 

&#34;Actually Christianity is heckin based and redpilled and built western civilization.&#34; 

I disagree with the proposition, or at least, I am pretty sure I do. 

I think &#34;Christianity built western civilization&#34; can be interpreted a number of ways. 

First, and least charitably, it could be taken to mean that Christianity has had a very great influence on western civilization over the course of the past, say, fifteen centuries. This is undeniable. There would be no Gothic cathedrals, no *Divine Comedy* without Christianity. Sure. But I don&#39;t think this is what is meant by &#34;Christianity built western civilization.&#34; Because this is a very tautological and uninteresting interpretation of the proposition. If not for Christianity, European civilization would not bear a Christian stamp. Sure. So what?

There is a stronger interpretation, which is that Christianity added something (or some*things*) to European civilization which, while not explicitly Christian, it would not have had without Christianity. For example, it sometimes said that the scientific method is rooted in a Christian worldview (I happen to think this is absurd). However, I could still probably agree with this. European civilization would certainly have been very different without Christianity. Fun as counterfactuals are, we will never know precisely *how* it would have been different, but it certainly would have been, and many of these differences would probably have been subtle and not immediately tied to the absence of Christianity. 

The strongest interpretation of the proposition, and the one I believe its defenders are adhering to, is something like, &#34;European civilization is/was *great* and its *greatness* is entirely or largely owed to Christianity.&#34; This is the interpretation I strongly *disagree* with. 

It depends on what you think is (or was) *great* about European civilization. If you are a Christian, and you say, &#34;Christianity is true, and therefore a civilization that exemplifies Christian morals and virtue is great,&#34; then we have a very deep disagreement, because I *don&#39;t* think Christianity is true. The argument will have to be suspended while we dig down to a deeper level and argue about the truth of Christianity. 

But most defenders of the proposition don&#39;t tend to argue so bluntly. In my experience, they attempt to find common ground with the non-Christian RWer by which they can persuade them that the greatness of European civilization, agreed upon by both parties, can be credited to Christianity. 

So what made European civilization great? In my view it is obvious. 

First and foremost, strength and power. Various nations of Europe subjected a greater portion of the world than any before them. All of the Americas, all of Africa (save a few stubborn states), great swathes of Asia. It was a feat unequalled in world history, and &#34;great&#34; by any reasonable measure. 

Secondly, artistic and cultural achievement. It is obvious that Europe has been the world center for great art for the past several centuries. I confess I am no connoisseur, but *The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa* has left me in awe since high school. To say nothing of architecture, literature, etc. 

Thirdly, scientific achievement. Again, it is quite indisputable that Europe has been the center of scientific and technological excellence for the past several centuries. Northwestern Europe, in particular. No industrial revolution without England. 

So the question is, to what extent was Christianity responsible for any of these three?

I believe the answer is &#34;barely,&#34; or &#34;not at all,&#34; since Europe was leading in all three even before Christianization. If anything there was something of a backslide on all three metrics in the early middle ages. I&#39;m not trying to resurrect &#34;hole left by the Christian dark ages,&#34; but if Christianity had a stimulating effect on European greatness you would not expect its proliferation to coincide with the political, cultural, economic, and artistic decay that characterized late antiquity and the early medieval period. 

This argument is usually capped off with something along the lines of, &#34;well, you&#39;re just a LARPer, western civilization has been Christian for centuries so trying to resurrect pagan Greece or Rome is just dumb and pointless.&#34; Which may be true, but is also a huge self-own considering how many online Christian RWers are trad monarchist LARPer types. One might as easily say, &#34;well, the west has been liberal democratic for two centuries, now. Trying to resurrect catholic monarchy is just dumb and pointless.&#34; Or bring it even further down to date. &#34;Trying to resurrect the 1950s is dumb and pointless, that was more than half a century ago. Move on, stop LARPing.&#34; You get the point. 

I am aware that today, the great majority of western conservatives are Christian or at least Christian adjacent. In real life, I don&#39;t call Christian conservatives cringe and tell them they should be worshipping the Olympians. That would, indeed, be silly and pointless. I am happy to make common cause with Christian RWers IRL. But this is an argument I get into regularly in niche internet spaces, and I happen to think I have the better part of it. I am curious what the users of this subreddit think, since this is after all one of the niche internet spaces in which I have had this and related arguments. 

SIDENOTE: the also-common argument that &#34;Christianity united Europe&#34; is not addressed above because it is almost too stupid for words. After the dissolution of pagan Rome, Europe was never so united again until the 20th century. Christian Europeans spent centuries warring with their fellow Christian Europeans. And of course during the Based Crusades™ another set of Based Crusaders was up north slaughtering Baltic pagans. Not that any of this matters because pan-European nationalism is dumb in most contexts anyways.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imalmyd/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im9xi04/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">How many people here can hold an emotion for 10 minutes?

Sam Harris had a quote recently where he said &#39; 10 minutes of anger can really fuck up your life &#39; and I understood it to be obviously true. But how many people can actually hold an emotion that long? I&#39;ve held sadness twice for a longer period of time: once when a long term gf and I broke up, and once when my best friend killed themselves. I also get angry in spurts - browsing Reddit sometimes does it or hearing peoples various political opinions I disagree with or know that are incorrect - but it&#39;s just a spur of the moment issue. Another example is sports. I love sports but I really never get too up or too down about my teams performance; there&#39;s always next year + being a Marlins and Dolphins fan that would just be an outlet to constant anger. Otherwise, pretty much every other emotion is just done after what seems like several seconds. 

This leads me to question if otherwise I am emotionally comatose the majority of my life? 

Now Sam was talking about it in relation (I believe) of criminality and, as always, of free will and I&#39;m talking about it more on a personal level, and that&#39;s what I&#39;d like to hear feedback on: how long do you hold onto emotions? And how does this impact your life daily and in general?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im9xi04/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im9smmz/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">~~[Voters are split in support of Biden&#39;s $500 billion student loan handout, Bid</title><updated>2022-08-29T16:12:12Z</updated><author><name>greyenlightenment</name></author><content type="text">~~[Voters are split in support of Biden&#39;s $500 billion student loan handout, Biden approval up in new poll](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voters-split-support-bidens-500b-student-loan-handout-biden-approval-poll)~~

&amp;gt;Registered voters are nearly tied in support of President Joe Biden&#39;s recent $500 billion student loan handout initiative, as the economy remains the most important issue to registered voters, according to new poll.

&amp;gt;A new Emerson College Polling national survey suggests that Americans are almost evenly split in favor and opposition to President Joe Biden&#39;s recent student loan handout, with 36% believing the loan handout is too much and 35% thinking it is just the right amount of action. Thirty percent think it is not enough action.

&amp;gt;The majority of registered voters, 51%, believe the executive action will result in colleges raising tuition, whereas 49% think that it will allow students to have more access to education.

538 shows Biden at 42% approval, a little higher than a week ago

https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/

This is the sort of partisan split we would expect for something as polarizing or politicized as his student forgiveness plan. There does not seem to be any evidence yet that Biden is seeing a net-loss of support. 

It&#39;s still possible that SCOTUS will try to block it. RBG not retiring was the ultimate gift for the right that keeps giving, whether it&#39;s Roe v. Wade or this....it shows how important the courts are.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im9smmz/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im9lflo/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">Lost in the shuffle last week was an interview between [Trump’s AG Bill Barr]( h</title><updated>2022-08-29T15:23:57Z</updated><author><name>ChrisPrattAlphaRaptr</name></author><content type="text">Lost in the shuffle last week was an interview between [Trump’s AG Bill Barr]( https://www.commonsense.news/p/bill-barr-calls-bullsht) and Bari Weiss. I don’t normally enjoy writing about this kind of piece because of how heated people can get, but I found this interesting enough that I’ll give it a go.

Tl;dr: Likes:  
-	Trump, the president 
-	The right’s interpretation of Russiagate  
-	Republicans  
-	Joe Manchin and Stephen Breyer  
Dislikes:  
-	Trump, the person  
-	Progressives (unclear to me how wide a net this casts)  
-	Political tribalism  

Barr tells a few stories that echo what has come out about the Trump administration in a number of books and other sources. Stories like this one:

&amp;gt;AG BARR: It was on June 1 when the president was bellowing at a number of his cabinet secretaries, especially the military guys—the secretary and chairman of the joint chiefs. He was calling all of us “fucking losers” at the top of his lungs. 
Or this one, where he tried to resign over the allegations Trump was making of election fraud:
&amp;gt;AG BARR: He was in a little dining room that adjoins the Oval Office. He was as furious as I’d ever seen him. He confronted me and said, “Did you say this to the AP?” And I said, “I did. Because it was the truth.” I went over some of the allegations. He said there was plenty of evidence of fraud. I explained in some detail why the allegations didn’t fly. I told him that there were only five or six weeks to challenge a presidential election because the Constitution requires the Electoral College to meet at a certain date and he didn’t have much time. He’d already wasted five of your six weeks with this crazy stuff about the Dominion machines. He’d wheeled out this clown show of lawyers that no reputable lawyer is willing to work with.  
&amp;gt;I said, “Look, I know you’re unhappy with me. I’m going to tender my resignation.” And he slammed the table. Everyone jumped. And he said, “Accepted.” So I said OK and left. I was getting into my car right outside the White House and all of a sudden, people started pounding on the windows. It was late at night and raining, so it was sort of this eerie thing. The president sent Cipollone, another White House lawyer, out there, to retrieve me and tell me “Nevermind, he’s not going to fire you, and would you come back in?” And I said, “I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any use to going back in tonight. I’m going to go home. But we can talk about it in the morning.” 

I suppose it depends how much credence you lend to his version of events over Trump’s. Barr genuinely seems to like what Trump did while in office, though, if that moves your needle towards believing him. I won’t link those quotes due to space concerns. He also doesn’t lend any credence to the election fraud theories:

&amp;gt;AG BARR: I was somewhat demoralized that he was leaving office this way. The left says, “Oh, you said all these nice things about him in your resignation.” But I felt that what he should do was focus on all his achievements and leave with dignity. Whether he thought there was fraud or not, he had his day in court and he lost.  
&amp;gt;So I was demoralized that he was going out the way he was. I thought it was very unfair to all the people, especially the younger people, who had worked in the administration. It hurt them getting jobs and it also hurt the Republican Party, which I thought up until then, could take the high ground as the party of law and order.  
&amp;gt;I would say it [the January 6th riot] was an effort to intimidate Congress and the vice president. I haven’t heard words from the president that I would consider incitement under the law. That’s a very high bar because of our First Amendment, and it should be a high bar. But I did feel that he was morally responsible for it because he led these people to believe that something could happen on Capitol Hill that would reverse the election. That there’s something they could do involving pressuring the vice president and Congress that would overturn the election. 

Barr also says a number of things about politics that make me think that compromise and a rapprochement are possible. Perhaps I’m projecting, but he seems to argue against reactionary politics and towards something more constructive:

&amp;gt;Something I’m pretty tired of from the right is the constant pandering to outrage. The picking and picking at the scab without trying to channel those feelings in a constructive direction. In my opinion, Ronald Reagan was a great populist not because he followed the frustrated instincts and the outrage of the people, but because he channeled it and was constructive with it…We have these institutions that need reform. The first step is to win an election with a decisive majority that allows you to put a program into effect and fix some of these problems going forward. That is not done by just throwing fuel on the fire of outrage on one side of the equation while the other side does the same thing on their side…I think we should basically try to persuade people. People like Youngkin, the Governor of Virginia, have shown that the Republican Party is a potential majority party.  
&amp;gt;The problem with Trump is that it’s all about running a base election. Whip up your base, get them all upset and outraged, and turn them out at the polls. Both sides do that. That is a prescription for continued hostility and demoralization of the country. The first side to break out of that will do so by restoring politics to what it should be, which is the politics of trying to capture a majority of the people through persuasion and with a decisive enough majority to change things…I say to the people that want to make America great again, “What will it take to do that?” You don’t do it just by making your base madder and madder.  

And yet, at the same time, the way he talks about liberals is depressing:

&amp;gt;although we’ve been sort of harping on the warts of Trumpism, I think the greatest threat to the country is the radical progressive movement and what it’s degenerated into. In 2016, had there been another Democratic administration, I was concerned that we’d have dug an even deeper hole that would be much harder to get out of. I think Trump did serve a historic purpose: He was sort of the wrecking ball and against progressive excess. People were mad about it, and they wanted a no-nonsense person who would be a wrecking ball, and he did that. What I’m saying now is that we need something different moving forward. I give him credit for identifying people’s frustrations and being willing to call out some of the progressive excess that other people were cowering about then.  

&amp;gt;If we’ve left it behind, I don&#39;t think this ends well for the country. I don&#39;t see that this leads to any future for the country. I think we have to return to that if we’re going to have a future. I put this on the doorstep of the radical progressives as their responsibility. They’re the ones who have sharply shifted. The political model before this was the liberal democratic spectrum where you have right and left, but we’re all within the liberal, democratic, Anglo-American political tradition.  

&amp;gt;What we’ve moved to is a bipolar system that’s more typical of revolutionary countries, where you have a party like the Marxists or some other totalitarian party trying to take power. It’s all or nothing and anything goes. It’s war by other means. That’s where we are, and it doesn’t end well.  

&amp;gt;Those of us who are traditional conservatives, Reagan conservatives––I grew up on Bill Buckley and so forth––believe in the Anglo-American system of politics. We have a First Amendment that allows citizens to debate and come to some consensus for the public good. One of the things that bothers me is that people talk about democracy and the threat to democracy. Well, what did the framers think was the threat to democracy? In Federalist 10, Madison says it’s when the majority uses democracy to oppress the minority. When someone takes a transient 51% majority and tries to ram things down the throat of the other 49%, and now we’re finding ourselves sort of oscillating between those two worlds. Get 51 votes, good: Obamacare. You have 51 votes and you shove it down people’s throats. Whereas the institutions that we’ve had before this were meant to require some form of consensus and incremental change. They allowed people to build up some consensus for an approach, and things moved slowly. That’s not good enough for revolutionaries, who want to tear things down or change things instantaneously. I think that’s the basic challenge we face right now.

The party seems to be at a tipping point on the &#34;Trump good/bad&#34; issue, and a small number of votes could have an outsized impact, as far as I can see.

It&#39;s been mostly ran off mainstream sites and most classic blogs are since defunct or moved on to other grift. Still there has been an idea I have been developing for a while.

It was always easy to dismiss as toxic masculinity, motivated by misogyny and sexism. This may be to some extent true but I propose a different framing that unites all the disparate factions even though I don&#39;t think they realize so themselves. It&#39;s about the male gender role. It&#39;s no secret that the traditional male gender role is not what it used to be. Between the state and women in the workforce the provider is largely obsolete and the feminism friendly attempts to construct a new one are just unappealing and don&#39;t really address mens desires at all. How the factions differ is their reaction to that.

Redpill sometimes gets accused of being patriarchal and while some are certainly sympathetic to it (though I think part of that faction has split off into the newer tradlarpers) they instead decide feel that women don&#39;t live up to their standards and *enjoy the decline* becoming philanderers instead. The archetype of philanderer did exist but it was never considered something commendable or worth emulating under traditional conventions. The MGTOW are pretty similar, but they decide to quit altogether. MRA try to renegotiate their place using more conventional activist tactics to get the legal recognition framing it in the terms of *rights* in parallel to women. I think what both are really getting at is that women don&#39;t want to hold up their end of the bargain, but still expect men to do theirs and that&#39;s fundamentally unfair. Traditional gender roles might have given men some power that could be abused but it also came with responsibilities that remain unrecognized, even as women got *liberated* from theirs. 

I think this is a discussion we should have, but unfortunately men constructing a new narrative is hostile to modern feminism. When you&#39;re accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression, as they say.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im8j6bl/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im8a4cm/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">NYT had recently put out a [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/opinion/su</title><updated>2022-08-29T07:29:50Z</updated><author><name>ZeStridingTeufel</name></author><content type="text">NYT had recently put out a [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/opinion/sunday/maternal-instinct-myth.html?smid=tw-share) claiming that maternal instinct was a myth created by men, presumably to domesticate women and reinforce the patriarchy. The author claims that what a mother should be is actually &#34;socialised&#34; behaviour sold through various disciplines from theology to science, with its earliest archetypes extending to biblical accounts of Mary and Eve, and later fortified by Darwin and other evolutionary theorists as the intellectual domain drifted away from faith. It stirred quite a blowback, and a [rebuttal](https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/08/28/is-maternal-instinct-a-misogynistic-myth/#comments) from Jerry Coyne.

I think its worth discussing why any archetype of maternity is frowned upon as regressive and demeaning towards women. There seems to be a section in hyper progressive academia that thinks that gender roles need to be reversed to &#34;right historical wrongs&#34;, in society, in film, etc. Maybe its just votebank politics, maybe corporations want to discourage family priorities through mass media. I&#39;m not quite sure how this division of consumer demographics between the sexes will end, especially at a time when birth rates are falling and the American establishment is realising that its global unipolarity has ended with an ascendant China, an uppity India and a vengeful Russia on the horizon.

Ar</title><updated>2022-08-29T06:24:25Z</updated><author><name>Electronic-Ant1533</name></author><content type="text">**Why does the fat acceptance movement remind you of anti-trans ideology?** 

Are the narrative frameworks of the fat acceptance movement and the anti-transgender movement the same? Both movements posit their respective issues as primarily cultural contagions that are exacerbated by the structure of 21st-century information technology. Additionally, both the fat acceptance movement and the anti-transgender movement imply that the obsession with aesthetics at the heart of American ills has, in the modern era, become the sole arbiter of ethical disagreements. The play-by-play comparison of the typical struggle-session accounts of each movements, I think, is even more revealing of their similarities. I have used scare quotes a lot here, to ensure that no one mistakes either of these opinions for my own.

**The narrative framework of fat acceptance advocates**

* The internet is a **dangerous device**.
* More specifically, the internet promotes the idea that women need to adhere to a specific beauty standard. Before the internet, this beauty standard &#34;didn&#39;t exist,&#34; or at least was not as intensely promoted.
* This beauty standard, of a thin waist, big breasts, etc. is unrealistic and unattainable. **Diets &#34;don&#39;t work&#34; -- that is to say, the media distorts how often people are able to successfully change their &#34;inherent&#34; weight. They are also &#34;dangerous&#34; -- they promote eating disorders**.
* People are brainwashed by the media to accept this aesthetic standard and spread it around their social networks.
* This beauty standard creates socially-derived depression in fat people (that is to say, if this beauty standard were not promoted by the media \[and then spread by people consuming the media\], then this depression would not occur). \*If promotion of this beauty standard did not happen, not only would fat people not be depressed, they would be perfectly happy in their bodies.

As a P.S., such an advocate might claim that there is historical revisionism afoot -- in all of human history, skinny beauty standards are &#34;quite rare.&#34; This is because our ancestors &#34;knew&#34; that skinniness was not a natural state to be in.

**The framework of anti-trans activists**

* The internet is a **dangerous device**.
* More specifically, the internet promotes the idea that people are secretly transgender. Before the internet existed, transgenderism &#34;didn&#39;t exist,&#34; or at least, was not as common.
* Pursuit of a cross-gender beauty standard is unrealistic and unattainable. **HRT and SRS &#34;don&#39;t work,&#34; that is to say, they don&#39;t make people happier, and are &#34;dangerous,&#34; sterilizing people in the pursuit of an aesthetic ideal**.
* People are brainwashed by the media on &#34;transgender ideology&#34; and spread it across their social networks.
* This promotion of &#34;transgender ideology&#34; creates socially-derived depression in people who &#34;think that they are trans&#34; (that is to say, if the &#34;trans ideology&#34; were not promoted by the MSM/social media \[and then spread by people consuming the media\], then this depression would not occur).
* If promotion of this beauty standard did not occur, not only would people who &#34;think that they are trans&#34; not be depressed, they would be perfectly happy in their bodies.

As a P.S., such an advocate might claim that there is historical revisionism afoot -- in all of human history, transgender identities are quite rare. This &#34;shows&#34; that in general, our ancestors &#34;knew&#34; that transgenderism was unnatural.

**What to make of this** 

It seems that ultimately this congruence results from very similar opinions on the average American locus of control. Both movements see people as fundamentally unable to self-evaluate in a media vacuum, and  both groups imply that we should automatically view opinions which mysteriously coincide with those of the MSM with suspicion.

## The radfem-trans activist beef, and its potential relation to the framework of the fat acceptance movement

The MSM (and social media) claims that the clashes between trans activists and radical feminists result from different opinions on gender essentialism. However, considering the overlap of the fat acceptance movement with radical feminist movements (as both question the ways in which women&#39;s bodies are policed), perhaps the origin of the skirmishes between trans and radfem is not even gender itself. Rather, the narratives each movement has woven rely on fundamentally different appraisals of history, culture, and self-determination, making rapprochement impossible.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im85d0q/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
