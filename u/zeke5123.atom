Lived experience is the idea that for example a black person’s experience trumps any data a white person collects because living as a black person provides more info compared to any data a white person could analyze. 

But a person “born” a male who appears a male and lives life as a male cannot have any experience as a woman; that is, just like the white person can’t really know what it’s like to be a black person a male cant really know what it is like or means to be a female. 

So how can the male know he is a female if he can’t understand what a female is due to a lack of lived experience?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igdyu8e/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
