The story of my smoking experiences with pork are ones of being off by multiple hours in terms of completion, so I&#39;m working a whole day ahead of time. If I get done early, which has never happened, I&#39;ll wrap the meat in aluminum trays and keep it warm. 

Since most of y&#39;all are on the west coast I assume the proclivity for cooking vast cuts of meat this way isn&#39;t as popular as it is around my neck of the woods. But right now I have a small electric Masterbilt smoker. It was unbelievably affordable in my estimation, it&#39;s relatively easy to clean, but I&#39;ve been electrocuted while it&#39;s sprinkling a couple times and I&#39;ve always wondered if I should be stepping up to a pellet grill at some point. Any comment from someone who&#39;s made the move would be welcome. I only smoke stuff 6-7 times a year, so perhaps it&#39;s a luxury I shouldn&#39;t be considering anyway.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/ws5dhg/friday_fun_thread_for_august_19_2022/ikxlm5f/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
