However, looking at topical solution it’s ethanol, propylene glycol, water and minoxidil at 1mg/ml. 
So I guess it should be pretty safe to consume with straightforward dosing. Is there any catch, like oral and topical minoxidil being in different form etc.?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilq859f/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
