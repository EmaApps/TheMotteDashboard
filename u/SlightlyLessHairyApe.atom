A [while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/ijs526/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_31_2020/g40dx0u/) u/mcjunker opined that in 18 months after election, Biden would be less popular than Trump. 

In retrospect, it&#39;s not clear if this was meant as &#34;at the same point in their presidency&#34; or &#34;at that moment&#34;, although I lean towards the former since approval ratings of those not in office isn&#39;t usually a topic of discussion.
