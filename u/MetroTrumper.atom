Like how many people are there who can design and manufacture a modern turbine engine? How many can design, construct, and operate a modern IC fab? Or manufacture new high-precision machine tools from scratch, or design and manufacture a really great truck engine, or any number of other fields I don&#39;t even know about.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijcnrj9/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
