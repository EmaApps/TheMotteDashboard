I&#39;m don&#39;t work in tech but I&#39;m noticing more and more non-tech positions wanting some experience with cybersecurity. I&#39;m looking for something self-paced but still produces a certificate that will at least get me past the HR gatekeepers.

Edit: To clarify, I&#39;m not looking to become a full cybersecurity practitioner, just something to demonstrate to whatever HR gremlin is gatekeeping the first-level screening that I understand the basics of cybersecurity. I&#39;m running across a decent amount of non-tech / non-coder roles outside the cybersecurity field asking for &#34;demonstrated knowledge of cybersecurity&#34; without any further clarification.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/illtpd0/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
