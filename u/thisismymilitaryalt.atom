I&#39;m job hunting again and a lot of job applications are asking for a salary range. In the military my salary was almost entirely up to the whims of Congress so I never really thought about it that much. I have a pretty precise budget so I know the minimum I can live on, but I&#39;m having trouble figuring out how high to go on top of that. On the one hand, I don&#39;t want to price myself out of a job but on the other hand I don&#39;t want to lowball myself and get taken for a ride.
