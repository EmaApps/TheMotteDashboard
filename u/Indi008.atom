Free to read, and somewhat unrelated to this sub, but hey it fits the fun theme, and I&#39;m somewhat trying to write rational fantasy if there is such a thing. Not sure I quite achieved that.

Anyone else here a &#34;writer&#34; who studied science or engineering with the intent of writing technically accurate fiction only to find it&#39;s much harder than you think? I never know quite enough, and when I do, no one thinks it&#39;s a real thing. I once wrote a story about a mechanic and an actual issue I faced with my car and people thought it wasn&#39;t realistic, but my complete fantasy stories are apparently completely believable.

Edit: got a joke for y&#39;all...

Why did the cat fall off the roof?
