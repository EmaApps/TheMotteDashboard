The reason for that is the government&#39;s requirement that radioactive waste must be stored securely for 1 million years at least. This seems silly to me. 

Yes radioactive waste is no laughing matter but are we really so concerned about hypothetical people in the far future digging up some barrels of (by then) mildly radioactive debris? This is assuming that A Humans still exist and B They lost the ability to produce Geiger counters. Really what pushes this into hypocrisy territory to me is that we actively don&#39;t give a shit about real actual humans right now. We could feed and shelter homeless people with the money that we&#39;re using to pay these historians and linguists. I just don&#39;t get it.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iihhuxc/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
