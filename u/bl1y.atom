The tldr on the Gambler&#39;s Fallacy is this &#34;We&#39;re flipping a coin. It hit heads the last 4 times, so we&#39;re due a tails this next time.&#34; But, the law of independent variables tells us that&#39;s BS. Each flip is independent, and so the odds of hitting tails doesn&#39;t go up each time you hit heads.

But, does the odds of a heads *increase* for each heads previously flipped?

I want to argue yes, and yeah, I&#39;m aware of the Hot Hand Fallacy. But here&#39;s my idea...

After some improbable number of consecutive heads flipping (and this is important) *the same coin*, the odds that the coin isn&#39;t fair increases. Cheating starts to become a better explanation than just chance.

And this becomes apparent at the extreme. Imagine a coin has been flipped 1 million times, heads all 1 million of them. Then we flip a million and oneth time. What are the odds of heads? It&#39;s not 50/50, because the 1 million previous flips are basically proof positive that the coin is rigged.

If that last million-flip example makes sense, I&#39;d wonder where is the number of flips where we start to think there&#39;s a meaningful deviation from the 50/50 prediction.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifjq0i7/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifiszzt/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] So a Nazi walks into a bar.
