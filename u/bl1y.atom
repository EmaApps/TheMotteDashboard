This is a phrase that gets used a lot, but I recently started to wonder how Hispanic Americans think about it?

With Black Americans, the term might not be everyone&#39;s preferred one, with some folks preferring African American, and some others (mostly younger) preferring Person of Color. But, the term Black seems to have a generally positive connotation and plenty of people are happy to use it.

You get slogans like &#34;Black and proud,&#34; &#34;Black is beautiful,&#34; and &#34;Strong Black man.&#34;

Meanwhile, I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve ever heard a Hispanic person refer to themselves as &#34;Brown&#34; or a &#34;Brown American.&#34; I seem to only hear &#34;Brown&#34; used in the phrase &#34;Black and Brown.&#34; It&#39;ll be in things like &#34;Police violence against Black and Brown people&#34; but never &#34;The Brown vote is central to winning the Nevada primary.&#34; That&#39;d be the Hispanic vote.

In fact, I think if you called a Hispanic person &#34;Brown&#34; to their face, you&#39;d better brace yourself for a slap. There&#39;s no positive connotation to it, quite the opposite, and the word would seem to feed into negative stereotypes about Hispanic people (brown being associated with dirt and shit).

No real question here, just musing.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1tvj2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igkfte0/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] What are the odds the center-left and center-right adopt the traditional gay pri</title><updated>2022-07-17T21:46:31Z</updated><author><name>bl1y</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">What are the odds the center-left and center-right adopt the traditional gay pride flag as a way to signal opposition to the far-left positions on gender and sexuality?

It could be flown to mean *Not* The Progress Flag, but at the same time, the left would have a really hard time throwing -phobic labels at someone flying the rainbow flag.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igkfte0/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
