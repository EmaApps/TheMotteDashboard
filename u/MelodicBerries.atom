[Orbán: &#34;Hungarians are not a mixed race and do not want to become one&#34;](https://dailynewshungary.com/orban-hungarians-are-not-a-mixed-race-and-does-not-want-to-become-one/)

&amp;gt; He slammed Western European countries and politicians for encouraging illegal migration and mixing their population. He said that Western-European cities were lost to the non-European population. Orbán argued that the West moved to Central Europe, suggesting that this region would be Europe’s future.

&amp;gt; He said it would be the task of “our children” to admit Western-European Christians.

&amp;gt; Migration has divided Europe, he said. “The West is split in two”, with one half comprising countries where European and non-European peoples live together. “Those countries are no longer nations,” he said.

&amp;gt;“In a spiritual sense, the West has moved to central Europe,” he said. The two halves of Europe are locked in a battle, he said. The West has rejected central Europe’s desire to allow each nation to live as they like, “and they continue to fight central Europe to change us to be like them,” he said.

The idea that you can be some kind of white nationalist state in the EU strikes me as nary but impossible. The EU accession treaty requires one to sign the dotted line where it lays out in significant detail stuff like human rights, non-discrimination and other various liberal precepts. 

I don&#39;t particularly care if Hungary wants to go off it alone, but it can&#39;t continue to take EU money and then pursue a policy antithetical to its founding principles. 

Idealism aside, it&#39;s those who hold the purse who hold the reins - and it ain&#39;t Hungary and their spiritual brethren in the West.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ihcc72i/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
