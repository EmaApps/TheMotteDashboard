It&#39;s over 50 mins long, so I will jump right into the most controversial CW part. Basically he raises the hypothetical question whether A) the West is degenerate and B) if it is, does that potentially justify or at least *explain* why Putin may have acted in Ukraine to forestall its assimiliation to [GAE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oVkne9WgpY)? 

An outraged left-wing activist has [cut out](https://mobile.twitter.com/thebadstats/status/1546327272780472321) the most relevant part. Peterson first answers the question regarding whether or not the West is degenerate. His answer is clearly yes. 

He then moves to the second part, and speculates that in his view, Putin could indeed have calculated that if did not invade then Ukraine would have become assimilated to GAE and thus lost forever.

Naturally, Peterson is being slammed online as a &#39;Putin shill&#39; and a Russian stooge etc, but the questions he raises are valid. Perhaps we are seeing an element of the culture war actually &#34;going hot&#34;. 

It&#39;s said that the 20th century was a fight between liberalism, fascism and communism. Perhaps wars in the 21st will be fought over transgenderism.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig02yql/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
