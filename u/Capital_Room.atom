Does anyone have any idea how my parents (in their early 60s), and some others their age, came by their belief that the American Revolution was fought — and won — entirely or almost entirely by independent, disorganized individuals armed only with their hunting rifles, slipping through the woods in primitive camouflage, picking off the British who &#34;were sitting ducks, standing in the open in neat lines wearing their bright red coats, like morons,&#34; and said British doing nothing but impotently protesting &#34;that&#39;s just not cricket!&#34; as these lone Patriots violated all the contemporary &#34;rules&#34; of war — &#34;were terrorists,&#34; as my Mom put it?
