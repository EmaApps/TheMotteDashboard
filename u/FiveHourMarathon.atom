For all our optimization/nootropics bros, what&#39;s the best way to adjust my early-bird sleep schedule to go out partying on one night or two and then go right back to my standard sleep schedule?

I&#39;m an early bird, I basically go to sleep by 10:30 at the latest and get up between 4:30 and 5:00 every day. Getting up early is important to me, I like it, I function well that way from years of farm work and crew practice growing up. But as I&#39;m getting into middle age, I find it is getting hard for me to deal with days when I&#39;m at a wedding or a party or a gala or whatever and I want to stay up later and find my body failing me. I&#39;m curious if there&#39;s any scientifically supported evidence for how to handle it beyond pounding a 5 hour energy a couple times in a night.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x3t1mp/friday_fun_thread_for_september_02_2022/imtqbwo/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
