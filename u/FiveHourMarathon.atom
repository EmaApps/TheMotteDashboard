For me personally, compulsive snooping. I can&#39;t not snoop. When I start a job, I tell people, look I&#39;m a snoop, don&#39;t leave files open a file on my computer and expect me not to read it, don&#39;t leave a confidential letter open on the conference table when we&#39;re meeting there, don&#39;t have a &#34;private&#34; conversation in the car with me, I will read/listen/etc. Can&#39;t help myself. My wife and I are the same way, and as a result we&#39;ve always kept phone passwords because we just can&#39;t help ourselves and it&#39;s too much information to share.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igjsk8b/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
