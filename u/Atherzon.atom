For example, I believe that their is a 35% chance that Russia totally controls either Slovyansk or Bakhmut by September 21, 2022, as assessed by the Institute for the Study of War at understandingwar.org.

Anyone else?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih9i22f/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
