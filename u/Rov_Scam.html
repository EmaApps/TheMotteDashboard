It&#39;s a theory I&#39;ve had for a while and it was stoked by the comments below about DeSantis and the 2024 election: Biden isn&#39;t running in 2024. Even if his approval rating recovers I don&#39;t think he has it in him, and that&#39;s the kind of decision that has to be made before he&#39;d know if his approval rating would recover, and he&#39;d be taking a risk that it would tank and hand the election to the Republicans. That being said, he can&#39;t exactly come out and say that he won&#39;t be seeking reelection. He&#39;d immediately become a lame duck and serve the last 2 1/2 years of his presidency in irrelevance. He could be the greatest president in history for that last 2 1/2 years and it wouldn&#39;t matte...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-red-50" title="Culture War"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iitjna5/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-08-03 19:20:09 UTC">Aug 03, 19:20 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Rov_Scam">u/Rov_Scam</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iitjna5/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">**A Few Takeaways from the Kansas Abortion Referendum**
