&amp;gt; ‘‘(6) The sharing with the Secretary of the
10 Treasury of such information as is necessary to determine the tax imposed by section 4192 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to enforcement of this part).

If that&#39;s referring to 26 USC § 4192, uh, [it was repealed in 1965](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-D/chapter-32/subchapter-E).
I don&#39;t think this source is supposed to be a historical snapshot.
So where&#39;s the section?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wchwo3/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_31_2022/iiq99mq/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii63rde/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Yesterday, I switched to a new Internet provider and got decent speed.

Not coincidentally I also reinstalled *League of Legends* for a few rounds with my brother.

It’s popular enough that this kind of gets taken for granted, but the premise is really clever.
On one hand, there’s the distillation of an RPG into each game: do tasks, numbers go up, steer the character to a style you want. There’s a balance between fundamental gameplay loops to improve and broader game *knowledge* to accrue. On the other is the pure PvP aspect using humans as a seed to keep things fresh.

But what really gets me is the specialization. I like a game which gives a specific job, a part of the machine. You get to play to strengths and watch the whole thing come together. And *League* does this better than a lot of games.

Anyone care to share recommendations in this “specialist” genre?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii63rde/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
