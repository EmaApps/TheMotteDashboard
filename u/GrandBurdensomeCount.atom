People here often complain that minorities coming from third world countries don&#39;t assimilate into western culture and keep up their own cultural traditions from back home and do not mix with the natives to any significant degree. When you tell them that white &#34;expats&#34; are just as guilty of the exact same behaviours the standard refrain is that the expats aren&#39;t going to permanently live in their new country and so it&#39;s fine, and besides they are net contributors to the economies of the foreign countries so they should be grateful of such people.

However this fails to account for the large  number of e.g. white retirees from countries like the UK that go off to spend their dotage in a place like Spain with more sun and less rain. These &#34;expats&#34; are going off to permanently live the rest of their lives in their new countries and are a net drain on public finances because of all the healthcare expenditure associated with old age. Also, the pensioner emigres also display the exact same insular behaviour of not learning the languages/creating their own internal communities they spend all their time in that third world immigrants/expats do. And yet, we do not see anywhere near the amount of criticism of this behaviour from westerners that they dispense towards minority immigrants doing the exact same stuff. To me this feels extremely hypocritical and something that should be called out.

EDIT: I&#39;m getting lots of replies in the form of &#34;pensioners don&#39;t have kids which makes it all completely different&#34; and I can&#39;t help but be reminded of a common tactic I see (principally from the left) where they say &#34;X is true&#34; and you counter with &#34;what about situation Y where X is not true&#34; and they then say &#34;but in Y there is factor Z so it doesn&#39;t count&#34; where they never ever brought up factor Z during their initial &#34;X is true&#34; statement. I think that is bad reasoning, and equally I think this too is bad reasoning, you&#39;re looking for minute differences between the situation I presented and that of immigrants to the west and saying that those differences render my argument invalid.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/ifc80g8/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
