The term was referenced in a YouTube video I watched and I looked it up, all I got were definitions like &#34;a guy who lies to women to get sex,&#34; &#34;a serial monogamist who convinces women he loves them but just wants sex&#34;... basically the key points were 1) wanting sex not a relationship and 2) willing to lie to women about their intentions.

Is that it? I dunno, I guess it just seems like that&#39;s a very imprecise definition for a word like that. Do the definitions I found exhaust the meaning of the word or am I missing something?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilab9wd/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
