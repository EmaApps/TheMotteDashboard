I dropped out of a software engineering degree after a couple internships taught me that desk jobs make me want to suck start a shotgun, finished a degree in Business Admin to have something, and now I&#39;m a bit lost. Now I&#39;m 25 and floating around retail. I enjoy the physical labor and enforced socialization with customers, but I&#39;m trying to map out a plan for an actual career where I can make money that isn&#39;t just above poverty level and get weekends off.

Broadly, I like physical work and interacting with people, but have a difficult time doing things I find pointless or immoral and can&#39;t tolerate the heat very well. I&#39;d prefer to avoid further education except as a last resort.

Any tips?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/weyt58/wellness_wednesday_for_august_03_2022/ij92y58/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
