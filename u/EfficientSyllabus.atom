Here&#39;s the [complete official translation](https://miniszterelnok.hu/speech-by-prime-minister-viktor-orban-at-the-31st-balvanyos-summer-free-university-and-student-camp/), and [subtitled video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyNVFIo23Bg).

Summaries by [Hungarian portal 444](https://insighthungary.444.hu/2022/07/28/orban-causes-outrage-for-opposing-mixed-race-society-in-hungary), [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/viktor-orban-against-race-mixing-europe-hungary), [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/27/europe/viktor-orban-hungary-race-speech-intl/index.html).

&amp;gt; Migration has split Europe in two – or I could say that it has split the West in two. One half is a world where European and non-European peoples live together. These countries are no longer nations: they are nothing more than a conglomeration of peoples. I could also say that it is no longer the Western world, but the post-Western world. And around 2050, the laws of mathematics will lead to the final demographic shift: cities in this part of the continent – or that part – will see the proportion of residents of non-European origin rising to over 50 per cent of the total.

&amp;gt; In such a multi-ethnic context, there is an ideological feint here that is worth talking about and focusing on. The internationalist left employs a feint, an ideological ruse: the claim – their claim – that Europe by its very nature is populated by peoples of mixed race. This is a historical and semantic sleight of hand, because it conflates two different things. There is a world in which European peoples are mixed together with those arriving from outside Europe. Now that is a mixed-race world. And there is our world, where people from within Europe mix with one another, move around, work, and relocate. So, for example, in the Carpathian Basin we are not mixed-race: we are simply a mixture of peoples living in our own European homeland. And, given a favourable alignment of stars and a following wind, these peoples merge together in a kind of Hungaro-Pannonian sauce, creating their own new European culture. This is why we have always fought: we are willing to mix with one another, but we do not want to become peoples of mixed-race. [...] The time will come when we have to somehow accept Christians coming to us from there and integrate them into our lives. This has happened before; and those whom we do not want to let in will have to be stopped at our western borders – Schengen or no Schengen.

One long-term (20+ years) advisor of his, the sociologist Zsuzsa Hegedüs (who is Jewish herself) has stepped down after the speech and called it &#34;pure Nazi text worthy of Goebbels&#34;, due to such explicit references to &#34;race&#34; (&#34;faj&#34; in Hungarian).

Shortly after the speech people realized that it is almost verbatim from a 1973 book. In fact Orbán mentions the book just a bit before the above section:

&amp;gt; There is an outstanding 1973 book on this issue which was written in French, and recently published in Hungary. It is called “[The Camp of the Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Camp_of_the_Saints)” [Le Camp des Saints], and I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the spiritual developments underlying the West’s inability to defend itself.

The NYT wrote [an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/books/stephen-miller-camp-saints.html) on it in 2019: &#34;A Racist Book’s Malign and Lingering Influence - “The Camp of the Saints,” published in 1973, has been a must-read within white supremacist circles for decades. Stephen Miller, Marine Le Pen and Steve King have touted it in recent years.&#34;

Most of the above quoted speech section is from the intro of the book, including exact phrases like &#34;historical and semantic sleight of hand&#34;. Orbán(&#39;s speech writers) basically just swapped the &#34;Gallo-Roman sauce&#34; of the original French book with &#34;Hungaro-Pannonian sauce&#34;.

Common directions of criticism were 1) that Hungarians are also mixed, no population is racially pure, 2) Hungarians came from Asia, 3) it&#39;s biologically inaccurate to talk about &#34;faj&#34; (=&#34;race&#34;, &#34;species&#34;) regarding humans.

Interestingly, or not, back in 2012, Orbán also called Hungarians &#34;half-Asian&#34; ([HU source](https://24.hu/belfold/2012/07/26/orban-veszekedos-felazsiai-nep-a-magyar/)):

&amp;gt; &#34;My philosophy is that unity is a question of strength: if there is strength, there is unity,&#34; he said. There are other ways of forging unity - for example, in the Scandinavian countries - but he believes that the Hungarians are incapable of doing so. &#34;That&#39;s the only way it works with half-Asian derivatives like us. Here everyone is clever, everyone knows better, everyone has a better idea,&#34; he said.

[Turanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turanism) and emphasizing cultural or other relations to Turkic peoples have been common over the last ~150 years on the conservative right wing in Hungary. So how does this add up? Not so well, because the text was essentially taken out of a French nationalist context, and it doesn&#39;t fit so well. The actual far-righters in Hungary, like the Our Homeland Movement have been talking about a &#34;Northern Civilization&#34; (&#34;from the Celts all the way to the Japanese&#34;) instead of Western for some time now, exactly for this reason, and I guess as a way to get closer to the Russian far-right vision of Dugin&#39;s Eurasianism.

So saying that Hungarians came from Asia misses the point (well, it&#39;s arguable anyway in a modern genetic sense, and even if so, the origin was near the Urals, the border of Europe). Orbán and the far right&#39;s problem is with Africans and Middle Eastern Muslims.

He has since stated that his speech may have been misunderstandable, and he actually just meant cultural differences, not biological. But the word &#34;race&#34; was unusually blunt even for Orbán. He usually talks in terms of religion (Christianity vs Islam) or cultures and civilizations, not races. In fact, the Hungarian word he used (&#34;faj&#34;) is now quite taboo in this sense, today it&#39;s only used in the meaning of &#34;species&#34; (of animals or plants). Another common criticism came from this angle: that humanity is one species, *Homo sapiens*. This is a very shallow criticism but apparently many felt that it&#39;s some kind of gotcha, that Orbán doesn&#39;t even know basic biology and doesn&#39;t understand the concept of &#34;species&#34;. Except that &#34;faj&#34; used to be a much broader term, for stuff like ethnicity, nationality, race, species etc.

Zooming out a bit, it&#39;s clear that Orbán loves the kind of attention that these speeches give him. It&#39;s like antifragility, he thrives on being demonized and gets stronger each time when he survives these. So, since there was a possibility of difficulties at home (due to economic problems, they can&#39;t keep to their election promises just a few months after their re-election), he decided to cause some controversy so he can again frame things in this way, that all conflict with the EU ultimately stems from the issues of migration, gender, Soros etc. That&#39;s his home turf, that&#39;s the lens he wants on everything.

On Thursday, Orbán [will speak at CPAC Texas in Dallas](https://www.newsweek.com/von-der-leyen-rips-orban-over-mixed-race-speech-cpac-still-welcoming-him-1729399), to the outrage of American media.

So, 1) Most of this wasn&#39;t even Orbán&#39;s own ideas but took it verbatim from a book, 2) The reaction to it was lazy criticism, the nth iteration of calling Orbán a fascist or feigning ignorance about meanings of words or performatively not understanding that by other races Orbán meant Africans and Middle Easterners, not Uralic Asians. 3) Orbán needed nothing other than exactly that, to be criticized for his stance on migration and gender instead of utility price hikes and tax raises.

So is he a racist? It doesn&#39;t matter because this is post-politics. People perform to get reactions, it&#39;s not about beliefs. A prominent journalist from Orbán&#39;s circles, Zsolt Bayer (shown [here](https://nepszava.hu/3162052_nemeth-szilard-bayer-zsolt-alsoors-rasszizmus-polo-fenykep) with a Secretary of State) wore a &#34;white lives matter&#34; T-shirt just a few weeks ago. It&#39;s hard to tell what one should interpret as sincere opinions (if that&#39;s even possible for a politician to have) versus pure posturing. But it&#39;s mostly just two sides symbiotically needing each other to justify themselves.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iilcoqr/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
