&amp;gt;When President Biden spoke on Sept. 1st, to tell the nation that democracy is in danger, his warnings echoed the words of many who have been paying attention. Especially those who study the past. Not a month earlier, the president met with a group of handpicked historians who told him that democracy was teetering, hanging on by a thread.

NPR is running this piece in their history section today. Out of five (!) scholars advising the President, all five are *White*. Not a single person of color. The article links to WaPo, which mentions that’s Biden’s speechwriter Vishy Reddy ...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-red-50" title="Culture War"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imzlrm8/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-09-03 23:22:23 UTC">Sep 03, 23:22 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/Difficult_Ad_3879">u/Difficult_Ad_3879</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imzlrm8/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">Update to the Kiwifarms Saga: [Cloudflare has blocked Kiwifarms from using their</a><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imzlrm8/?sort=confidence" class="text-gray-500"> service](https://blog.cloudflare.com/kiwifarms-blocked/)

The Cloudflare argument (which may be an excuse to cover for political pressure behind the scenes) is that because some user made a threat on Kiwifarms, the website ought to be refused service. This is despite Kiwifarms having strict rules regarding threats and always issuing bans soon after violating posts are published.
