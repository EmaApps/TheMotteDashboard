What&#39;s interesting is that the gas seems to have completely run out of covid as a scary monster.  The press team is trying to treat this as if it&#39;s a major story that they need to provide updates on - Karine gave a long explanation of his current condition, and earlier today Biden gave a [incredibly bizarre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhR0w2eFFSI) talk about gas prices that seems intended to sortof play up how sick he is.  Why in gods name does this look like he&#39;s reporting from a cave in Afghanistan?  They literally built him an entire game show set to do these sorts of things from in the white house.  My guess is that they&#39;re trying to build some sort of story of him overcoming a challenge.

But: 

* [cnn isn&#39;t even apparently carrying the story](http://cnn.com).  Instead they&#39;re talking about Bannon being found guilty of not participating in the show trial about January 6th.

* [MSNBC is the same](https://www.msnbc.com/).  Nothing about Biden and covid, main story is about Bannon.

* [Nytimes is the same](https://www.nytimes.com/)

I&#39;m sure I could keep going.

Is this the final nail in the covid coffin?  Are we really actually done with this stuff?  The president of the US, a decrepit, 80 year old man who appears to be in incredibly poor health, gets it and nobody seems to even care.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih8eh3z/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih704dz/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] The January 6th hearings are still occurring, and I want to talk about them.

This was the &#34;bombshell&#34; video from yesterday where, apparently during some outtakes, Trump refused to say that the election was over: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kih5hGkx5-M

Except...this sounds a lot more like he is just critiquing the phrasing of a speech than anything else. 

I&#39;m reminded of this classic Simpsons clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqDP8SnPVA0

The other &#34;bombshell&#34; is Josh Hawley &#34;fleeing&#34;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rDGnMHNs_Y

Except, again: no he isn&#39;t?  This looks like he&#39;s taking a few quick steps probably to catch up with somebody on the escalator, and then walking next to them to chat.

I guess what I&#39;m frustrated by is just *how blatant* they are now being about this.  There isn&#39;t even the veil of an attempt to honestly present anything that has happened here.

What I&#39;m concerned about here is: what happens when the republicans take back control of the government?  What happens if *Trump* wins the presidency in 2024?  They&#39;ve spent the last 6 year pumping out various conspiracy theories about Russian collusion, and now &#34;insurrection&#34;.  It feels like laying the groundwork for something.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih704dz/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
