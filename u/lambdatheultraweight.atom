I have experience with Modadinil and it was alright, but not life-changing.

I saw Nootropics Depot has a new product: OptiNAD+ to increase NAD+ levels.
Assuming ND is a good store, is there something to NAD+?
I&#39;m also interested in Maca extract for energy purposes.

If anyone has experienced to share specifically about those two or success stories in general I&#39;m very interested. How to safely source these things in Europe would also be good to know.
