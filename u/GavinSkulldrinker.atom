I switched to 10mg XRs about a year ago, and after taking an accidental break from them for a weekend, found my depression lifting a surprising amount.  Time passes much faster, I find it easier to sleep.  I find it easier to think creatively.  My performance at work is suffering, but coffee+nicotine+weak weed seems to be getting me through this week compared to last week.  I feel less helpless anxiety when faced with tasks.  I feel better able to keep myself company.

I still hate my life, but the experience of living it is less irritating to me now.  

I&#39;m going to see a different, less-intrusive doctor and get switched back to regular release, maybe up the daily dosage to 20, but see if I can get by only taking 10 or 15.  I just know the XRs aren&#39;t for me.

Has anyone else had similar experiences with XRs vs regulars?  Did you find an alternative to Adderall?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih7pji9/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
