&#34;Asshole Genie&#34; or &#34;Monkey&#39;s Paw&#34; is where the wish-granting entity always tries to find a way to technically fulfill the request but leave the wisher worse-off somehow.  Like wishing for a million dollars just teleports a million dollars from the nearest bank vault.  A really, really asshole genie would also teleport all the radio trackers and ink packs. 

Reverse Monkey&#39;s Paw is where the requester&#39;s requests are so poorly-thought-out they really can&#39;t be fulfilled.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/imow4dm/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
