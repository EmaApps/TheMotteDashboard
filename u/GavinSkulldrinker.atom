Since I now view Star Wars as a dead franchise, the only thing left fun to do with it is armchair-write-produce-direct it.

Write a better version of The Last Jedi.  (Which means Force Awakened happened.  Deal with it)

Hardmode: Keep as much of the original film&#39;s elements as possible.

Funmode: You get to Ignore The Force Awakens.  Do whatever you want with a new Star Wars trilogy</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w524ad/friday_fun_thread_for_july_22_2022/ihkt65w/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih7pji9/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[WW] I&#39;m taking a break from my ADHD meds.

I switched to 10mg XRs about a year ago, and after taking an accidental break from them for a weekend, found my depression lifting a surprising amount.  Time passes much faster, I find it easier to sleep.  I find it easier to think creatively.  My performance at work is suffering, but coffee+nicotine+weak weed seems to be getting me through this week compared to last week.  I feel less helpless anxiety when faced with tasks.  I feel better able to keep myself company.

I still hate my life, but the experience of living it is less irritating to me now.  

I&#39;m going to see a different, less-intrusive doctor and get switched back to regular release, maybe up the daily dosage to 20, but see if I can get by only taking 10 or 15.  I just know the XRs aren&#39;t for me.

Has anyone else had similar experiences with XRs vs regulars?  Did you find an alternative to Adderall?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih7pji9/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
