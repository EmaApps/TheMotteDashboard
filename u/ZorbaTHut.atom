Epistemic status: almost certainly wrong, but perhaps with some kernel of meaning somewhere.

I&#39;m watching an anime called Silver Spoon, which I have a lot of things to say about but this isn&#39;t really one of them. It takes place mostly at an agricultural college and, unsurprisingly, the rest of it is mostly farms. It&#39;s full of scenes like [this one](https://i.imgur.com/tGqcD7y.png).

For some reason, my thought here was that this is simultaneously very empty and very full. It&#39;s full of *things*, but not *people*. This is, from what I understand, just what farms look like; they are very equipment-heavy, and so you&#39;ll have massive enormous farms, filled with giant silos and buildings and massive machines, but with surprisingly few *people* working at any given moment.

I can&#39;t help but compare this to my mental image of, say, the 1800s. In the 1800s, you had a small room with a bed and a table, you had a set of clothes, you maybe had a few other knickknacks. But most people fundamentally didn&#39;t have much *stuff*. Even when you went to work, *per capita*, you didn&#39;t really have much *stuff*; there are plenty of photos like [this one](https://www.cmog.org/sites/default/files/images/bib_92651.jpg). Just in terms of kilograms-of-mass-of-tooling-per-person, these aren&#39;t even vaguely in the same ballpark.

In some ways, this feels like an example of what wealth *is*. Back then, iron and steel and concrete were expensive and so people didn&#39;t have much of them. Today they are, relatively speaking, cheap, and yes there&#39;s obviously rich and poor, but even *poor people* today have ownership and access to far more iron, steel, and concrete than they did in the 1800s.

A month back, an artist [posted a bunch of posters they&#39;d made inspired by brutalist imagery](https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/vbz5fe/tribute_to_italian_futurist_antonio_santelia_i/). I think these are absolutely gorgeous in a raw and lonely way. To me, *they get the same feeling across*; yes, there are tiny ant-like people next to huge monoliths of concrete and glass (and iron and steel). But those monoliths are built *for them*, they&#39;re built for what they do for those people and for other people. Look at how much concrete each person has harnessed to their own benefit! Look at how many *tons* of raw material that is! The Hoover Dam powers 1.3 million households and weighs 6.6 million tons; that&#39;s *five tons of material per household*, just for the material used to provide their personal electricity!

Somewhat more directly is [this image](https://i.imgur.com/mwQG4nB.jpg), same artist. The building&#39;s purpose is unknown and the image is ambiguous enough that many other people will see this and get different things out of it. But to me, this is an apartment building; the person lives in a towering edifice of metal and glass, and even if you assume a small part of it is hers, this is still *wealth*, this is the ability to spend resources on that scale, the ability to *have* things and *use* them to your own benefit.

I kinda like this metric because in some ways it is very objective. It does not require that you hire *people*, because the cost of a &#34;person&#34; shifts wildly over time; it does not require that you pin anything to a shifting basket of technology and consumer goods. If concrete becomes cheaper *then that is still wealth*.

Perhaps we should measure a human not by the size of their wallet, nor by the size of their brain or muscles, but by the mass of steel and concrete harnessed for their benefit. And by that metric we have become very wealthy indeed.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ihatskw/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
