I&#39;ve seen a video that makes fun of how outdated Afrikaans social morality is by having these two Afrikaans-speaking flight attendants innocently spit out racist and macho comments at passengers. 

So I think Elon Musk is also stuck as a Boer War era Afrikaan, which is like how the world isolated South Africa because it insisted on using the 19th century idea of apartheid in a 20th century postmodern world.  Elon Musk&#39;s idea of ​​heroic space exploration also reminds me of the doomed British Northeast Passage and Antarctic expeditions.

Of course, he&#39;s not 100% Victorian because although he has 10 children like a Victorian, he mates with multiple females like a modern celebrity.  So I think he has the core of Victorian social morality and worldview, which is expressed through the means of modern celebrity and mass media culture.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ik5jzza/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
