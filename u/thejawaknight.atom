I have a friend who&#39;s suddenly gone very far to the left and she believes that we need a violent revolution against today&#39;s &#34;systems.&#34; She also thinks she needs to constantly keep a &#34;revolutionary mindset&#34; in order to overthrow the government. Has anyone else had experience with friends becoming this radical?

 I still intend to stay friends with her but I just wanted to see what experiences other people might have had with this.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wnz8wv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_14_2022/ikvg8f1/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikvarq7/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] I have a friend who&#39;s suddenly gone very far to the left and she believes that w</title><updated>2022-08-19T00:18:27Z</updated><author><name>thejawaknight</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">I have a friend who&#39;s suddenly gone very far to the left and she believes that we need a violent revolution against today&#39;s &#34;systems.&#34; She also thinks she needs to constantly keep a &#34;revolutionary mindset&#34; in order to overthrow the government.

I was listening to a podcast which interviewed a parent about social emotional learning in their school. She believes that it&#39;s a form of mind control. Does anyone know that much about the subject and its flaws/strengths?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikv9b16/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikoxkaa/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Why is the argument so common that because a system had origins in oppression (r</title><updated>2022-08-17T18:48:19Z</updated><author><name>thejawaknight</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Why is the argument so common that because a system had origins in oppression (racism/misogyny/homophobia) the system is automatically irredeemable and can only be fixed by a revolution outside the system?

It seems like a form of magical thinking to me as if the structures were suffused with some ethereal quality of racism in them. I feel like you would need to demonstrate how those systems operate in an oppressive manner today rather than just constantly pointing to history.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikoxkaa/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikorm5k/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Where does the talking point about men trying to control women&#39;s bodies in relat</title><updated>2022-08-17T18:11:20Z</updated><author><name>thejawaknight</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Where does the talking point about men trying to control women&#39;s bodies in relation to abortion come from? I always saw it as conservatives believing that the fetus has moral value and I&#39;m not sure why people say that they just want to control women.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikorm5k/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
