Remember [that](https://t.me/quokkas_den)? It&#39;s still around, yes. Recently we got semi-recognition and a link in the subreddit&#39;s sidebar.

Refresher:

*Q: What is the point?*

Lower inhibition, lower effort conversations. While civility and order is maintained,  most of TheMotte rules do not apply. Why? Well, we do already have a place where they apply. Motte rules produce good discussions, but also constrain, so I thought there is value in  experimenting with something a little different. Chat format is a good fit for that - it has different architecture and features compared to a forum like this one. 

*Q: Is it private?*

Nope. At least don&#39;t treat it like it is - Telegram asks your phone number. Possible remedy for those of us unfortunate to live in places where this might be a concern - buy a burner phone, you might need it anyway. Or try to suppress the urge to speak blasphemies, I guess?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij137le/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
