The argument was that there are too many immune and genetic problems being introduced into the population, since all births have a higher chance of living into teenage years, whereas historically about half died in childhood. The children that died historically were the most ill. Then you have fewer generally dying from disease. Then there are not enough maximally healthy people producing children, whereas in the past they might produce a dozen.

This was very persuasive to me, but I don’t know any data. It seems reasonable that to maximize genetic health you want (1) the least healthy not producing and (2) the most healthy producing exponentially. We see with all animal. I’ve been seeing it occur outside my window, as a single house wren family has birthed four babies each of the past four seasons. Of their 16 kids, surely not all are expected to continue living, and probably only a few would continue exponential birthing. 

Anyway does anyone have any relevant information to this question?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/iexr7y5/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
