It would seem to fall in line with other kinds of “fasting” that have health benefits (caloric fasting, sleep restriction to increase sleep efficiency). The closest I could find is a study where *not* hydrating *within* an exercise session (but a little after) led to increased cardiovascular gains. My intuition is that there is probably some health benefit to ~8 hours of the day refraining from hydration, followed by over-hydration.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihg15n2/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w524ad/friday_fun_thread_for_july_22_2022/ih7phca/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] What’s the simplest, most barebones game you can think of?
