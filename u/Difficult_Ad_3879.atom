Rather than a kind of compassion that the powerful feel toward the weak, should it be seen as a form of social capital that the powerful use to subjugate the weak?

When you examine how much is needed to create a truly sympathetic account of something today — the domination of a social environment to trap an audience, writers and designers, publications, media, attractive spokesmen, storytellers — it reads like a veritable army. All of these “soldiers” work together to create a sympathetic portrayal of an event in the hopes of influencing opinion. If you can raise an influencer army, are you really weak? And if you are a captured audience to sympathetic messaging, are you really powerful?

We see that enemy powers fight over sympathy. Israel and the Arab world use their influence to fight over dominant sympathy. The truly weak party finds themselves at the disadvantage, lacking the prerequisite capital for strong messaging. 

A documentary is not a documentary[1]. A documentary is never a documentary. It’s more like a special military operation, or espionage behind enemy lines. “The Lobby” encapsulates this idea. State-owned *Al Jazeera* used (expensive) investigative journalists to uncover the lobbying efforts of Israelis in the UK and America, who ostensibly use their power to promote sympathetic portrayals of themselves and unsympathetic portrayals of their enemies. In the first series of the documentary, the Israelis keep a “hit list” of pro-Arab politicians to socially “take down”, using their social capital in the media, and accusations of oppression (anti-semitism) are brought against pro-Palestinians. And the Arabs responded by creating this documentary, a one-sided portrayal of all of the above, which lead to government inquests and the election of a Muslim student leader. In the second series, we learn that a wealthy Israeli businessman runs a website that accuses anti-Israeli activists of oppression (anti-semitism) in an attempt to, well, oppress them (shaming and blackmailing). However, this documentary never officially aired — Israel pressured Qatar to can airings of the documentary; Republican congressmen asked Jeff Sessions to label Al Jazeera a foreign agent, and the Justice Department to investigate Al Jazeera. The *Zionist Organization of America* boasted of lobbying the Qatari government to can the documentary.

This documentary was not small potatoes, as evidenced by the “exaggerated” Israeli response. But their reaction wasn’t exaggerated at all. A documentary is a weapon of sympathy, and Israel and the Arab world are fighting over control of sympathy. I question whether there is any organic sympathy left to be found that is not boosted by powerful sponsors.
