I’m pretty sure our culture is drinking incorrectly. Alcohol has a significant *retrograde* enhancement on memory; it especially enhances positive-valence memory and (perhaps) social/language memory, but only post-learning.  I don’t think the mechanism is conclusive but the hypothesis is that it works by reducing memory interference on information presented post-ingestion. There is no benefit to drinking *before* learning on memory acquisition, there is only a benefit *after* learning on memory *consolidation*. Drinking before any learning will negatively influence acquisition and retention. Or so studies suggest.

This would mean that, if we are to drink, we ought to (1) not pre-game; (2) exposure ourselves to a context where we desire to create preferentially happy memories, (3) drink immediately following the context. If we are drinking to bond socially, we want the bonding to be before the drinking starts. If we are drinking with a book, we may want to start reading before we start drinking. It would also seem that if we have to do some annoying negative thing, alcohol will enable it to be done without much negative effect on mood when it is over.

It’s surprising to read historical accounts of writers and thinkers drinking so much. It’s likely that culture used to be oriented toward this more beneficial style of drinking. Think: drinking in ode of some emotionally-charged celebration (wedding, then after-party); drinking the wine *in memory* of Christ; etc.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w9703v/wellness_wednesday_for_july_27_2022/ihvm026/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
