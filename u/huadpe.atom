Initial reporting only came from an article [sourced to an Indiana doctor who&#39;d had a 10 year old child brought in for an abortion after one was not available in Ohio.](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/health/2022/07/01/indiana-abortion-law-roe-v-wade-overturned-travel/7779936001/)  The story naturally attracted a lot of attention from abortion-rights advocates up to and including [the President.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/08/biden-abortion-10-year-old-rape-victim/)  Given the story&#39;s visceral impact and the general inability of Republican politicians [to defend the policy,](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/03/kristi-noem-abortion-children-00043886) there was a lot of skepticism thrown at the initial reporting.

Most notably, the [attorney general of Ohio](https://www.fox19.com/2022/07/12/not-whisper-evidence-show-10-year-old-ohio-rape-victim-got-abortion-indiana-ag-yost-tells-fox-news/) went on Fox News and claimed the story had no evidence, and the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-abortion-story-too-good-to-confirm-joe-biden-ten-year-old-girl-indiana-ohio-caitlin-bernard-11657648618) called it a &#34;fanciful tale.&#34;

Today we have confirmation that [a man was arrested and charged with a crime fitting that description in Columbus, OH.](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2022/07/13/columbus-man-charged-rape-10-year-old-led-abortion-in-indiana/10046625002/)</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1aso9/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
