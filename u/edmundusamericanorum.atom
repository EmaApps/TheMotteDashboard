There are considerable similarities and they have common ancestry(and there is precedent for treating different diseases under one name, so this is defensible. However, it has led to some cognitive distinctions, namely the duration of the Covid, underestimating vaccine effectiveness, but also underestimate vaccine obsolescence. Covid (original) has long sense died out in the wild. On the other hand if you by some fluke run into it, your vaccination will protect you relatively well. But what is out circulating now, our vaccines mostly control symptoms, it is a bit like using (a safer) smallpox vaccine against monkeypox. Potentially justifiable in a pinch but not something that we should accept long term and something that funding should be set aside to fix. We need newer vaccines and we need them much faster, if the FDA can not keep up, we need to start congressional investigations about how to get rid of it. If the FDA, is worth salvaging, these should speed things up.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/ij73aja/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
