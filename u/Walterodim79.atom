I&#39;ve considered this one of the nicer features of my home, particularly given how many cityscapes don&#39;t have all that nice of views. In the past couple months, a group of indigents have taken up residence in the park and seem to be escalating their degree of permanence; what started with someone sleeping with their head on their suitcase moved to having a couple mattresses, and today I see that a tent has been added. During the day, more of their friends show up and spread out more mattresses and blankets and drink all day. 

What&#39;s the appropriate reaction to this? How would you feel and react to it? I&#39;ve done nothing about it at present other than comment to my wife that I think it&#39;s going nowhere good, but I&#39;m trying to process whether I should be doing anything about it or just dealing with the fact that this is just how American cities are.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wnz8wv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_14_2022/ika0y4x/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
