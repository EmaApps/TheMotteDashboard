And/or what&#39;s a better way I can find same than posting the question here?

Well, the other obvious one is to get a better job, so to clarify why it&#39;s even a problem: I&#39;m basically a NEET right now, have been for like 6 years, failed to complete my undergraduate (physics) degree, never been employed. So, it at least *feels like* I have no marketable skills, and like my executive dysfunction will keep me that way. Also my social anxiety has probably only got worse in this time.

So, what options aren&#39;t I considering, or haven&#39;t I heard of?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/iloo9nm/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
