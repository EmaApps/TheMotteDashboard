He also kept his daily calorie intake up by drinking   shakes, yet he still lost 3/lbs a week even though his calorie intake was presumably the same.  Some for people with esophagus cancer who go to a liquid diet; they lose so much weight despite consuming unlimited liquid calories. I wonder if liquid diets violate the age-old calorie-in-calorie out maxim.  Of course, some of this weight loss is due   to the cancer itself, but I wonder how much the liquid diet plays a role in this too....</a></blockquote></div></div></div><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-sm text-gray-400">Generated on <span title="2022-09-12 02:48:28.449240925 UTC">Sep 12, 02:48 UTC</span></div></div><div class="flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-sm text-gray-500"><p>Powered by <a class="font-semibold" href="https://ema.srid.ca">Ema</a> | <a href="https://github.com/EmaApps/TheMotteDashboard">Source &amp; Feedback</a></p></div></div></div></main></body></html>
