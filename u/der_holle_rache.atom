This predicament makes quite difficult to remain motivated: the only way I&#39;ve found to help reach the above-mentioned objectives is adopting a behavioral and robotic method like the pomodoro timer and shut down any kind of thinking and emotions: &#34;Execute, do not think of the reward!&#34;.

Nevertheless these methods have begun to work less effectively each time I use them since there is no light at the end of the tunnel: &#34;Why should I execute these commands if, at the end, I will feel no satisfaction from it?&#34;, besides, constantly maintaining a robotic attitude toward a major part of life is stressful and easily spirals into an endless cycle of anxiety, desperation, depression and procrastination.

Has anyone here ever felt the same way? Do you have any advice?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v2a9l4/wellness_wednesday_for_june_01_2022/iarqded/"/></entry></feed>
