Added spoiler tags accordingly for those of you who don&#39;t want to see a silly yet &#34;banworthy&#34; meme, and for those of you tired of hearing about the internet. Just ignore it if you aren&#39;t interested. Have a nice day


I got permabanned from &amp;gt;!/r/austin!&amp;lt; for posting this: &amp;gt;!https://i.redd.it/7cgcotj3to091.png!&amp;lt;  

Reason given: &#34;spamming&#34;

What&#39;s the *real* &amp;gt;!austin!&amp;lt; subreddit?

edit: perhaps it&#39;s this one &amp;gt;!https://old.reddit.com/r/austincirclejerk/!&amp;lt;</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iitrgdq/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
