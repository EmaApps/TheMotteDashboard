My boyfriend is extremely gullible. Sometimes he&#39;ll send me instagram posts of literal fake news (not really partisan, more like tabloid-esque &#39;the Queen has cancer and 30 days to live&#39; headlines, or &#39;PROOF Rishi Sunak responsible for taking Partygate photos&#39;, ie., things that are plausible but also functionally made-up by the post); he sometimes struggles to tell whether some mockumentaries are fictional until 10-15 minutes in. Objectively he&#39;s very intelligent according to widely held IQ proxies, test scores, grades, his job and so on. But I&#39;m sometimes stunned at his lack of scepticism, I&#39;m actually very worried that one day someone could trick him into a stupid investment or into being mugged by leading him into an alleyway under false pretences or something. 

Do you know people like this (maybe you&#39;re together with one)? Is there a solution or do I just have to live with this concern?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifkwy7m/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
