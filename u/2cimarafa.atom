I think as I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized that the primary reason (at least intellectually, I make no claim to deeper analysis of my subconscious motives) for my continued general agnosticism is that the concept of an afterlife (or really reincarnation or eternal life in any form) just seems too good to be true, and tailor made to what seems like a fundamental human desire for permanence in a world in which none exists. 

This is a relative of, although not quite identical to, the old le atheism “why should your god *specifically* be the one” line of questioning, but it isn’t really meant as a gotcha. Only that it should seem awfully convenient, terrified of death that we are, that life (in some form) goes on. I am quite confident that higher powers than ourselves exist in our universe. They may even care what happens here, though I’m less certain of that. But that they should be so attuned to taking care of our greatest fear would appear to be a stroke of luck too far.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ieq8zqf/"/></entry></feed>
