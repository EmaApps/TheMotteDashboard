I&#39;ve broken it up into two easily digestible chunks.   


[Part 1](https://youtu.be/M409oKluPYc) mostly goes into the nexus between psychology and econ/business. If you were pursuing behavioral econ, is that better accomplished in an econ department or psych department? Neither, try business school. The downside of general news consumption, as opposed to hobby or industry-specific news, is also covered.  


[Part 2](https://youtu.be/kQOBYOlQ_Jg) goes into pop culture consolidation, i.e. the endless reboots and franchise sequels/spinoffs. (This appears to be true even of video games and books.) There is some discussion of methodology, i.e. is a Nintendo game that features Mario at all part of the Super Mario Bros. Video Game Universe? Oligopoly in general is also touched on.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilmyik2/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
