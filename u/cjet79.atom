I&#39;m thinking the main step (which I am going to do) is just start writing more stuff. But tactical advice would be appreciated.

I think I specifically want to be a better writer in three areas:

1. Sharing personal stories. This writing will mostly be used to speak with friends and family. Possibly as a diary. Possibly as a dream journal (I have lots of weird dreams, and I think I should start mining some of them for story ideas).
2. Writing fictional stories. I use to write a story in the past. I maybe burned out, or just lost my passion. But at the time I didn&#39;t feel very skilled at it, I&#39;d like to be better if the passion ever takes me again.
3. Op-ed style writing. Things that can be posted as articles and shared online. I&#39;d like them to be interesting, engaging, factual, and hopefully convincing.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijeczy5/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
