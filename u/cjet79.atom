1. Has progression elements. Buying upgrades, gaining experience, etc.
2. Has skill elements. Like an FPS, action rpg, or some other game that requires some skill.
3. You can become God like. By the end of it I want my cumulative game skill and upgrades to make the game stupidly easy. Slaughtering foes without a thought, and only the hardest of bosses presenting the slightest challenge.

I can find plenty of games with the first two elements. It&#39;s the third element that is difficult to find.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/iian6cu/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
