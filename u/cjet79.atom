It is a vampire survival game. You build forts, hunt down people for their blood, fight bosses, and unlock gear to improve your character.

I&#39;ve had a decent amount of fun, but I&#39;ve also been at war with the game&#39;s expected way of playing. 

V Rising is meant to be a multiplayer game. All of the default game and difficulty settings are meant for multiplayer. A boss that might be fodder in front of three players is nearly impossible alone. There are also built in time and resource sinks, which require quite a bit of grinding. Some of those time and resource sinks are shared sinks. So if you build a castle for you and your friends to keep that castle running you need to collect &#34;blood essence&#34;. But its a shared sink, so if you need 1000 blood essence a night then that is 1000 blood essence if you are alone, and 200 blood essence if you split it with 4 other players. There are other similar resource and time sinks that become strictly easier with more people.

Anyways, its hard for me to convince my friends to play games with me. My idea of a commitment to play together is averaging 1-2 hours a night playing the game. Their idea of a commitment to play together is two hours a week (and no more time spent, because then I will get too far ahead of them).

So I play the game in single player mode. I had to start over after my first playthrough because even though I made all the settings easier on myself, I didn&#39;t go nearly far enough. Kudos to V Rising for allowing me to change the settings. But I can&#39;t help but be a little annoyed that great multiplayer games feel shut off to me.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v3s27m/friday_fun_thread_for_june_03_2022/ib2wft2/"/></entry></feed>
