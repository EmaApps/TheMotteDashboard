Thanks again to everyone that left suggestions. I started with [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), suggested by u/S18656IFL. And I&#39;ve been loving the game. But after about a dozen hours of gameplay I&#39;ve started trying to mod the game. I want MORE POWER! And I&#39;m doing it by adding more levels to the meta power system, and trying to give myself more rooms to go through for each level. I will either break this game or achieve ultimate power.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij2pval/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
