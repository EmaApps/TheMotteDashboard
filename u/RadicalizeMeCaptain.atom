This boggles my mind. The only explanation I can think of is that they&#39;re trying to be sensitive to the visually impaired, but even that makes no sense. A person who was born blind has no idea what color is and will never be able to comprehend it. A person who lost their vision later in life probably wouldn&#39;t care what anyone at the table looks like, because they&#39;re there to exchange ideas. Moreover, if the goal is to tell people what you look like, then why focus on clothing? Do the people responsible for this custom have such limited visual imagination that they think a person&#39;s appearance can be compressed down to a handful of assumptions based on gender and color of clothing? (Come to think of it, that sounds like [Corporate Memphis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Memphis). Maybe there&#39;s a connection there)

Any explanation or steelman would be appreciated.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ii0uqkg/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
