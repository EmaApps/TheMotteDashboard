Trapped as in &#34;I&#39;d be killing myself tomorrow&#34; were my parents dead. They&#39;re not, so I can&#39;t. Don&#39;t know what to do with myself.

No career, no CV, no friends. Not that I alienated them, a little of that, but mostly,  I had few friends, and they all drifted away after I dropped out of uni.  Before that, friends from high school drifted away because I went to another city for uni.No context anymore, and I felt ashamed too. I don&#39;t feel like getting to know any people. There&#39;s nothing I can offer them, and where would I get to know them anyway ? Gym ? People go there to exercise, not to socialise.

Longer re-statement of my malfunction in a reply to this.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if5qk02/"/></entry></feed>
