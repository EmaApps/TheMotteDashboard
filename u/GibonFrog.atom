It not only captured my attention, but clearly the attention of the whole section of twitter with several &#39;banger&#39; (viral) tweets. 

This is actually an interesting coincidence, as the target audience of such an account somewhat overlaps with the reader of BAM (Bronze Age Mindset) -- a book I just finished reading. Because of this, I was able to get many of the references. 

Whats interesting about these two events -- both reading the book and stumbling on this side of twitter -- is that I am discovering a new kind of emerging right wing. I feel like this right wing is distinct from the lame and crusty right that contained people such as Bush and Romney, but I also feel like it is distinct from the annoying right that contained people such as Trump and his followers. It feels more *with it* and intellectual than both. Because of this, while still niche, I feel like this flavor of rw politics can compete with the current mainstream left wing politics.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iiqqpw9/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
