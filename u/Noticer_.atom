I’ve been watching some YouTubers who like to forecast world events, and they’re all seemingly blaring red alert that we are in for a major rough patch of human history, and they’ve been like that for months now.

Pretty screwed right now, with high energy prices and low productivity the new standard for them. Can they survive with their current standards of living intact? Same goes double for China, with the one child policy and mass corruption causing them to over count their population to the tune of a one hundred million, constant Covid lockdowns, and an insane housing bubble leading to one of the worlds worst economic calamities on the horizon.
