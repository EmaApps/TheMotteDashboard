I&#39;ll ask one more time, hoping that maybe this time it&#39;ll get more eyeballs, then commit myself to silence:

Is there a modern expansion or critique to Popper&#39;s &#34;Open Society and Its Enemies&#34;?

I&#39;ve found his arguments strongly convincing. Even if I disregard the large part about historicism, the open/individual vs closed/collectivist model continue to make sense to me.

I wonder if someone picked up his ideas and continued to develop them? Or if someone found flaws?

I know Soros published some books in the same area (open society/capitalism reform), but haven&#39;t looked at any of them yet.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wnz8wv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_14_2022/ikeni69/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
