He was going to “build the wall and deport them all.” That’s why he was elected, not because of “wokeness,” or “liberal elites,” or to end foreign wars or whatever. 

And yet that’s been almost entirely forgotten in the years since. Trump’s presidency was a resounding failure on the anti-immigration front, so maybe that’s why. 

But for whatever reason, today immigration has fallen almost completely by the wayside compared to 2016. On both sides. The daily “Trump bad” pieces in the media are rarely about immigrants anymore, they’re about Trump’s “erosion of democratic norms” or SCOTUS or whatever.

I think abortion is a similar issue because, like &quot;equality,&quot; people on &quot;both sides of the issue&quot; today share much more common ground than they think, and are thoroughly blinkered as a result. 

The “anti-abortion” side is pretty straightforward, at least ostensibly. “Human life is sacred, fetus is human life, therefore no kill.” 

The “pro-abortion” side cannot dispute the idea that human life qua human life, that is, individual members of the biological species *homo sapiens*, is sacred and inherently worthy protecting.
