There doesn&#39;t seem to be any low-level way to access it and DBAN it. Do you think just writing a script to fill it to the brim with txt files a few times over would do the trick?

Nothing too crazy but more than I&#39;d be comfortable with just sitting around in a checking account. How would you suggest &#34;storing&#34; it? Mutual funds? Multiple approaches to &#34;diversify&#34; against single point of failure?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/iflhxov/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
