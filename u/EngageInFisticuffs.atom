They are harmful for arguments.

I recently read a post that was about one subject, mentioned something else as a point of comparison, and resulted in a conversation that was dominated by the metaphorical comparison rather than the subject level issue.

The entire point of metaphors is comparison of two very different things that have certain similarities. In the case of contention, what those similarities are is also likely to come under contention. Many of the metaphors on here turn into argument over the technicalities of the metaphor rather than the object-level issue. 

That has a lot to do with the type of audience you get here, but it still illustrates that metaphors themselves can conceal as much as they reveal. Or even just emphasize and deemphasize certain aspects of the subject. While this is great for rhetoric, it does no favors for clarity of argument.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/imp4pty/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
