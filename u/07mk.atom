It seems that he had an issue with the proposition that &#34;1 x 1 = 1&#34; and thus sought to disprove it; here&#39;s a quotation from an argument he claimed he had with a professor:

&amp;gt; How can it equal one? If one times one equals one that means that two is of no value because one times itself has no effect. One times one equals two because the square root of four is two, so what&#39;s the square root of two? Should be one, but we&#39;re told it&#39;s two, and that cannot be.

Apparently he had such a problem with the regular math being taught there that he dropped out of college. I don&#39;t know how much work into Terryology he&#39;s done, but he&#39;s talked about spending time constructing (physical plastic) models to prove his new &#34;math&#34; and once [Tweeted a &#34;proof&#34; of why one times one cannot equal one](https://twitter.com/terrencehoward/status/925754491881877507) in an apparent bid to appease his critics. It&#39;s only 4 pages long, but I&#39;ll admit I could only put in the effort to skim it because of how poor the quality of writing was. But to me it seems that he just lacks a fundamental ability to grasp what addition and multiplication are and ends up confusing the 2 with each other. I was reminded of a podcast I listened to many years ago wherein a physicist being interviewed mentioned how his office gets mail all the time from people claiming to have found some huge breakthrough that would revolutionize the field, and when he happened to read one of them, it showed that the writer had no understanding of momentum and velocity and kept confusing the 2.

Also, [apparently Terrence has discovered some new form of physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44pljnxztg) involving hydrogen bonds that will enable a new way of flying. I don&#39;t know if this is directly related to Terryology or if it&#39;s a completely independent thing he came up with.

I don&#39;t know much about Terrence outside him being an actor, but clearly he&#39;s an extremely successful one. Say what you will about him losing out on the MCU gravy train, but being a major character in even 1 major Hollywood production like *Iron Man* is a level of success that the vast majority of actors can ever dream about. It&#39;s just fascinating to me that someone with this poor an understanding of math, to the extent that addition and multiplication are beyond his grasp, has been able to be not just this functional, but this successful in modern society. Then again, acting isn&#39;t a particularly math-heavy profession, and it&#39;s possible that he hires professionals to handle his finances. It&#39;s just, if he thinks what those professionals are doing is all false made-up bullshit, how does he trust them at all to do what&#39;s right for him?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x3t1mp/friday_fun_thread_for_september_02_2022/imss3of/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
