The author claims that what a mother should be is actually &#34;socialised&#34; behaviour sold through various disciplines from theology to science, with its earliest archetypes extending to biblical accounts of Mary and Eve, and later fortified by Darwin and other evolutionary theorists as the intellectual domain drifted away from faith. It stirred quite a blowback, and a [rebuttal](https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/08/28/is-maternal-instinct-a-misogynistic-myth/#comments) from Jerry Coyne.

I think its worth discussing why any archetype of maternity is frowned upon as regressive and demeaning towards women. There seems to be a section in hyper progressive academia that thinks that gender roles need to be reversed to &#34;right historical wrongs&#34;, in society, in film, etc. Maybe its just votebank politics, maybe corporations want to discourage family priorities through mass media. I&#39;m not quite sure how this division of consumer demographics between the sexes will end, especially at a time when birth rates are falling and the American establishment is realising that its global unipolarity has ended with an ascendant China, an uppity India and a vengeful Russia on the horizon. Culture wars at home do not project unity abroad.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im8a4cm/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
