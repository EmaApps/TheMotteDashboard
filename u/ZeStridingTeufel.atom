And Chinese social media is [not happy](https://twitter.com/003CarrierFan/status/1554479124726546432?cxt=HHwWgICwgeWhz5IrAAAA).

It seems that China currently lacks the amphibious capabilities to launch a full scale successful attack on Taiwan for the moment, but given the track record of the PLA&#39;s development, this capability *might* be achieved within 5 years. Xi cannot be seen as a toothless tiger however, I think he might attempt to capture an island in the Taiwan Strait to declare a moral victory. I&#39;m also wondering how this could impact Biden&#39;s approval at home if he&#39;s truly seen as standing up to China after humiliating failures in bringing the iron curtain down on Russia.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iinm4z4/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
