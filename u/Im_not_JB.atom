Kicker: don&#39;t know what state we&#39;re going to yet. We&#39;re currently trying to juggle a couple job offers. How do people manage moving to a different state when you already have a significant amount of stuff? (Prior moves have either been small amounts of stuff or to a place where we already had a domicile.)

I think the traditional thing is to go and scope out a place, get it arranged to rent or whatever, maybe live out of a hotel and work there some while your family stays back where you used to live, and so on. We&#39;re renting, and while we have some flexibility, we want to just leave this place pretty quickly. We&#39;re considering doing PODS, just packing up basically everything, having them store them in a facility somewhere, then live out of suitcases in an AirBNB in the new area for a few weeks or a month or whatever until we decide on and negotiate a new place to live.

Has anyone done this? Even if not, any thoughts?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im9jjgo/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
