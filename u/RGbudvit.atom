It&#39;s a little odd to me that one of the main mechanisms of business and one of the key ways states control industry seems to have so little focus.

Edit - there doesn&#39;t seem to be such a critique and I am not doing the best job of explaining my issue. Thanks folks I&#39;ll come back to this later if I can martial my thoughts more coherently.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im4v7tx/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
