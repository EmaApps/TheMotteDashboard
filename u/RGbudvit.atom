I&#39;ve written some books, nothing amazing and nothing I&#39;m going to tell you about here.

I had this thought though and a question follows from it - AI is writing an awful lot of stuff. 

My question is - 

What measures have the creators of AI made to make sure they either don&#39;t violate my copyright or where they do but under fair use they attribute correctly to myself/another author?

Similar questions related to artwork spring to mind - are the AI blocked from creating already existing and protected images?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/il8e07e/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
