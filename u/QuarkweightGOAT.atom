Week 2/60 is behind me. Not much to report. Water fasted Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and today. 2 more weeks until I begin resistance training and trying to put on muscle. Shedding fat at a crazy rate but perceptibly losing muscle mass as well as to be expected. I can notice a tiny bit of loose skin around my abdomen in dim lighting but not as bad as I feared. No clue whether fasting is helping on that front but still seems worthwhile since I am leaning out so fast. Am extremely eager to hit the weights in a few weeks. I will post before once I am done dieting in a few weeks.

Current plan is to fast Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday next week. Then Monday, Tuesday, eat maintenance on Wednesday and then conclude with a 4-day fast to complete my leaning out phase. After that I will slowly reintroduce calories until I get to a calculated maintenance for a week or two and then lift at a small caloric surplus. 

Will report back next week.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifofoo2/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
