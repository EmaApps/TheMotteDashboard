Anyone have experience with them, or tips in general for buying a first house? In particular I&#39;m wondering whether I need a realtor to negotiate a deal with them to buy a townhouse under construction. With how busy I am, it&#39;s been difficult to find many resources for getting started with my first house.

The place costs \~$500k and I&#39;m pretty much just buying it as an investment (though living there will be very nice compared to my current \~550 sqr ft apartment)</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v2a9l4/wellness_wednesday_for_june_01_2022/iaspmn8/"/></entry></feed>
