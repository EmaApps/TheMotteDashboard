In particular, why does there seem to be little to no interest in systems that make branching easier?  Yes, interested users can roll their own outside the game (eg, using a version control system to manage a game&#39;s save files), but doing that outside of the game itself limits its effectiveness in a lot of ways.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ijzpibv/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
