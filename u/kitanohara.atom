&amp;gt; Performing two runs of the same program results in “twice as much” conscious experience as one run

This doesn&#39;t make sense to me, I&#39;d be thankful if you fight me on this. If we assume substrate independence (as they do), what exactly might it mean for a conscious experience to be in identical copies?

I have a intuition that if such copying is possible on the substrate level, this alone doesn&#39;t make the experience itself duplicate or multiply. And that this is true for any relevant definition of duplication I can think of, including those that matter morally. I also have an intuition that you can only start saying there&#39;s &#34;more than one&#34; conscious experience to the extent that instances become different from each other. No idea how to argue for something like this though, and also no idea how to integrate this with my other ethical intuitions...</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v053ii/smallscale_question_sunday_for_may_29_2022/iafupkx/"/></entry></feed>
