Unfortunately, this was made under iprayiam2, and as far as I can tell the original conversation is lost (at least my half of the conversation). Therefore, I can&#39;t and won&#39;t hold the original bet accountable, but I&#39;d love to know if the other party remembers our exchange.

The jist was something close to: 

*Between September 2022 and March 2023, there will be at least three different places within the US, which have a mask mandate policy at some point inside of that timeframe.*

I know it&#39;s a little early, but recent news about many schools renewing their mandates for the fall brought this to mind, and thus I am almost guaranteed I will win. (I even expect to win if you only include broader public mandates, but in either case, forcing public school children or folks on a college campus of public universities to comply surely counts anyway.)

Anyone remember making that bet with me?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iip09be/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
