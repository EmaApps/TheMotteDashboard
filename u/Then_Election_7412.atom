In general, it seems comparable to DALLE2, Imagen, and Parti, beating them in some ways and losing to them in others; the most general comment I&#39;d offer is that it seems to do worse with semantic content and better with textures. This isn&#39;t too important: the next generation (which is to say, 6-12 months from now) will beat all of them in all their best aspects.

Aside from a lot of verbiage around using it ethically, the official and publicly hosted version includes a safety classifier that removes bad outputs. Yay? Of course, since it&#39;s open source, it&#39;s easy enough to modify the code, and the world got right to it. We already have the UnstableDiffusion and PornDiffusion subreddits, and there will be an proliferation of them and their content in the coming months without the need to dance around the OpenAI and Google ~~blacklists~~ blocklists. I mentioned this to a friend, and she said that at least we&#39;ll have a couples years before we could supply images of a person and have porn generated from them. I didn&#39;t have the heart to point her to [textual-inversion](https://textual-inversion.github.io/). Who&#39;d have thought porn actresses would be some of the first to fall to AI? If it&#39;s any consolation to them, many other occupations are going to be wiped out in the coming first wave.

It seems like society is not just unprepared for this but unaware of how far along we are in the automated generation of digital content. For awhile it seemed like the hope was that professional gatekeepers would protect us, but it was obvious that strategy just needed a single defector to fail. If it wasn&#39;t Stability, it&#39;d have been Yandex. If it wasn&#39;t Yandex, it would be a leak.

Regardless, now the cat is out of the bag. I don&#39;t think there was or is any way to prevent or stop this, or even that it&#39;s bad that it&#39;s happening. What does seem likely is that we&#39;re in for a rough ride as society reacts to something that&#39;s blindsided it.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ile306e/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
