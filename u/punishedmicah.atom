Really neat article about the way pain functions. Situated a lot of things into context for me. 

Does anyone have reading recommendation talking about the way our brains act in moments of acute stress, from a somewhat larger angle? One thing I want to cultivate is calmness in times of crisis.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if2tf3d/"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if2h0sf/</id><title type="text">[WW] Started getting into olympic weightlifting.

It&#39;s a fun thing to organize my strength training around, and the incredibly technical nature of the snatch/clean-and-jerk would probably appeal to a lot of y&#39;all. So many layers to dig into with these two moves. 

It&#39;s a great sport because it requires strength, balance, flexibility and a Motte-level obsession with analysis and details.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if2h0sf/"/></entry></feed>
