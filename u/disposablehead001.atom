I do pretty well with women irl but getting them to the first date is a struggle. I also don’t have enough matches to feel like I can I get in decent practice. I was ghosted by a cool match (into Feynman and nuclear energy, be still my heart) and I’m pretty sure I made two or three errors that killed that convo. When I get my next exciting match in 3-9 months, I don’t want to fuck it up again, but I expect I will because I don’t have a way to stay in form.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vxw6lz/wellness_wednesday_for_july_13_2022/ifzla0z/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
