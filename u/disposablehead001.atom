I’m going to again soon, and I’m trying to formulate a list of stuff I know well enough and would actually be available. I’m essentially down to 90’s-00’s rap hits and some Sinatra songs. Any recommendations?

Btw [Hot in Herre](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GeZZr_p6vB8) still holds up.

Motivation was a big obstacle academically, but my scores had an upward trajectory after I started bupropion + methylphenidate. Another year of living in the boonies, then I get to move to a better spot for clinicals. 

Im trying to minimize my exposure to video games, as I get sucked in and lose days of my life. Thanks Stellaris. I’m training for a cycling race, trying to read a book a week, and have a part-time research gig to keep me busy. Dating is the one big complaint, and while the local scene sucks, I’m going to try and get out to social settings more often this summer, more for the practice than anything else.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v2a9l4/wellness_wednesday_for_june_01_2022/iasz8wc/"/></entry></feed>
