My wife has an extreme reaction to them. For me, if I can ignore a mosquito bite for half an hour, it goes away. For my wife, it gets worse, becoming a raised red welt the next day.

Applying benadryl or hydrocortisone cream doesn&#39;t seem to provide much relief. About the only thing she&#39;s found is to apply ice, but that&#39;s a very short-term effect and doesn&#39;t address the underlying problem.

I wonder why there&#39;s no treatment (afaik) for desensitization, like we do for allergies.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v2a9l4/wellness_wednesday_for_june_01_2022/iatuu06/"/></entry></feed>
