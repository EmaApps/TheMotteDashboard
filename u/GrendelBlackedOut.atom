I hate exercising. It brings me no pleasure whatsoever. I would, however, like to have as much high quality time with my wife and kids as possible. My current cardio routine consists of running a 5k on a treadmill twice a week (typical time \~23:30-24 minutes) and a 5-mile outdoor run perhaps once every 3-4 weeks (typical time \~40-42 minutes). Is there any incremental utility in running more or could I be happy just maintaining this?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/if2s33v/"/></entry></feed>
