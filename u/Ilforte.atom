Stable Diffusion, the AI model for text-to-image generation funded by stability.ai&#39;s mysterious deep-pocketed sponsors, is live, for now accessible to beta users through a Discord bot; model checkpoint will be released soon.  
It&#39;s more wonky than DALL-E 2, noticeably «dumber» than something like Google Imagen or Parti when it comes to understanding composition or conceptual merging (likely because it doesn&#39;t contain a standalone text encoder model), lazier (in that it leans towards low-order [gluing-things-together](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005597086756122644/1005652508036845568/cat_with_bird_wings_-S_244964435_ts-1659836641_idx-0.png), [like Dall-e 2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32342550) but worse, and filter-like style transfer), with a number of unfortunate failure modes dictated by badly filtered dataset (cut-off heads because images cropped to square can have all the right tags!), and far inferior to Midjourney in out-of-the-box aesthetic quality.  
...But it is the most powerful model we can expect to be able to run on consumer hardware in the foreseeable future, **by far**; it will keep getting better (by upgrading from its naive classifier-free guidance, at least in forks); it will be adopted, adapted and finetuned by companies like Midjourney; and it doesn&#39;t engage in censorship (though Discord owners *will* bonk you for stuff they don&#39;t like; read Emad&#39;s announcements).   

And it&#39;s so, so very inhumanly broad (taking its stated size of like 5 GB into account), it keeps blowing my mind. It has a reasonably good knowledge of... well, everything, every bit of visual trash we&#39;ve put on the interwebs over the years, from Unreal Engine *interface* screenshots to Big Chungus and Gigachad memes to styles of particular digital era artists to dumb American celeb portraits and anime waifus; with a disappointingly strong bias towards normie interests, but also a stunning ability to reach coherence, even photorealism – not only is it broad, but it has straight up *memorized* a ton of stuff, to the point it discards less definite aspects (consider [&#34;painting by Edmund Blair Leighton of a beautiful barmaid in old silky clothes sitting on the floor, looking sad, detailed face, touching her clothes and her face, the interior of a medieval castle in the background, 4k oil on linen by Edmund Blair Leighton, highly detailed, soft lighting 8k resolution&#34;](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005595971306127470/1005639368322588863/painting_by_Edmund_Blair_Leighton_of_a_beautiful_barmaid_in_old_silky_clothes_sitting_on_the_floor_looking_sad_detailed_face_touching_her_clothes_and_her_-n_9_-S_2965080456_ts-1659833507_idx-0.png) or [HDRI of Nier Automata landscape, Unreal Engine, Artstation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005596415755554866/1005653583062106213/HDRI_of_Nier_Automata_landscape_Unreal_Engine_Artstation_-W_1024_-n_9_-S_3050328502_ts-1659836890_idx-0.png)). 

And it&#39;s *not* hopeless to keep playing around with prompt wording and arguments (particularly after finding [a nice seed](https://twitter.com/TomLikesRobots/status/1555466892759941122) – it is *unbelievably* obedient to the seed, consider these iterations [1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005626617982357614/1005655065383669811/Detailed_masterpiece_concept_art_of_Cyberpunk_Princess_Zelda_in_a_gritty_world_hyperdetailed_concept_art_by_Ross_Tran_and_Greg_Rutkowski_hig_-H_768_-C_3.0_-s_120_-S_4145381887_ts-1659837249_idx-0.png), [2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005626617982357614/1005655300302458990/Detailed_masterpiece_concept_art_of_Cyberpunk_Princess_Zelda_in_a_gritty_world_hyperdetailed_concept_art_by_Ross_Tran_and_Greg_Rutkowski_high_quali_-H_768_-C_6.0_-S_4145381887_ts-1659837306_idx-0.png), [3](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1005626617982357614/1005655540506050681/Detailed_masterpiece_concept_art_of_Princess_Zelda_in_a_gritty_fantasy_world_hyperdetailed_concept_art_by_Ross_Tran_and_Greg_Rutkowski_high_quality_DnD_il_-H_768_-S_4145381887_ts-1659837364_idx-0.png)), because the search space is vast; you may well discover a stunning gem in the multidimensional sea of ugly machine nonsense.

Unlike Midjourney which can make up its own story out of any sequence of characters (usually by defaulting to the characteristic cyan-magenta-orange «pretty» palette, cute women and some blurry castles in the mountains, or to «abstract symmetries»), it seems to play better with maximalist prompting (i.e. specifying as many attributes as possible).

In case somebody still doubted: the age of creative post-scarcity is here. This is not a drill. This will not be contained. This will not hit a wall.
