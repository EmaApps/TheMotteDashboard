Darya Dugina, the daughter of the philosopher and Culture Warrior [Alexander Dugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dugin) whom I&#39;ve been sporadically translating here over these years, was killed some hours ago. Maybe it&#39;s a traffic accident, but then it seems to be [of the explosive kind](https://www.thedailybeast.com/darya-dugina-daughter-of-putin-propagandist-alexander-dugin-killed-in-car-bomb-reports-say).

She was a member of the «International Eurasianist movement», with all that entails (e.g a LARPy black robe with a golden Chaos star); she was supporting the «special military operation», and got added to American and UK sanction lists. But she likely wasn&#39;t the target: her father ^1 was expected to be in the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving on Mojaiskoe highway near [Bolshiye Vyazyomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshiye_Vyazyomy) in the Moscow Oblast. They were returning from a certain «Tradition» fest.  

Being a high-profile Russian Nationalist is a reliable way to cut your life expectancy. Igor Shafarevich had made it to 93, dying in 2017, but he had always been built differently. In the two Covid years preceding the Z day, it&#39;s been getting rough. Eduard Limonov: March 2020, 77. Konstantin Krylov died in May 2020, aged 52, from a stroke. Maxim Martsinkevich [got suicided](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/iseo9j/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_september_14/g5n3d1i/) in prison in September 2020; he was 36. [Egor Prosvirnin](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/rphmgp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_december_27/hqq1tfi/), as I&#39;ve reported before, had flown out of the window and crashed into the asphalt on December 27th, 2021, at 35. Darya was 30.  
I&#39;m reading another Darya sometimes: Kozeko, Yale-educated, @digitalgonzo96 (account inactive). She comments on boylove fiction and local sushi restaurants, opportunistically wages «information warfare» and complains about shelling noise and water supply breakdowns. She&#39;s living in Donetsk. Probably I won&#39;t be reading any new Kozeko at some point in the not too distant future.  

As for Dugina, the obvious suspicion falls on Ukrainian agents, aided by Western intel, or perhaps on their local sympathizers. Ukrainians have demonstrated their capacity to carry out assassinations *on the outskirts of Moscow* [years ago](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2016/09/20/ukrainian-separatist-murdered-in-moscow-restaurant-a55399) – though Russia pointedly refuses to consider that one politically motivated. 

Logically speaking, Galkovsky&#39;s family is next. Holmogorov, Krasovsky or Prilepin are more immediately deserving, but they&#39;re more directly state-affiliated, and thus presumably harder targets. Maybe Olshansky, Kashin and some other journalists of that sort are on the kill list. ^2

I wonder if they&#39;ll come for translators. 

More generally, I think this should be taken as a good message for reactionaries and conservative contrarians everywhere, TradCaths, groypers, alt/dissident-rightists of whatever is the current euphemism; all sorts of political Platonists who think and act as if the world can bend to their mind, like Dugin&#39;s sensei and alchemist Golovin taught. A very old-school, Kipling-style message, in the case QANON, Jan 6th and its consequences weren&#39;t enough for everybody over there.  
You&#39;re not playing games when you exercise your wordsmithing ability in public. Be cautious of your wishes coming true. This world is physical and unforgiving, an arena where sober-headed causality engineers wrestle with brute chance, emergent complexity and each other; posing as Gigachads and portraying your better-organized opponents as crying Soyjaks will earn you nothing but misery in the long run. Wars are won not with spirit and meme magic and Idealism but with boring stuff like skills, manpower, logistics and strategy. Including wars of the mind! When you fight a war, even a Culture war, it&#39;s obscene to treat it as a game.  
Alexander Heliyevich Dugin has been playing word games all his life and got lost in their rhizomatic abyss, a perpetually edgy boy with an uncanny and uneven erudition, although adorned with a solid grey beard (by the way, he&#39;s only 60 despite his looks, a decade younger than his clean-shaven, botoxed, small-minded God-Czar; this *starchestvo*, performative embrace of the aging process, is a political statement). He has already lost more than his sanity. Most likely it&#39;ll be easier for him to spin this loss into another ^3 bitter cause for doubling down than to admit having been fundamentally wrong. Don&#39;t be like Alexander Heliyevich Dugin, if you can. The real world deserves being taken seriously.

**1:** To make it clear: I think assassinating Dugin is fair game, though perhaps not worth the effort. He&#39;s a warmonger and he considers philosophy to be a form of combat, and the highest form at that. Indeed, the last post on his vk.com account (predating the event by half a day) begins with: 

&amp;gt; Mental warfare should be handled by people with a high quality of mentality. That is, above all, philosophers. After all, we are talking about Noomakhia, **wars of the mind**. In my opinion, to put this in the context of the Defense Ministry is grotesque and absurd.  

Philosophy aside, he has always directly encouraged the violence and, what offends me more, the escapist fantasy of prevailing through the denial of «Titanism», even resorting to clear tomfoolery (On the subject of import substitution: «There will be a lot of products from Belarus. Even more than now. Including textiles and cosmetics. **And also washbasins**. But Belarus will be the State of the Empire». What?). Half a year ago, back when I was still [in denial](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/sgv76g/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_january_31/hvqh1kw/) about the impending war, he was clamoring for the ruination of Ukraine, and he deserves his label as the [intellectual father of Russian Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashism#Aleksandr_Dugin). 

I used to find those extreme aspects of him clownish, mere delusion of an ideologue who&#39;s been used and discarded by a corrupt bureaucratic apparatus he glamorizes. But it turns out that a clown mafia state can still try to act out esoteric fascism. Like they say: «It looked like we&#39;ve punched through the rock bottom; then we&#39;ve heard knocking from below». 

**2:** Solovyev&#39;s death would be satisfying to hear about, but [one alleged attempt](https://meduza.io/feature/2022/06/21/dva-mesyatsa-nazad-fsb-ob-yavila-o-sryve-pokusheniya-na-vladimira-solovieva) had already failed; and I&#39;m afraid he&#39;s the type to repent, be graciously forgiven and get his assets back, proceeding to bang empty-headed Russian Studies co-eds and write cringe-inducing lit crit and mawkish memoirs until his centennial anniversary. (Then again, that&#39;s what *Westerners* can offer him; Ukrainians are a healthy Eastern European people, somewhat cruder. And they&#39;re getting into their «the only good Russian is a dead Russian» mindset deep enough to train their pitchforks on [Maxim Katz](https://youtu.be/ZMNIHvuaG8U) now).  

**3:** an excerpt from Dugin&#39;s interview in *Moskovsky Komsomolets*, a rather free-wheeling outlet, titled «“Solar” Putin has defeated “Lunar” one», Mar 30: 

&amp;gt; – Alexander Gellievich, I was rereading one of your interviews about the existence of two Putins. «Solar» and «Lunar.» «Solar» is [about] Crymnash (Crimea Ours), the restoration of the Eurasian empire, messianism. «Lunar» is a rational practitioner, a realist, an adherent of capitalist economy, acting with regard to the collective West. At the time, you lamented that Putin just won&#39;t commit to the «Solar» path, preferring to combine both. And how is it today – has the choice been made?

&amp;gt; – Yes, of course, the «Solar« Putin has won, and I&#39;ve been saying that he would win not a year ago, but for many years in a row. I have even published a book about this, «Putin vs Putin», dedicated to the main paradox of Russian politics – it has been translated into many languages and in it I present my theory in detail. 

&amp;gt; There is an interesting author in historical science, Ernst Kantorovich, who wrote a study called «The Two Bodies of the King». It is about the fact that any great ruler is always dual. On the one hand, physically, he is certainly a man, and on the other hand, he is a historical figure, part of a continuous historical process. As a man, he can think in a certain way; but as a historical figure on which the fate of peoples and states depend, he may act very differently.  

&amp;gt; This duality creates the deepest tension, the drama of the ruler, and is characteristic of a variety of political regimes. It does not matter whether we are dealing with democracy, as in the case of Churchill or Roosevelt, or with monarchy, as under Ivan the Terrible or Nicholas II. It is a split that arises in the soul and in the heart, in the consciousness of the ruler, when he is truly aware of his responsibility before history, when the future of humanity depends on his actions and his decisions made with reliance on himself and his destiny, on the depths of his «I».

&amp;gt; An ordinary, normal person acts rationally, by inertia – this is what I call the «Lunar» side. He adapts to circumstances and recognizes the rules of the game, follows moral and ethical norms.

&amp;gt; The «Solar» side, on the other hand, compels him to perform a great deed. In the image of our president this is expressed very vividly.

&amp;gt; On the one hand, Putin is devoted to the sovereignty of Russia as a state, but on the other, rational hand I think he was well aware of the consequences of a persistent insistence on his position. In this respect, Putin&#39;s «Solar» beginning is extremely tragic, because it means struggle with the ideas and values of the West. **But Russia has crossed the Rubicon, which I am personally very happy about.**</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/il4zgw1/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
