Apologies if I&#39;m mistaken.  

Lynching.  I&#39;m trying to understand the extent and severity.  Is there a good resource for understanding the historical phenomenon as it occurred in the United States?  Hopefully with some high level of detail and specificity?  I am of the impression that it&#39;s incredibly inflated in the minds of modern individuals - occurring a few thousand times over the course of a century, to people of various ethnicities.  Most specifically, I am interested in the reasonableness (for lack of a better word) of the actions.  Extrajudicial violence is, in and of itself, somewhat unreasonable a priori, but how many victims were random citizens taken off the street, and how many were communally killed before the legal system would have (likely) found them guilty of the alleged crimes?  Is there any accounting of this?  Is looking for as much frivolous?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihgvakg/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
