What&#39;s interesting is that the gas seems to have completely run out of covid as a scary monster.  The press team is trying to treat this as if it&#39;s a major story that they need to provide updates on - Karine gave a long explanation of his current condition, and earlier today Biden gave a [incredibly bizarre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhR0w2eFFSI) talk about gas prices that seems intended to sortof play up how sick he is.  Why in gods name does this look like he&#39;s reporting from a cave in Afghanistan?  They literally built him an entire game show set to do these sorts of things from in the white house.  My guess is that they&#39;re trying to build some sort of story of him overcomi...</a></blockquote></div></div><div class="p-2 flex flex-col md:flex-row  bg-red-50" title="Culture War"><div class="font-mono flex flex-col w-32"><a class="text-xs text-gray-400" target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih704dz/?sort=confidence"><span title="2022-07-22 14:36:53 UTC">Jul 22, 14:36 UTC</span></a><div class="mt-0.5 text-xs overflow-hidden text-gray-600"><code><a href="u/rokosbasilica">u/rokosbasilica</a></code></div></div><div class="flex-1"><blockquote class="ml-2 pl-2 border-l-2 overflow-hidden hover:border-red-600"><a target="blank" href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih704dz/?sort=confidence" class="extlink">The January 6th hearings are still occurring, and I want to talk about them.

Except...this sounds a lot more like he is just critiquing the phrasing of a speech than anything else. 

I&#39;m reminded of this classic Simpsons clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqDP8SnPVA0

The other &quot;bombshell&quot; is Josh Hawley &quot;fleeing&quot;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rDGnMHNs_Y

Except, again: no he isn&#39;t?  This looks like he&#39;s taking a few quick steps probably to catch up with somebody on the escalator, and then walking next to them to chat.
