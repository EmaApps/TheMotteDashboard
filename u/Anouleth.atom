I went over two years without catching it even when living in the same flat as someone who had it. The first day was Monday, which was really bad. Couldn&#39;t sleep, couldn&#39;t really do anything but lie on the sofa and suffer. 

It&#39;s also hitting me at a particularly rough time in terms of mood. It&#39;s been up and down the past few months, but now it&#39;s really down. Everything seems so miserable and pointless. All my thoughts are wholly negative. It&#39;s not that I can&#39;t appreciate that these thoughts are irrational, they are. But I still can&#39;t get them out of my head, even with my usual distractions.

Not really looking for advice because I wouldn&#39;t make good use of it anyway. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m looking for or what I want, because it feels totally impossible to be happy at this point.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v2a9l4/wellness_wednesday_for_june_01_2022/iaugao4/"/></entry></feed>
