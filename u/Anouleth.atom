Mostly surrounding the gym, my lack of progress, and generally feeling weak, lazy, fat, etc. Weight gain has unfortunately mostly stalled, due to working a physically demanding job with few opportunities to eat... but difficult to escape the belief that any weight gained wouldn&#39;t just be fat anyway. Have started running again with a friend (who has serious problems controlling his weight). I tend to get awful soreness/tightness in my shins, but seems to be getting less bad. Another friend has returned to the gym with me too, which is nice, except that it&#39;s because he broke up with his girlfriend, so it feels a little bit wrong to take pleasure from a bad event like that.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih1erlm/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
