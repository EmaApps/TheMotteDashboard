Pretty bummed out about not getting a specific job. I applied for a a job that was exactly what I was looking for. I had the exact tech stack they were looking for as well. Pay was good too (60k no tax, without bonus, not the US so this is a good pay). 

However, as a part of the interview process, I got handed an &#34;aptitude test&#34;, which was a blatant IQ test. I have never done a real IQ test, but my scores are mensa.no (130), mensa.dk (135). Now I don&#39;t put in too much weight into those numbers but I don&#39;t think I am stupid. My IQ is probably around 120 if we go by proxies of IQ. 

I failed their IQ test hard. They didn&#39;t give me a percentile, but I got 61/100. Mind you this test was a lot harder than standard IQ tests. All the questions were 3-d instead of the normal 2-d patterns. My score was below their minimal threshold. Now are they looking for the next Einstein for a junior role, idk. But I am still quite salty about it. I know IQ has real predictive power over interviews and other proxies, so I got told straight to my face that I am not smart enough, which isn&#39;t pleasant even if you know about it.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vxw6lz/wellness_wednesday_for_july_13_2022/ig03xrr/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifc776u/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Of course this is subjective but;

I think East Asian cuisine (Korean, Chinese, Thai, NOT JAPAN) is a tier above all other regional cuisines. Everytime I catch myself voraciously craving something savory or reflecting on a meal I had long after it&#39;s over, its usually from those cuisines.

I had a Korean meal (rice, kimchi jigae, banchan, spicy fried chicken) yesterday and I can&#39;t get it out of my mind. It ticked all the boxes of sweet, umami, spicy, tangy, fatty, varied textures.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifc776u/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifc4ovs/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Does anyone feel like big social media and social media adjacent companies are s</title><updated>2022-07-08T12:38:15Z</updated><author><name>f3zinker</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">Does anyone feel like big social media and social media adjacent companies are sitting on a goldmine of social science research? 

The recent conversations on Tinder/dating got me thinking that I would really like to see a plot of &#39;average x/10 rating&#39; vs &#39;match rate&#39;. My gut instinct tells me it would be a sigmoid function with the range [0,30].</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifc4ovs/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
