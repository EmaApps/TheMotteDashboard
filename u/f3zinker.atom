I didn&#39;t get any responses from The Motte users (I got some from the other two subs) so I&#39;m posting it here, I think the CW thread might get all the traffic as opposed to the front page. 

Recently there was a post trying to survey the general knowledge of the motte. The post got removed. And various people accused the survey of having various shortcomings, from it being a troll, to OP having some kind of agenda with the questions asked. 

Therefore I created a new survey for general knowledge. 

~~1. Its timed. There are 39 questions. With 35 minutes to answer all of them.~~ 

~~2. They are all multiple choice, with only 1 valid answer.~~

There is a math, CS, geography, history and economics section.

I tried to design the questions such that they can be answered without any niche/esoteric knowledge. I did not include any of my personal pet questions or anything like that and tried to frame the questions such that you can use incomplete knowledge to answer them, as long as you have a rough idea of the mechanisms that guide those fields. 

Feedback appreciated. 

DISCLAIMER: Email only to log in, I can&#39;t see the emails.

________________________

edit - Very controversial. I will count more than one answer to the *vague* questions as correct when I do the final eda. My ultimate goal is to do a subreddit wide survey, not individual survey, so don&#39;t put too much weight into your own score. Add +1 or 2 points because some questions are vague, if you want a rough estimate of your score were the questions less vague.

edit2- Certain questions most people were getting wrong, people are getting right now. Either there is data leakage from the comments, or a different demographic is onto it.
