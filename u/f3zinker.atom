I think East Asian cuisine (Korean, Chinese, Thai, NOT JAPAN) is a tier above all other regional cuisines. Everytime I catch myself voraciously craving something savory or reflecting on a meal I had long after it&#39;s over, its usually from those cuisines.

I had a Korean meal (rice, kimchi jigae, banchan, spicy fried chicken) yesterday and I can&#39;t get it out of my mind. It ticked all the boxes of sweet, umami, spicy, tangy, fatty, varied textures.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifc776u/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifc4ovs/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Does anyone feel like big social media and social media adjacent companies are s</title><updated>2022-07-08T12:38:15Z</updated><author><name>f3zinker</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">Does anyone feel like big social media and social media adjacent companies are sitting on a goldmine of social science research? 

The recent conversations on Tinder/dating got me thinking that I would really like to see a plot of &#39;average x/10 rating&#39; vs &#39;match rate&#39;. My gut instinct tells me it would be a sigmoid function with the range [0,30].</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ifc4ovs/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ietsysm/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Is there a compilation of all the discussions on this sub on urbanism and cars? </title><updated>2022-07-04T15:25:03Z</updated><author><name>f3zinker</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Is there a compilation of all the discussions on this sub on urbanism and cars? Or just some links for me to read through. 

I want to start off with this subs pov because it seems to be a somewhat one-sided politically charged topic and there are a lot of sneaky politics on what should be otherwise objective discussions on the pros and cons of different types of design.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ietsysm/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
