[Creating fake, factually incorrect woke-themed customer complaints.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp1O8flnRr8). And [another example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM7hAND9tP8)

This seems to combine the unique weaknesses of both publicly available AI text generation and &#39;cancel culture&#39;. For the former, the weakness is that, while you can generate text that sounds reasonable at a first glance from someone who knows nothing about the subject, the actual, factual details are all wrong. For the latter, the weakness is a lack of due diligence in assessing the validity of claims of discrimination. Cancel first, think later. (Edit to clarify: I mention all this to make a comparison. I think this method would be far less successful at faking other forms of customer complaints, like asking for refunds, because they would face scrutiny which would reveal incorrect information)

It&#39;s very easy to exploit a zero tolerance attitude towards racism with vexatious accusations, and the technology to carry it out automatically seemingly already exists, waiting for someone to glue the pieces together with a little bit of code and start pointing it at targets. Is this on the cusp of being weaponized? Or perhaps it already has?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1d1vb/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
