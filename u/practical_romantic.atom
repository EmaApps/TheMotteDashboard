I do get jaded and feel some brain fog later in the day but the moment I sit on my desk, it goes away like mist after seeing the morning sun. Same for my gym.

I did 40+ reps on the deadlift and squats on Monday and puked right after my workout due to having eaten nothing all day but 3 bananas. I am constantly hungry, sleep like a baby (slept for legit 10 hours yesterday night) and feel mentally sharp. I can feel my brain peak and dip, something I never could feel before as the entire day was foggy. 

I eat anywhere from 3 to 6 eggs daily. I would feel full at 2 earlier but feel hungry constantly now. My posture is much better. Deadlifts and Lat pulldowns fuck my back muscles up so much that I can feel them all day and they do not let me slouch. I have lost an inch or two off my waist even though I am underweight and gained a kg of weight so it is not fat.

I have done 12 videos on my playlist so far, aim is to get to 42 by the end of this week and ensure that I do 4 hours of solid undistracted work daily without fail or any breaks (by work I just mean Data Structures and Algorithms).

It is not much but I am a level 1 slime so leveling up takes time. Just need to grind and keep action as the default state.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijp7suz/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
