I met my cousin sister and we spent a bunch of time just roaming around the city, talking about stuff. We saw my old school where I spent 11 years. We later went to meet my high school senior who is also my cousins friend. I remember being around that chick and she was quite nice.

I first met her in 2014 as a 14 year old in 9th grade and immediately made fun of her. My cousin herself met her a few years later. This senior of mine shared a cigarette with me and we all discussed our struggles in life with parents who have sky high academic expectations. It was cathartic and easily the highlight of my month.

I am in good hands now, I workout almost daily, try to work, see my psychiatrist on time and am trying my best. I still like that history girl but for now I need a job plus research gig. Hopefully I meet her after i get this stuff done by the end of the year and complete that chapter of my life too.

Thanks to everyone on r/TheMotte it has been a pleasure to grow up here.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x261n8/wellness_wednesday_for_august_31_2022/ingc4la/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
