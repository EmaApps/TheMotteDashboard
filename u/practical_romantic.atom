Janmashtami is the day when Lord Krishna was born. He is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and is one of the most beloved deity.

He was the charioteer for the supreme warrior Arjun during the Mahabharat. Arjuna didn&#39;t want to fight the war and Lord Krishna had a long conversation with him about life which is known as the Gita, the supreme Scripture for many Hindus.

I shall fast today and spend time with my family, read some theology thanks to Gita Press Gorakhpur.

The very first thing this commentary on the Gita says  is that one must appreciate being born a human. We can experience, conceive and feel divinity, something no other being can do and no matter how bad things are, we will always be lucky as compared to most animals.

This isn&#39;t the same as me going out for talking to girls or consuming substances but I like this a lot. I find theology quite profound and enjoyable to read. I find it more than just fun and hence the motif to post about today here.

May Lord Krishna bless us all. Happy Janmashtami to everyone reading this.

Jai Shri Krishna.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/ws5dhg/friday_fun_thread_for_august_19_2022/ikwl5po/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
