I read the article to contextualize US govt [statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/) from Aug 25, announcing that immediate open access to all taxpayer-funded research articles should be implemented by 2025, thus eliminating current 12 months embargo.

I wanted to ask here first, as my interest is in market power dynamics and bargaining, not consumer perspective. I’d love to know what you think about how it works.

And separately, I’d like to know what is so awful about the post, that no one responded? Is it too long, boring, cluttered, grammar is poor? Want to know how to improve engagement.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x5fpqj/smallscale_question_sunday_for_september_04_2022/in2y0fb/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
