Here is a timeline of his involvement with the Epstein case:

- Reinhart was working for the justice department
- 10/07 Reinhart registers a llc registered in Epstein’s defense lawyers name(not sure if it was registered like this from the beginning or switched later)
- during the middle of the case Reinhart switches sides, quits the DOJ and immediately starts represents Epstein’s employees. The llc is used for his defense firm
- 2011 Reinhart denies he was involved in the case while at the DOJ during a lawsuit 
- 2013 supervisors of reinhart contradict him and say he was privy to private info about the case.

Am I missing something here, because it seems like he was in contact about a job with Epstein’s side while the DOJ was prosecuting Epstein and he was privy to private info about the case. Seems like straightforward corruption</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijp0dfw/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
