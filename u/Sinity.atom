I remembered [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vlopk0/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_june_27_2022/idwelna/) by /u/ZorbaTHut about trying to generalize the problem of (supposedly existing) people who can&#39;t understand conditionals. And I wonder if there&#39;s any connection with inability to understand pointers and recursion by some people described [here](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/). Indirection?

&amp;gt; I’ve come to realize that **understanding pointers in C is not a skill, it’s an aptitude**. In first year computer science classes, there are always about 200 kids at the beginning of the semester, all of whom wrote complex adventure games in BASIC for their PCs when they were 4 years old. They are having a good ol’ time learning C or Pascal in college, until one day the professor introduces pointers, and suddenly, they don’t get it.

&amp;gt; They just don’t understand anything any more. 90% of the class goes off and becomes Political Science majors, then they tell their friends that there weren’t enough good looking members of the appropriate sex in their CompSci classes, that’s why they switched. **For some reason most people seem to be born without the part of the brain that understands pointers. Pointers require a complex form of doubly-indirected thinking that some people just can’t do**, and it’s pretty crucial to good programming. A lot of the “script jocks” who started programming by copying JavaScript snippets into their web pages and went on to learn Perl never learned about pointers, and they can never quite produce code of the quality you need.

&amp;gt; That’s the source of all these famous interview questions you hear about, like “reversing a linked list” or “detect loops in a tree structure.”


Through now that I checked, recursion was already covered in that 4chan post Scott referenced

&amp;gt; Other interesting phenomenon around IQ involves recursion. For example: &#34;Write a story with two named characters, each of whom have at least one line of dialogue.&#34; Most literate people can manage this, especially once you give them an example. &#34;Write a story with two named characters, each of whom have at least one line of dialogue. In this story, one of the characters must be describing a story with at least two named characters, each of whom have at least one line of dialogue.&#34; If you have less than 90 IQ, this second exercise is basically completely impossible. Add a third level (&#39;frame&#39;) to the story, and even IQ 100&#39;s start to get mixed up with the names and who&#39;s talking. Turns out Scheherazade was an IQ test!
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Time is practically impossible to understand for sub 80s. They exist only in the present, can barely reflect on the past and can&#39;t plan for the future at all. Sub 90s struggle with anachronism too. For example, I remember the 80-85s stumbling on logic problems that involved common sense anachronism stuff. For instance: &#34;Why do you think that military strategists in WWII didn&#39;t use laptop computers to help develop their strategies?&#34; &#34;I guess they didn&#39;t want to get hacked by Nazis&#34;. Admittedly you could argue that this is a history knowledge question, not quite a logic sequencing question, but you get the idea. Sequencing is super hard for them to track, but most 100+ have no problem with it, although I imagine that a movie like Memento strains them a little. Recursion was definitely the killer though. Recursive thinking and recursive knowledge seems genuinely hard for people of even average intelligence.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/ignl1wi/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
