Multiple (three or four) times we were asked if we had a reservation which we didn&#39;t (we were winging the whole trip). The host would then get in a huff, say they needed to check if they could squeeze us in, then reluctantly seat us. We&#39;d have our dinner and the restaurant never got above 50% full. Only time I get that in the US is when I walked in to an obviously slammed place or 30 min. before the rush and it&#39;s obvious it&#39;s going to fill up. Is this an actual thing or did I just get some selection bias?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijbgebk/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
