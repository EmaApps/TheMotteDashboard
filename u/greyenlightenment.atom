He also kept his daily calorie intake up by drinking   shakes, yet he still lost 3/lbs a week even though his calorie intake was presumably the same.  Some for people with esophagus cancer who go to a liquid diet; they lose so much weight despite consuming unlimited liquid calories. I wonder if liquid diets violate the age-old calorie-in-calorie out maxim.  Of course, some of this weight loss is due   to the cancer itself, but I wonder how much the liquid diet plays a role in this too.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x3t1mp/friday_fun_thread_for_september_02_2022/imywh47/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
