I&#39;ll just link to the twitter feed:

There&#39;s even some footage of after the stabbing, showing him being evacuated via helicopter. Pretty gruesome  stuff.  

My question is, where was the security. There is a fatwa on this guy... people associated with the book have been killed (notably a Japanese  translator). There should  have been metal detectors or something, yet the assailant was able to smuggle a knife into the venue and ambush him on stage.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ik0t07v/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
