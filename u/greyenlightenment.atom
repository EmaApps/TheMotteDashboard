I think finally we may be seeing our fist notable, multinational woke undoing. It&#39;s too early to blame wokness for sure, but Disney stock has been doing horribly lately, way worse than the S&amp;amp;P 500. 

Disney is at $95, a 53% decline from its peak just 16 months ago, versus a 20% decline for the S&amp;amp;P 500. Moreover, Disney stock is unchanged since early 2015, lagging the S&amp;amp;P 500 considerably there too. 

This difference is huge:  over the past 5 years the S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 56% (excluding dividends) but Disney is down 11%

Too early to celebrate but this could be a sign of things to come. Same for Netflix, which has also done horribly. I think however Google and Facebook will prove more impervious.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igq5z71/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igpi2uj/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[CW] Link from my blog [The stakes are low for US politics, and America’s rivals are </title><updated>2022-07-18T23:26:55Z</updated><author><name>greyenlightenment</name></author><category label="CW" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/cw" term="Culture War"/><content type="text">Link from my blog [The stakes are low for US politics, and America’s rivals are weak and apathetic](https://greyenlightenment.com/2022/07/18/the-stakes-are-low-for-us-politics-and-its-rivals-are-weak-or-apathetic/)

In this post I argue that America&#39;s political problems and division, in spite of social media outrage, are low stakes historically speaking. America&#39;s biggest rivals, China and Russia, are also quite weak too even compared to the Cold War.

&amp;gt;Or like the second half of the 20th century, which witnessed several assassinations of statesmen and other important people, including John and Robert Kennedy, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr., and also the attempted assassinations of Pope John Paul II and Ronald Reagan, in addition to the civil rights movement, the South flipping from Blue to Red, and endless crime waves and race riots that continued until the mid 90s, when crime finally began to fall. Regarding Roe v. Wade, unlike the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, there has been close to zero civil disobedience regarding abortion rights. The BLM riots of 2020, as bad as those were, had far far fewer deaths and injuries compared to the Rodney King riots. Jan 6th is not like 911, as much as the left wishes it was. Yeah, there is a lot of societal decay, such as homelessness and drug use, but this is not destabilizing, nor will it lead to unrest. Elites will continue to retreat from everyone else and the decay, forming their own enclaves and close-knit communities.

I think Pinker&#39;s  [Long Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Peace) thesis is still intact even though things may seem worse, thanks to social media , which has the effect of amplifying bad news, so it&#39;s hard to look at things in the correct context.  Thanks to social media, every small or isolated event of unrest is broadcast worldwide to billions of people in real time, whereas 40+ years ago similar events would have gone ignored or only mentioned in passing in a local newspaper.  Russia&#39;s war with Ukraine does not threaten this post-ww2 geopolitical &#39;order&#39;. Compared to the conflicts of Vietnam, WW2, or even the Yugoslav Wars, the Russian-Ukraine war doesn&#39;t  even measure up to a single battle of WW2, let alone the entire thing.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igpi2uj/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
