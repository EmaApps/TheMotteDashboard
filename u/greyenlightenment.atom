He also kept his daily calorie intake up by drinking   shakes, yet he still lost 3/lbs a week even though his calorie intake was presumably the same.  Some for people with esophagus cancer who go to a liquid diet; they lose so much weight despite consuming unlimited liquid calories. I wonder if liquid diets violate the age-old calorie-in-calorie out maxim.  Of course, some of this weight loss is due   to the cancer itself, but I wonder how much the liquid diet plays a role in this too.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x3t1mp/friday_fun_thread_for_september_02_2022/imywh47/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/imau220/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[SQ] Why is it so hard to invent a good sugar substitute?

All the economic incentives are  in place, you got many companies that stand to make probably  hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet a century later, despite collective billions of R&amp;amp;D and some of the smartest chemists,   nothing even comes close. We&#39;re talking imitating sugar, not trying to cure cancer. The policy implications of this are huge: helping to fix global obesity, for example. Yet why can&#39;t it be done?

Trying to lose weight and this would be a godsend.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/imau220/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
