Apparently rich people are using private planes for short flights, and it&#39;s an ecological disaster.

This story has been making the rounds for the past 4 days. It started as an article on Mel and then blew up and has been trending on twitter and all over the web. 

I am somewhat skeptical of the narrative that&#39;s it&#39;s that bad for the environment. Yes, it may be wasteful, but the number of people who fly private for short distances is minuscule compared to other sources of emissions and compared to commercial travel. So the environment impact is probably not that great even if private planes produce more CO2 compared to commercial on a per-seat basis.

&amp;gt;Overall, aviation doesn’t emit as much carbon as you may think. According to Air Transport Action Group (ATAG), the global aviation industry produces just 2% of human-induced CO2 emissions.

&amp;gt;But what about private jets? Well, a green travel report by VistaJet shows that private aviation makes up only 2% of the global aviation industry’s CO2 emissions. That means private aviation contributes less than 1%⁠—0.04% to be exact⁠—of the total global CO2 emissions.

I think also some of this impact is offset by increased efficiency of private planes. Although they consume more fuel  on a per passenger basis on takeoff, they are faster and fly at higher altitudes, so the trip is shorter. Also, they spend less time idling on runway or circling to land, unlike commercial planes.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/iheyxbt/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
