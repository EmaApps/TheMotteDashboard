NYTs link https://archive.ph/xnYdN#selection-377.0-380.0 &#34;Biden to Cancel $10,000 in Student Loan Debt for Borrowers Earning Less Than $125,000&#34;

&amp;gt;At least 9 million borrowers could have their balances entirely cleared by Biden’s plan, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

&amp;gt;Biden’s decision to move ahead with $10,000 in student debt cancellation for borrowers who earn under $125,000 will cost the federal government around $244 billion, Kantrowitz estimated. The $20,000 in relief for Pell Grant recipients may add around another $120 billion to the government’s costs.

&amp;gt;The unprecedented action by the White House of wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer debt follows years of advocacy pressure and recent months of heated debate among Biden administration officials.

From what I have read, such figures are slightly misleading. This seems like a lot, but it&#39;s much less because it&#39;s not like the government was ever going to collect on all of that $300+ billion. It&#39;s not like owing $1+ trillion to a creditor, the service has already been rendered. This is also why Democrats seem to have more success at  a policy-wide level compared to Republicans. Biden has delivered more for his voters than Trump did.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/ilme8dx/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
