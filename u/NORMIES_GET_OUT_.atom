It&#39;s quite isolating as well as disorienting- I&#39;m exhausted but not sleepy, starving but not hungry.

 I can&#39;t imagine doing this for months at a time and trying to maintain any family or social relationships, props to anyone in this thread who does it.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wqhcx8/wellness_wednesday_for_august_17_2022/ikmstw7/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
