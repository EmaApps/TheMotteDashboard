As you can guess by the demographics of this sub, preferably fantasy/scifi or nonfiction history.

If anyone else is looking for something, I&#39;ve really enjoyed the bobbiverse series (4th book is out, if anyone read/heard the first 3 and liked them), it&#39;s exactly at the perfect line of engaging enough to stay interesting but also not too complicated and not too action-laden so that I love to hear it in the evening/night to calm down. Basic premise is that the main character is an AI replicant of a human that existed at some point, trying to cope with his new existence as a von Neumann probe. He ultimately builds up an interstellar empire, the bobbiverse, entirely consisting of clones of himself. It&#39;s not super deep but handles many different topics, most of them reasonably well, without devolving into an author tract. For the most part refreshingly positive in attitude, which is unusual in scifi in my experience.

The First Law Trilogy, which I think was recommended here before, is okay. It&#39;s reasonably recent but is heavily reminiscent of 90s dark gritty fantasy, in both bad and good ways. A bit slow start though, and I saw the ending coming from a mile, both of which diminished my fun significantly. But the author does avoid all the most common pitfalls, like getting too overly grimdark , obvious self inserts/mary sue etc. .

&#34;The Murderbot Diaries&#34; is something I&#39;ve recently heard as well, but can&#39;t really recommend. Also with a sentient AI as the MC, it starts out as a decent if a bit repetitious contender in the &#34;dark gritty scifi comedy&#34;, but after some time the politics of the author become increasingly clear and it devolves into extremely simple black (corporations) vs white (nonbinary environmentally friendly slavery abolishing scientist communist utopia). If you like the premise, read/hear the first few stories, but don&#39;t expect it to hold up long.

All three however have decent speakers and are enjoyable to listen to.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/ilb4fkt/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
