I&#39;m still kind of doing some work, but mostly just keeping up with absolutely critical stuff, and taking it easy otherwise.

When I was a kid and would get to stay home sick from school, I&#39;d always play video games. My mom wouldn&#39;t let me stay home unless I was actually pretty sick, but if I did, then I&#39;d usually get to play for a while. Now I have this association with being sick and playing video games.

So I&#39;m finding myself at home, sick, trying to find a game to play. But, I can&#39;t really even manufacture an interest for games anymore. Even after looking through a bunch of reviews, reddit threads, etc. I want to want to play something, but I can&#39;t conjure it at all.

Idk, has anyone else noticed a similar decline in interest in gaming over the years? I never thought I&#39;d get old and stop playing games. But, here we are, and I&#39;m only 30. Nowadays I mostly just want to read a book, browse Hacker News, or work on some side programming projects.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wwbr8k/wellness_wednesday_for_august_24_2022/ilme9gr/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
