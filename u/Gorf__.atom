I liked it even more than the first one. Any book recommendations for when I finish the series? I like the characters, the near-future-ish tech, and the gritty and lighthearted space opera style. I liked the second book’s political narrative too. The horror stuff is just background to me, I could take it or leave it. 

I also love _Dune_. Otherwise I’m pretty new to the sci-fi genre.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijbc7lo/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
