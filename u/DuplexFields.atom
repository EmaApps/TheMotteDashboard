It’s a suboptimal strategy when the previous solution has doubles of a given letter (or two), but it gives me a sense of continuity and challenge, and beats starting with “SLATE” or “ARIEL” every day.

What are your favorite Wordle tools?

My primary tool is Notepad, wherein I use the notation of capital letters for certainties, lowercase for possibilities and dashes for impossibilities. Let’s say the word is “&amp;gt;!NIGHT!&amp;lt;” and I’ve guessed “GRAIN”, “SPROG”, and “THERE”, getting no greens, some yellows, and all five letters by the third guess. If I didn’t immediately think of &#34;&amp;gt;!NIGHT!&amp;lt;&#34;, I’d type these in like so:

    G: -ggg-
    I: iii-i
    N: nnnn-
    T: -tttt
    H: h-hhh

I also have an Excel spreadsheet with every word in Wordle’s “guess” dictionary and none from the “solutions” dictionary, so I’ll never accidentally see the real answer. The five letters are each in their own columns, in a filterable List, so in the above example I can eliminate RASPO from all columns after the second guess and E after the third. If I’m still stumped, I can eliminate G from the first and last column, I from the fourth, and so on, and see what’s left to make another guess to eliminate up to five more letters. Of course, in this example I’ve got all five letters by my third guess, so I could just turn off all but those letters, and maybe turn some back on, to eliminate additional positions.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wmcsjf/friday_fun_thread_for_august_12_2022/ik3a798/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
