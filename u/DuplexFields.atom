Before installing iTunes on my HP laptop with Core i5 7th Gen Intel, I could watch fullscreen video without judder, I could have dozens of tabs open simultaneously, I could play video games.

Then I installed iTunes for a work project. Fullscreen video runs at one frame per second, and embedded videos almost as slowly. Even two tabs on Firefox makes it nearly impossible to move my mouse cursor, which moves, freezes, and then reappears halfway across screen.

Now, even after uninstalling iTunes (and its associated tools) and a day later reinstalling my Intel onboard graphics driver, the problems remain. Since I can&#39;t afford a new computer, I&#39;m stuck with this one for now, and I&#39;ll need to use it next weekend to run an RPG, so the clock is ticking. Any suggestions?

EDIT: SOLVED. No more replies plz. Thanks for all the help! Apparently it&#39;s a known problem with Win10, usually drivers, and it&#39;s been solved by people doing things as wacky as disabling their DVD drive or uninstalling their mouse.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w6otlm/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_24_2022/ihgexto/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
