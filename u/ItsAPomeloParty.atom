I mean I know the answer is don&#39;t drink, but suppose the deed is done.

Drank for the first time in months recently. Hangover was bearable, about what you&#39;d expect from one. But the real drag was for a while afterward every single day was diarrhea. Intestines are not a fan of the whole drinking thing. For that and other reasons I do not plan on doing this very often at all--but any helpful tips to keep in mind would be appreciated.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/weyt58/wellness_wednesday_for_august_03_2022/iix1zxm/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii6wb1t/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Anybody got any genius miracle cures for &#34;brain fog&#34;?

I can&#39;t explain why but it feels like screen time might be the culprit so might try to limit that since it is the weekend</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii6wb1t/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
