It lapsed today and I am drunk and so so happy. I have made another promise and am ok with this being something I experience only a few times a year (since chasing that dragon clearly leads only to horrible things).

Just wanna say hi to y&#39;all. Love to everybody.

I wish this were something sustainable. But it is what it is. God has made it so. Chemical happiness is temporary and poisonous and it has to be.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/iil2u16/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii6wb1t/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] Anybody got any genius miracle cures for &#34;brain fog&#34;?

I can&#39;t explain why but it feels like screen time might be the culprit so might try to limit that since it is the weekend</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/waw03g/friday_fun_thread_for_july_29_2022/ii6wb1t/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
