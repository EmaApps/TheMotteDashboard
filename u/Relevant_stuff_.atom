I&#39;m from south america and I&#39;ve been taking Concerta as part of a treatment from my doctor because of ADHD (with so far good results). 

Now I&#39;m traveling in Europe for already two months and run out of medication a month ago. I know methylphenidate is more difficult to get and to avoid getting tested again by a doctor (I&#39;m not staying that much time in a given country) I&#39;m willing to try Modafinil as some say it has positive results. Any ideas?
