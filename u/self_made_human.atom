I&#39;ve always wanted to flee from India for fairer shores, and while the NHS might be slowly imploding, it&#39;s *still* miles ahead of what I have to deal with here.

I&#39;ve been preparing for the British medical licensing exam there for almost a year, which is probably the longest I&#39;ve ever been able to focus on a task, although the bulk of the focused prep was in the past 3 months. And for once, I don&#39;t have that typical ADHD anxiety the night before the test, because I genuinely know I&#39;ve done all I can, I score well above the cutoff in practise tests, and unlike pretty much every exam I&#39;ve ever given, I don&#39;t find myself desperately cramming the night before to make up for not bothering before.

Maybe it&#39;s that this is something that I *want*, as opposed to entering medicine or making it through med school, a decision prompted more by the fact that there wasn&#39;t any other profession I preferred, rather than a genuine passion for it. I mostly phoned it in then, but faced with the prospect of finally striking out on my own, and making something of myself in foreign shores, I actually did things right for once.

In fact, I have more anxiety about my *lack* of anxiety than anything else, to know that I&#39;m probably going to make it through regardless of reckless scrambles is a novel feeling for me.

Wish me luck, while this isn&#39;t the end of the journey by any means, it&#39;s the first milestone along the way, and I genuinely hope I make it through. The grass may or may not be greener on the other side, but I&#39;m determined to find out for myself..</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijrj3bk/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
