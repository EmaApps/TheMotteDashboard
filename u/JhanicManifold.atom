The lack of norms surrounding steelmanning, the intellectual turing test and not holding your position too emotionally just made the whole thing unbelievably frustrating. The guy was pathologically unable to understand that his ideological opponents didn&#39;t have evil motives, but that they were normal, well-meaning people just like him. 

In finding the last few islands of good reasoning remaining on the internet, I might have forgotten how people (even smart ones) debate in the wild. I think no left-leaning person is ever really exposed to coherent right-wing arguments, and even when couched in a &#34;I&#39;m just playing devil&#39;s advocate&#34; frame, it still elicits frustration and anger in them. Lesson learned: don&#39;t ever debate anything political or religious unless you have reason to think that the person is one of the vanishingly few who can do that without frustration.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/weyt58/wellness_wednesday_for_august_03_2022/iivbqf8/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
