I&#39;m trying to read more real books and history is always fun. I&#39;m open to any really good books, but I&#39;d specifically like

* Rome (Been rewatching Rome on HBO Max)
* Indian history, esp Partition. Thats a big blank spot on my history knowledge
* Economic history is fun. I always enjoy hearing about the behind the scenes factors that led to our modern world.

I usually prefer larger scope to smaller, though there have been notable exceptions. Not usually into biographies but willing to give them a shot.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ieoyoma/"/></entry></feed>
