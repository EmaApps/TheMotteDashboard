She&#39;s clearly coming from a woke perspective — &#34;I only date people on the left; I guess that makes me &#39;rightphobic&#39;, but I&#39;m okay with that,&#34; lol. But she&#39;s also far more nuanced than your typical Twitter SJW (is there a less-dated noun for That Type? anyway)

Some notable excerpts, emphasis added by me:

&amp;gt; **A society that rejects transgender people’s bodies as valid is also one that deeply fetishizes them.** As a trans woman, most of the men I’d describe as “chasers” are men who get off on the social taboo of sleeping with transgender women and the fact that no one knows what they’re doing. Partially because they’re ashamed, but also because the secret excites them. Their secrecy also maintains their chances with cis women, who tend to be their preference. These men know that a lot of cis women would be repulsed if they knew they were attracted to transgender women, and this is the excuse they give for treating trans women how they do. Unfortunately, most chasers are in the position they’re in because they saw a trans woman who challenged their understanding of self, and they slowly but surely developed the habit of secretly consuming transgender pornography and contacting transgender women. They were curious, but then they learned they can prey on a group of people who are so used to not being preferred that they are often willing to go the extra mile to satisfy those who have privilege over them. **In fact, because transgender women know that they are rarely preferred over cis women, the attention of cis men is very validating to transgender women who are in an insecure phase of life. It’s not uncommon for transgender women to feel flattered by the affection of a man who identifies as heterosexual because, to them the expression of attraction is also a validation of them as women.** So, you have a group of heterosexual men who might otherwise be unimpressive whose inherent quality is now seen as impressive long before anything else is established. Some men become intoxicated by the idea that all they have to do is say they’re straight and gorgeous transgender women, who haven’t quite found their worth, will overlook all of their flaws, all of the reasons other women have rejected them all to feel more proximity to their privilege. This often leads to some very toxic and abusive dynamics that are very stressful for transgender women. **These men are actively attracted to them and choose to mistreat them because they are transgender. For me, that will always feel more transphobic than someone simply saying no to me.**

---

&amp;gt; Who men tend to prefer becomes very obvious when you are polyamorous. **I’ve dated men of various racial backgrounds who all denied they had a preference but were often primary partnered to cis white women. If they weren’t when I met them, almost all of them left or paused their relationships with me because of a new, cis white partner.** Removing monogamy from the conversation, allows for these things to be seen more clearly because a monogamous person could easily argue that it’s a coincidence that they just so happened to fall in love with someone who fits the idealized beauty standard. When you live in a very diverse city and all of your partners are that idealized beauty standard, it’s obvious you have a preference; but these people will deny it. **If you went to a Polyamory social and lined up every woman who was primary partnered, most of them will be cis and white; that’s not a coincidence. You’ll notice the “secondary” partners tend to be a bit darker skinned, often more queer, sometimes less cis than their primary. Often times, men primary their “preference” and keep their curiosities or the less socially acceptable partners as secondaries. To this day, I have never met a cis man primary partnered to a transgender woman with a cis woman as a secondary, but I have been the transgender secondary partner for many polyamorous men in LA.** If you were to ask these men if they had a preference, they would absolutely say no, but you see their preferences clear as day and you notice how when new women of color come to the event, they don’t get swarmed with attention the same way a white girl would. None of these socially aware, left leaning people want to say that they have a preference, but they do. But being a bit graceful, another aspect of “preference” that isn’t often discussed is that sometimes their “preference” really isn’t even their own. 

There are a couple poly people here, right? Hoping you can comment on whether her perception matches yours as well. Not because I don&#39;t believe her — sounds very plausible — but because scene dynamics can vary, regionally and otherwise, so I&#39;m curious.

Overall, the territory she treads in this essay is familiar — it&#39;s the madonna-whore dichotomy, the difference between a good-time girl and the one you take home to mama. I can imagine it&#39;s very frustrating to be sorted into the &#34;whore&#34; category sheerly because of your demographic. Last excerpt:

&amp;gt; Maybe it’s because I date men, but my experience with being less preferred has often been that I’m placed in a position where my intimate partners mistreat me and expect me to stay because they know I’m less preferred. It took me a while to understand that white men like my ex who very performatively trash white women to uplift women of color are doing so out of bitterness and a history of rejection. A lot of times when these men have low self-esteem, they’ll pursue someone they know they have more privilege than to prey on theirs instead. **Through our relationship, I knew he had insecurities, but I didn’t make the connection that those insecurities meant that he was intimidated by the white women he preferred and that he saw me as easier to connect with because I existed outside of most people’s preferences.** When he spoke about white women, it was always about how they were too prissy or high maintenance. He’d complain about women who had standards and were willing to say no and not settle for less. In retrospect, I can see that he knew he’d get away with relying on me financially because perhaps subconsciously, I did buy into the idea that a relationship with him was flattering, and I didn’t want to walk away from it. Chasers will often trash cis women in a similar way. They’ll talk about how much more feminine trans women are and how bitchy and stuck up cis women are. It’s all constructed to prey on the insecurities they know society promotes within you. These are often relationships where I’m expected to do a lot and to put up with more shit than the women they prefer. I cannot even believe that I spent all of this money in my last relationship providing for a man who is far more privileged than I’ll ever be, but that’s often the position you end up in. **These men often expect you to do more labor for them because you do not have the same bargaining power as their preference. I’ve seen men who were broke for me, be rich for their preference.** These relationships always left me feeling depleted and the only reason I speak so much about them is that they’ve left me with lasting trauma that has very viciously affected me and made me so fearful of men and their true desires. For that reason, it’s hard for me to hear conversations that attribute bigotry to someone rejecting someone they do not prefer. **I struggle to buy into the idea that because a man is attracted to me, he’s less bigoted than the men who reject me on the basis of who I am and leave me alone. I wish so many of my former intimate partners simply left me alone and pursued their preferences until one stuck. I wish they’d stop using me as a stop gap between relationships with the kind of women they prefer.** I wish I could stop being in relationships where I’m expected to settle for less, because of who I am. I cannot remember every man who’s rejected me for being a trans woman, but to this day, I feel the pain of being so intimate with men who mistreated me because I’m a transgender woman.

I definitely sympathize with the issue of having your low self-esteem used as manipulation leverage within an intimate relationship, by someone who is doing that shit because they too have low self-esteem (whether the self-assessment, by either party, is warranted or not).

Another theme of the essay, not emphasized as much in the longer passages that I quoted, is the degree to which desire is culturally mediated. She writes, &#34;What I dislike about this discourse is that on one hand it acknowledges that the type of people we&#39;re attracted to is linked to our socialization, but it downplays the depth of that socialization.&#34;

As for myself, I don&#39;t really have a point here. I thought her perspective — her inside view of dating as a black trans woman — was very interesting. I def encourage you to read the [whole post](https://blaqueinthecity.com/2022/05/21/dating-preferences-and-the-painful-burden-of-being-less-preferred-but-always-desired-2/).
