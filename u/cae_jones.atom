The trouble is, I kinda feel like I&#39;ve hit a wall. In particular, I&#39;ve been working on a game, under the assumption I&#39;m not going to bother releasing it, which puts me in a weird position where I&#39;m done with all the bits I need to enjoy it, but it&#39;s not really complete-complete. I managed to get sufficiently into the habit of working on it at certain times that not working on it is unpleasant, but I&#39;m having trouble getting myself to either work on the unnecessary-for-me-but-should-probably-do-anyway bits, or starting something different, and so I feel at risk of backsliding into the abyss.

I think maybe I&#39;m not working hard enough at exercise or meditation as habits. I&#39;m not sure why. They clearly help when I do. ???</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vsj44o/wellness_wednesday_for_july_06_2022/ifkz35p/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
