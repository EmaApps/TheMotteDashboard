Here it is again: Conservatives fucking LOVE trans porn, and liberals don&#39;t seem to know it exists. 

Likewise, conservative as a population love cuckoldry(BLACK), cheating, and Teen; while liberals seem to go in hard for BDSM, rape play, and power dynamic shit.

You can&#39;t really do anything useful with this other than score the meaningless dunks on the more na√Øve type of lib or con; but I always wonder if there is anything meaningful you can take from it?

That is, I don&#39;t really have anything interesting to say about it that hasn&#39;t been said, other than I still don&#39;t understand the why this would be the case to consistently and none of the explanations I&#39;ve heard have an air of truthiness.

Anyone have any links that they feel explain this well?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ihllphv/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
