Cloudflare had previously terminated services to The Daily Stormer and 8chan, but this time the company says it will take no action, and even suggest the previous deplatformings were a mistake.

Selected quotes:

&amp;gt;Some argue that we should terminate these services to content we find reprehensible so that others can launch attacks to knock it offline. That is the equivalent argument in the physical world that the fire department shouldn&#39;t respond to fires in the homes of people who do not possess sufficient moral character. Both in the physical world and online, that is a dangerous precedent, and one that is over the long term most likely to disproportionately harm vulnerable and marginalized communities.

&amp;gt;[...]

&amp;gt;Just as the telephone company doesn&#39;t terminate your line if you say awful, racist, bigoted things, we have concluded in consultation with politicians, policy makers, and experts that turning off security services because we think what you publish is despicable is the wrong policy. To be clear, just because we did it in a limited set of cases before doesn’t mean we were right when we did. Or that we will ever do it again.

&amp;gt;[...]

&amp;gt;We do, however, believe that in cases where our values are diametrically opposed to a paying customer that we should take further steps to not only not profit from the customer, but to use any proceeds to further our companies’ values and oppose theirs.

&amp;gt;For instance, when a site that opposed LGBTQ+ rights signed up for a paid version of DDoS mitigation service we worked with our Proudflare employee resource group to identify an organization that supported LGBTQ+ rights and donate 100 percent of the fees for our services to them. We don&#39;t and won&#39;t talk about these efforts publicly because we don&#39;t do them for marketing purposes; we do them because they are aligned with what we believe is morally correct.
