I&#39;d like to know if this is a common experience.

Over the past few years, I&#39;ve actively exposed myself on a regular basis to the writings of critical social justice-leaning people (which is quite a bit when you consider that it&#39;s added on top of the basic amount of wokeness that everyone is routinely exposed to through the media, entertainment, and even their own social groups). Something that&#39;s necessary if you want to participate in culture war matters is understanding the phenomenon you&#39;re critiquing, but properly understanding the perspective and worldview of your opponents has a few long-term consequences.

What&#39;s maddening about reading and just generally being exposed to a huge array of (fairly absurd) woke perspectives isn&#39;t the initial annoyance that it inevitably causes. I do have strong reasons for opposition to their ideas, but if you are exposed to them too much, regardless of how weak you think the arguments are your brain nevertheless starts to incessantly detail how they would interpret and respond to things you see around you. For example, at this point, I&#39;m now able to involuntarily construct - say - a feminist argument in the back of my mind on a daily basis without even intending to do so, and then feel the strong urge to refute what I myself came up with. It&#39;s a very common thing that I can simply just think myself angry.

Perhaps I&#39;m uniquely obsessive, but I find it hard to believe that I&#39;m the only person who experiences this.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v053ii/smallscale_question_sunday_for_may_29_2022/iakgnu7/"/></entry></feed>
