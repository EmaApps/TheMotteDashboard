My (previous) company dropped about 30% of its workforce.

All in all, it isn&#39;t so bad. They paid good severance and it looks like the labor market is still pretty strong in my area (software engineering). I will also likely get a significant pay bump in my next position.

And yet the entire process has just kinda left my feeling crummy. I (obviously) knew that this sort of thing can happen but the immediate impact of my career and (short term) livelihood being in the hands of someone I don&#39;t know -- where I am just basically a row on a spreadsheet that they&#39;re washing their hands of -- does not feel good. I also really liked the people I worked with (and this seems really hard to screen for ahead of time IMO, more of a crapshoot) and we worked remotely throughout the country, so will likely not really every see one another again. 

My life is pretty hectic at home with a young child at the moment but I definitely want to start thinking about diversifying my income stream outside of just one job.

Not sure the point of this post, just venting I guess.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih6qjeu/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
