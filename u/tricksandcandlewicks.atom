The EU wants Lithuania to back down. It would seem that predictions that Russia saw this move as a serious threat to its sovereignty over Kalingrad were correct. I was more surprised that the EU decided to fold that quickly. When they&#39;re already getting Russia to shut down Nord Stream 2 and other pipelines, it makes me wonder what cards are left to play.

While I do find the Ukranian case for war sympathetic, I really don&#39;t get the case for Lithuania poking the bear here. This isn&#39;t even a case of Lithuania building up a military capable of enforcing the regulations it was trying to pass, just taking an opportunity to swipe at the much bigger country next door for unclear reasons.
