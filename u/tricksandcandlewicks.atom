In summary, the evidence seems to be that one of his staffers did not properly disclose that she was at one point a foreign national for the country of Georgia, and he was aware of this and did not submit the proper form according to the current byzantine federal regulations on hand. In the substack article that was attempting to make them look as guilty as possible, I had to question just how serious they were trying to portray a crime that seemed to be the most banal of clerical errors.

That it was purely devoid of anything serious made me think it would be a nothingburger. At best, they would just fire or arrest the staffer, as there&#39;s almost nothing to charge DeSantis with. But some people seemed to think it was a real move to try and charge DeSantis with something so that the most aggrieved democrats could have something to say they have done, with the Jan 6 hearings currently going nowhere fast. I&#39;m going to follow this to see if my priors were correct, but I would be interested in hearing a steelman of whether there is anything seriously legally wrong here that a prosecutor could pounce on, both for DeSantis and for Trump over Jan 6.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ii6eqhf/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
