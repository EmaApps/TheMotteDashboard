This is after Cheney voted to impeach Trump in 2020, and then provided various choice quotes in the Jan 6 hearings against him. It seems the Republican voters are committed to enforcing party loyalty to Trump, and now Cheney will either have run to the Democrats or accept she no longer has a voice in the party.

This combined with the recent FBI probe on Trump&#39;s home, and the confirmation of the incident in &#39;the Beast&#39; make Trump seem only further like the best candidate for the GOP. The system is doing all it can to put him down, and is making life worse and worse for the average person. Trying to squeeze swing voters with a moderate candidate at this stage just looks like giving in to people with the worst of intentions.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/iko5pes/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
