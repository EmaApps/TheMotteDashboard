As ZorbaTHut [has posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/comment/ilj878k/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3), D-Day approaches. The move is a matter of when, not if. I don&#39;t think the exact date for pulling the switch has been set, but it&#39;s possible this will be the last ban report here. (Whether I&#39;ll continue doing these on the new site... eh. We&#39;ll see. Depends on how the mod tools work, how much modding there is to do, how active I am after the changeover, etc.)

Incidentally, there have been 3 AEO actions since the last report. One was someone talking about the dreaded triple parentheses and the admins failing to comprehend the use-mention distinction. One was someone using the newly-verboten g-word. And one was someone making a pretty bad comment about trans women which had already been modded before the admins came by and nuked it.
