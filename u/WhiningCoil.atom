At first I was curious about, and then enthralled by Hardspace: Shipbreaker.  It&#39;s a game where you tear down derelict spacecraft for scrap.  Feels like peeling a very intricate onion, with lots of hazards that will burn, freeze, electrocute, crush or explode you.  But generally if you are careful and thoughtful, none of those things happen.  Well, generally.  Sometimes there is no avoiding an explosive decompression.

I &#34;beat&#34; that right before Xenoblade Chronicles 3 came out.  I&#39;m actually really appreciating the pacing of this one way more than XC2.  I swear it was what, 10 hours into the game they were still explaining core mechanics to you?  Now don&#39;t get me wrong.  XC3 is still throwing a new mechanic at me every play session.  But it just feels a bit more evenly paced?

Anyways, I&#39;ll probably have more thoughts as I go through it, but if you liked XC2 it&#39;s a strong recommend.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wgmqqy/friday_fun_thread_for_august_05_2022/ij1nc57/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
