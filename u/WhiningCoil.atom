So minor spoilers for Stranger Things, on the character side.  Not the plot side.  They made Will unambiguously gay in season 4.  I hate it.  I hate everything about it.

I remember when Stranger Things came out, a lot of us 80&#39;s kids loved it.  It felt relatively authentic to our childhoods, especially being a nerd back then.  A group of us loved it so much, we got together for a retro AD&amp;amp;D 2E campaign.

The biking around everywhere.  The relatively undeveloped spread out suburban/rural town.  The total lack of adult supervision.  And of course, being a nerd super into something that utterly consumes your every waking thought.  And every moment spent at school is a moment you are patiently, or not so patiently, waiting to get back to that thing.

Probably the most authentic part of it, to me, was Will being a late bloomer.  Because myself and most of my nerd friends, damned near through highschool for most of them, weren&#39;t that interested in girls.  Even afraid of them to be honest.  And this often resulted in us getting picked on, beat up, and of course called gay.  Back when that was an acceptable insult to throw around at a public grade school.

Maybe one got a girlfriend.  But most had inclinations not dissimilar from the &#34;gay&#34; sentiments Will is constantly expressing, of just wanting to play D&amp;amp;D and Nintendo their whole life.  I can barely describe how much this character choice rubs me the wrong way.  In effect, it validates every bully we ever had who thought the way we were made us gay.

I donno, I hear there are some closeted gay 80&#39;s kids applauding it.  Good for them I guess?  Turns out culture truly is a zero sum game.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wulqxp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_22_2022/im4j12s/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilvmmbv/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] So I&#39;m still greatly enjoying Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but I had to take a week o</title><updated>2022-08-26T15:05:01Z</updated><author><name>WhiningCoil</name></author><category label="FF" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/ff" term="Friday Fun"/><content type="text">So I&#39;m still greatly enjoying Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but I had to take a week off to travel.

The job system hasn&#39;t really opened up as much as I&#39;d hoped.  I&#39;m like, 40 hours into the game, and all my jobs are still capped at level 10.  I can clearly see they go up to level 20, I just have no idea when/how I uncap them.  Will it be story related, or a sidequest?  I guess I&#39;ll find out.  But that obnoxious cap turns the job system from something fun, to a chore where I&#39;m constantly rejiggering my party&#39;s jobs because someone hit their cap, and I don&#39;t want XP to goto waste.  I can&#39;t fucking wait for the cap to go away.

The story is **very** Xenoblade.  If you&#39;ve played one, you know what I mean.

The geography and world design at first seemed very bog standard.  It&#39;s gotten much more creative and alien as I&#39;ve gone along.  It&#39;s funny though, because Xenoblade 1 and 2 both started off with monologs about &#34;This game takes place on the back of a giant titan(s)&#34;.  Xenoblade 3 just throws you in, with no explanation about the construction or orientation of the world.  I think it&#39;s still taking place on a titan?  Maybe the corpses of the titans from the first two games?  I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;ll be interesting if they just never fucking tell you, but I think I&#39;d like at least a few more hints.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilvmmbv/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
