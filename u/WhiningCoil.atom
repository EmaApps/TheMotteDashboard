The job system hasn&#39;t really opened up as much as I&#39;d hoped.  I&#39;m like, 40 hours into the game, and all my jobs are still capped at level 10.  I can clearly see they go up to level 20, I just have no idea when/how I uncap them.  Will it be story related, or a sidequest?  I guess I&#39;ll find out.  But that obnoxious cap turns the job system from something fun, to a chore where I&#39;m constantly rejiggering my party&#39;s jobs because someone hit their cap, and I don&#39;t want XP to goto waste.  I can&#39;t fucking wait for the cap to go away.

The story is **very** Xenoblade.  If you&#39;ve played one, you know what I mean.

The geography and world design at first seemed very bog standard.  It&#39;s gotten much more creative and alien as I&#39;ve gone along.  It&#39;s funny though, because Xenoblade 1 and 2 both started off with monologs about &#34;This game takes place on the back of a giant titan(s)&#34;.  Xenoblade 3 just throws you in, with no explanation about the construction or orientation of the world.  I think it&#39;s still taking place on a titan?  Maybe the corpses of the titans from the first two games?  I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;ll be interesting if they just never fucking tell you, but I think I&#39;d like at least a few more hints.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wy0c32/friday_fun_thread_for_august_26_2022/ilvmmbv/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
