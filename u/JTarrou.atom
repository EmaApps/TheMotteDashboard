&amp;gt;One figure, more than anything else, jumped out at me. Australia’s Indigenous population went up steeply to 813,000 people (3.2 per cent of the population).  
&amp;gt;  
&amp;gt;This increase of 25 per cent compared to 2016 data is huge. Obviously, this increase can’t, by definition, be driven by migration and wasn’t the result of an outrageously high birth rate either. Rather, more people self-identified as Indigenous on the census form.

This is a wonderful thing:

&amp;gt;We collectively created an environment where more people are confident enough to proclaim their heritage loudly and proudly.

But, of course, they run into the Warren Paradox.
