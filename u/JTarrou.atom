In which we see the bad faith, bad education and bad legislating process on display. The short historical sequence goes like this: 

1: After the Las Vegas shooting (in which the gunman owned but did not use a weapon with a bump stock), Trump directed the ATF to reclassify bump stocks as &#34;machine guns&#34;, a legal move which erases the distinction between semi- and full-automatic firearms. No longer is the dividing line &#34;one shot per pull of the trigger&#34;. Now the official position of the ATF is that a machine gun is any gun that can be fired quickly (undefined). [Jerry&#39;s](https://youtu.be/0FbUMqoyjDw?t=48) gonna need a tax stamp!

2: With bump stocks banned, but the legal fight only beginning and nobody turning them in, they turn to pistol braces, another legal-loophole device for a different law. In essence, these allow people who live in states that ban or heavily restrict SBRs (short-barreled rifles) to have a similar gun that is classified legally as a pistol. Sold as a device for disabled people, this is rarely how they are used, it&#39;s just a stock by another name, but legally distinct to keep from violating the NFA. 

3: So the anti-gun position has been to try to get the pistol braces banned not for being an end-run around the NFA, but for being a machine gun! This, despite the fact that there is zero way for a pistol brace to increase the rate of fire over a regular stock, if anything the opposite. 

For non-gun-people, it&#39;s a bit like if we banned sports cars for being too fast, then reclassified ten-speed bikes as sports cars, then banned bicycle shorts for being a turbo-charger.  So, the next time someone says the words &#34;common sense gun control&#34;, do me a favor and remember this bit. This is &#34;common sense&#34;.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih6gzap/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
