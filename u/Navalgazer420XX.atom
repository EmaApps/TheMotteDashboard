I&#39;m already getting half a billion dollars worth of [entertainment](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYS5d_YUEAAPl2D?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=orig) from it, and I&#39;m not even gonna watch.

Also my deeply closeted white trash middle school boyfriend turning out to be Sauron is an acceptable twist, if a lazy and obvious one.

The FDA recommends eating less than a teaspoon of salt per day, while animals our size generally eat a quarter to a third of an oz per day.  
I don&#39;t eat any processed food, so the only salt I get is on meat and fried eggs. Have been developing salt cravings this summer to the point that livestock mineral salt looks really delicious, which is a pretty reliable sign I&#39;m missing _something_.   
Everything out there is just yelling at people not to eat salt, but maybe someone here has done some proper research?

Bonus question: other than a costco multivitamin, what&#39;s a good extra source of zinc and other useful minerals?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w3f00s/wellness_wednesday_for_july_20_2022/ih1pz9v/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
