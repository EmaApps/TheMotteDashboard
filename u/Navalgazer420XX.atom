After playing a game that made fun of him, I read that Josef Fritzl, [World&#39;s Least Popular Austrian (silver medalist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritzl_case) might be eligible for probation next year, after 15 years in prison for the whole multi-generational incest rape dungeon business.  
It made me curious: what&#39;s the media environment in european countries like when this happens? Does the press pay any attention to it? Do people ever talk seriously about maybe bus-full-of-nuns-murderers needing to spend more time in prison?  

In the UK it&#39;s usually only the Daily Mail that notices/comes out with headlines about bringing back hanging, while the US sometimes gets some hand-wringing in the serious-people papers if the stars and skin colours align (which is fairly rare due to the 7 million year sentences in such cases).  
Is it basically the same in Europe? The only big one I&#39;m aware of was Pim Fortuyn&#39;s unrepentant assassin being released after 12(!) years to apparently more media attention in the english-speaking press than the dutch.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x5fpqj/smallscale_question_sunday_for_september_04_2022/in22r6p/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
