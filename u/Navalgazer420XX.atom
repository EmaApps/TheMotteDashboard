After playing a game that made fun of him, I read that Josef Fritzl, [World&#39;s Least Popular Austrian (silver medalist)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritzl_case) might be eligible for probation next year, after 15 years in prison for the whole multi-generation incest rape dungeon business.  
It made me curious: what&#39;s the media environment in european countries like when this happens? Does the press pay any attention to it at all? Do people ever talk seriously about maybe bus-full-of-nuns-murderers needing to spend more time in prison?  
In the UK it&#39;s usually only the Daily Mail that notices/comes out with headlines about bringing back hanging, while the US sometimes manages some hand-wringing from the serious people papers if the stars and skin colours align (which is fairly rare due to the 7 million year sentences in such cases). Is it basically the same in Europe?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/imvpnz4/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
