Found a nice band of gravel &amp;amp; sand at 18 ft in one conveniently close to where I need it. If it goes down a good 10 ft I&#39;m probably set.  
I have no experience with solar, and wondered if any of our trad homesteaders had any advice about a solar pump setup for irrigation (although it seems like a lot of those guys stopped posting or left for CWR/DSL?)

Am still working out how much water I really need for for the 3 rainless months, and whether a storage pond or ~1gpm shallow well feeding into a smaller tank uphill would be better.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijdo5fs/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
