[Betting markets](https://electionbettingodds.com/NextUKConservativeLeader2022.html) give Liz Truss a 47% chance of winning and Penny Mordaunt an 12% chance.

Dominic Cummings (rationalist, Brexit Mastermind, and former top adviser to Boris Johnson) [writes](https://dominiccummings.substack.com/p/snippets-6-the-leadership-race-sw1?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email):

&amp;gt; PennyM is a true idiot. She would be total fiasco as PM

&amp;gt; LizzT is a bit less stupid but much more crackers and would also be a total fiasco.

&amp;gt; Either of them would not just fail, they could destroy the party. Which means that many will be cheering for one of them.

&amp;gt; Boris is supporting Truss. Why? 1) He thinks it’s the best way to stop Sunak. 2) He knows Truss is mad as a box of snakes and is thinking, ‘there’s a chance she blows, there’s another contest and I can return’.

&amp;gt; And with the human handgrenade [LizzT], she may catastrophically escalate the war — remember she has defined the goal as pushing Russia out of Crimea, which if seriously attempted would be seen by the vast majority of Russians Iincluding anti-Putin Russians) as an attempt to destroy Russia and could lead to nuclear weapons.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/igsmj99/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
