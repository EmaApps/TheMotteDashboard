I&#39;ve had therapy while in college before and I&#39;m not interested in it again. The biggest benefit of therapy for me was from preparing to articulate about my thoughts and I do that now anyways in a journal. 

So now I wonder, what about psychotherapists? Where should my expectations be? Doing research on local ones, I&#39;m concerned their specialties don&#39;t apply to me (marital, anger, adhd, phobia, learning disability, etc). Should I organize all my self notes into a lengthy character study, to maximize our sessions? And so on.

To those who have had psychotherapy, which genres of contradiction did you have (or not have) success with resolving? General insights are also welcome.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wkpy9w/wellness_wednesday_for_august_10_2022/ijqkmzn/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
