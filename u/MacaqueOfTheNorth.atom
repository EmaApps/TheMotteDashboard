&amp;gt;if fathers were generally better than children, we should have long since reached that last grade of badness beyond which it is impossible to grow worse.

This is flawed reasoning. There is one respect in which we know with certainty that fathers are generally ~~worse~~ better than their children: the quality of their genes. The average person has more deleterious genetic variants than his parents. Natural selection prevents this effect from compounding each generation by causing people with better genes to have more children, so that the probability distribution of who a random person&#39;s parents are has better average genes than a random sampling of that generation.

Similarly with culture, there could be some kind of selection effect countering actual cultural decline that is happening on some level.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih1o33s/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
