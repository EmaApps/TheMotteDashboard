I&#39;ve never been a weightlifter, as my exercise has always been cardio of some form primarily (running, swimming, biking). I fell off the horse a little during and immediately after college, and getting married added a lot of things onto my plate that let me gain quite a bit of weight.

So, after a few months of kicking the can down the road, I finally got a gym membership a month ago and have been going consistently. I was prepared for the effects to take a while and I&#39;ve been slowly incrementing weight to where I&#39;m pushing 20 lb plates now. I have actually been mildly surprised at how quickly I have been dropping weight and building muscle. My stomach fat has declined somewhat, and my running pace to and from the gym has increased noticably to where I am running, not jogging, and it feels incredible.

I&#39;m still trying to manage my diet, as my and my wife&#39;s schedules give us a lot of excuses to take the easy route of not cooking. However, I&#39;m finding better alternatives to what I was eating and drinking and I&#39;m slowly building new eating habits. I don&#39;t have a scale to measure myself, but my activity, vitality, and attitude have been sky-high for the last month.

Ultimately my crazy goal is to train for a triathlon. I&#39;ve been gassing up some buddies for years and I finally am in a place where I can consistently work out. I have my sights set on a half ironman, as I trained for and failed to complete one years ago. My goal weight is a bit up in the air, but I want to hit 20%ish body fat before I start training hard again. Ideally, I&#39;m 5&#39;11&#34; so my guess is around 180-200, but I&#39;m not sure how muscle weight works into that.

I know there are some endurance guys in this community, as well as some fitness-focused people. I&#39;m kind of curious to gauge what the community might think about a collective fitness challenge. Something like a &#34;complete a tri&#34; or &#34;complete a half marathon&#34; with some sort of meet-up for a race somewhere. Let me know if there is interest in something like that and I can brainstorm some ideas to follow up with. I&#39;m going to aim to do races anyway, but getting some sort of community to aim with is something I haven&#39;t really done before, and it would be a cool challenge. Comment and critique is obviously welcome.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w9703v/wellness_wednesday_for_july_27_2022/ihvee4s/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
