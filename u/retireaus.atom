I see this phrase used all the time in contexts that seem almost oppposite.

Joe is a 27 year old dentist, highly successful, but got into dentistry because his parents wanted him to. He decides to take a 6 month holiday in south america to &#34;find himself&#34;, hiking, partying and travelling, and comes back refreshed and ready to grind dentistry for another 5 years.

Sam is a 25 year old loser stereotype. Lives with his parents playing world of warcraft while working 30 hours a week as assistant manager at the local burger king. Started a degree in computer science but never finished it. Sam decides to &#34;find himself&#34;, a process which involves joining a gym, taking steroids, and getting into bodybuilder culture. He later competes as an amateur bodybuilder and starts an instagram, and appears to have higher self esteem, though the excessive focus on bodybuilding and steroids seems slightly unsavoury. His newfound lifestyle at least allows him to start dating, though he still lives with his mum and has racked up a problematic credit card debt.

Anne is a practicing surgeon and has a high pressure full time job. Anne decides to take on higher paying contract work for 12 months, which is similarly high pressured, which she describes as &#34;finding herself&#34;.

So finding yourself sort of seems like reevaluating your priorities in life, possibly changing them, possibly keeping them the same but with a firmer grasp on the underlying reasons, possibly changing your behaviours slightly but leaving your personality largely unchanged with slightly more money or sex partners, possibly focusing on short term financial goals to defer more profound goals until later.

I sort of see threads of commonality, but it also feels functionally like a just-so story for any set of behaviours whatsoever. Self improvement? Find yourself. 6 month holiday? Find yourself. Divorce and start dating fresh? Find yourself. Take on higher paying contract role? Find yourself.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/iftth4n/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
