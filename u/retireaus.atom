Eddie Holmes was the leader of the team publishing a recent study in Nature pushing the Wuhan market spillover hypothesis, to much acclaim from the usual suspects who see lab-leak as some sort of right wing agenda.

Details of the work below - note two authors EC Holmes, Australian professor, and Shi Z, head of the Wuhan Institute of Virologies efforts to capture bat viruses and modify them to infect human cells.

Note that Eddie Holmes declared he had &#34;no conflict of interest&#34; when publishing his findings that the virus originated in the Wuhan market. He has been suspiciously loud about shouting down the lab origins theory for the past two years, while hiding his involvement working with that very lab.

I am now very interested in what other viruses Holmes helped Wuhan scientists acquire.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wos3do/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_15_2022/ikcupji/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
