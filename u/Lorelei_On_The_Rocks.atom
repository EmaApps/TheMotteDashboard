It&#39;s hard to get psyched up about GOP governors going after CRT or cracking down on left-wing corporations, and it&#39;s hard to see it as anything more than a rear-guard action. As long as the left controls the narrative, which they will continue to do since they control media, movies, social media, etc. Hard power can&#39;t prevail against soft-power in the long-term. Seems like the only way the right could get anything like a lasting victory would be to somehow seize control of cultural institutions, but that is a far more difficult thing to do than to seize control of stage legislatures or governors&#39; mansions.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wj1cwt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_08_2022/ijngiha/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
