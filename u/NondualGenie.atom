Two I learned this week (coincidentally both about religion) are:

Marx’s “religion is the opium of the masses” is actually  &#34;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.&#34; Also opium was much more widely accepted in Europe at the time.

John Adam’s quote about how “the US is in no way a Christian nation” was from a treaty signed with Muslim Tripoli and guaranteed by the Ottomans. The full quote is: “the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion,—as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen [Muslims],—and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan [Mohammedan] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.” Adams himself was a deeply religious, church-going Unitarian.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/ig9bzx0/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
