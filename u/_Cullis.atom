A journalist from an outfit that is hellbanned on reddit finds that ex-CIA [people have been hired](https://archive.ph/Aykej) to manage Facebook content policies.   


There&#39;s a [nice video](https://twitter.com/AlanRMacLeod/status/1546969640546582529) , where a the guy is explaining his role in developing rules  for permissible content to a sympathetic suitably ethnic looking woman.    


Doesn&#39;t mention he worked 17 years for the CIA, left there as [a senior analytic manager at CIA](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXfuD5HWYAkobwY?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=large), with a focus on &#34;impact of influence operations on social movements, security and democracy&#34;.      


&amp;gt;Aaron Berman has devoted his career to making online spaces safe and constructive for democracy and civic discussion. He has more than two decades of experience in tech policy and national security, with a focus in online trust and safety and content moderation, first at the CIA and now at Meta (formerly Facebook). He has a Masters in Public Policy from Georgetown and BA from Williams College in computer science and music.  


At least his linkedin is honest!</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1j84r/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
