It&#39;s a  perhaps overly literate space opera series from early 1990s, and while some of it has aged gracefully (e.g. in the future, everyone has a smartphone and/or comm implants and people get withdrawals if they&#39;re deprived) .. there are some parts that really didn&#39;t.

(set cca 2600 or so)

&amp;gt;I was thinking about how free of mobs recent centuries had been: **to create a mob there must be public meetings,** and public meetings in our time consisted of individuals communing via the All Thing or other datasphere channels; it is hard to create mob passion when people are separated by kilometers and light-years, connected only by comm lines and fatline threads.

Indeed, it seems  that networking supercharges mobs, and the networked ones are even worse than the physical  ones.  They don&#39;t dississipate when they get hungry and tired, and they keep egging each other on.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ife1wvw/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
