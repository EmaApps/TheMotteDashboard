A journalist from an outfit that is hellbanned on reddit finds that ex-CIA [people have been hired](https://archive.ph/Aykej) to manage Facebook content policies.   


There&#39;s a [nice video](https://twitter.com/AlanRMacLeod/status/1546969640546582529) , where a the guy is explaining his role in developing rules  for permissible content to a sympathetic suitably ethnic looking woman.    


Doesn&#39;t mention he worked 17 years for the CIA, left there as [a senior analytic manager at CIA](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXfuD5HWYAkobwY?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=large), with a focus on &#34;impact of influence operations on social movements, security and democracy&#34;.      


&amp;gt;Aaron Berman has devoted his career to making online spaces safe and constructive for democracy and civic discussion. He has more than two decades of experience in tech policy and national security, with a focus in online trust and safety and content moderation, first at the CIA and now at Meta (formerly Facebook). He has a Masters in Public Policy from Georgetown and BA from Williams College in computer science and music.  


At least his linkedin is honest!</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/ig1j84r/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ife1wvw/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] I&#39;m re-reading the Hyperion books at the moment.

It&#39;s a  perhaps overly literate space opera series from early 1990s, and while some of it has aged gracefully (e.g. in the future, everyone has a smartphone and/or comm implants and people get withdrawals if they&#39;re deprived) .. there are some parts that really didn&#39;t.

(set cca 2600 or so)

&amp;gt;I was thinking about how free of mobs recent centuries had been: **to create a mob there must be public meetings,** and public meetings in our time consisted of individuals communing via the All Thing or other datasphere channels; it is hard to create mob passion when people are separated by kilometers and light-years, connected only by comm lines and fatline threads.

Indeed, it seems  that networking supercharges mobs, and the networked ones are even worse than the physical  ones.  They don&#39;t dississipate when they get hungry and tired, and they keep egging each other on.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vu2vu3/friday_fun_thread_for_july_08_2022/ife1wvw/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
