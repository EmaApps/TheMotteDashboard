Ukraine says Russians did it themselves with IEDs,[covered by sound of a MLRS battery firing nearby.](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1553037563065155585)

Since Russia has been very clear they&#39;re in Ukraine to &#39;denazify it&#39;, killing their own nazi-tatto covered walking propaganda prizes they could have hanged at their own leisure .. doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense.

Russians say it was Ukrainians using GMLRS missiles and have produced some wreckage. There were some POWs videos of Azov prisoners recently, but I don&#39;t really see the motivation - nobody with a brain should take POW videos seriously; people under duress will say anything.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w7h8wa/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_25_2022/ii78aft/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
