I.e., someone who makes a diet and workout routine for you and checks in once a month or so to update it. In particular, I&#39;m looking for one that&#39;s very metrics-/goal-oriented, which is why I thought this sub might be a good place to ask.

I know that there are free online workout plans I can follow instead that are just as good but spending money to overcome procrastination &amp;amp; motivation issues is a good tradeoff for me here.)</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w9703v/wellness_wednesday_for_july_27_2022/ihvc4ob/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
