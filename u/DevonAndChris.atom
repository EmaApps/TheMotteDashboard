And I am -- okay with this? I guess? I worry that consolidation is choking out minority viewpoints, and a lot of the conversation is about that. [Stephen King](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/stephen-king-testified-against-publishings-224159979.html) opposed it so the headlines about being too scary for King write themselves.

My personal hope is that it stops the industry from choking off anti-woke viewpoints. And it might do that. Or completely fail at that. I have been tragically wrong before.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iit4mxc/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
