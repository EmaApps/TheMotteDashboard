Short version: A consumer can buy a 30 TB hard drive off of Alibaba or Walmart&#39;s website (which is a reseller using them as a storefront).

The capacity is fake. Someone wrote hacked firmware so that two flash drives have (each) 512MB of actual storage self-report as 15TB. When you go to use it, the hacked firmware pretends to write the files and creates the whole directory structure. The directory structure is the only permanent part. The file contents start getting overwritten once you put in too much data. Someone could buy this and take a while to realize that their data is dead.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x5fpqj/smallscale_question_sunday_for_september_04_2022/in4d1jz/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
