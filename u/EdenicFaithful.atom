I&#39;m reading Albert Ellis&#39; *Reason And Emotion In Psychotherapy*, at least for now. Not sure if I&#39;m interested enough, but he was a pioneer in cognitive therapies. So far he seems to have added a layer on top of behavioural conditioning, where the words that people use to &#34;self-indoctrinate&#34; themselves function as a reward/punishment mechanism. So even if you use Freudian analysis to reveal the roots of someone&#39;s problems, you still have to deal with the mechanism by which those problems are reinforced. He argues that these self-indoctrinating words often hide irrational premises, which, when noticed and challenged, leads to improvement.

To be honest, the simplicity of the model (I suppose it will get more complex) raises an eyebrow, but perhaps I&#39;ll learn something useful. It is true enough that kneading one&#39;s resentments like dough is a questionable use of time that often goes unchecked.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijcht7i/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
