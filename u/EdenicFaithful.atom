I&#39;m picking up Pinker&#39;s *Rationality*. I attempted a while back to get through his Harvard lectures, but couldn&#39;t maintain interest. Perhaps I&#39;ll do better in text. Seems to have a fair amount of overlap with LessWrong-style thinking. I confess that I read these kinds of texts more like a medieval logic treatise that needs interpretation to get some use out of in one&#39;s life, than actually trying to learn how to think. Still, perhaps I&#39;ll learn something.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wzobg4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_28_2022/im5ub2m/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
