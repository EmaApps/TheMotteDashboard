I&#39;m reading Nystrom&#39;s *Project of a New System of Arithmetic*, which makes the case for switching to a hexadecimal system for things like clocks (seems like a 16-hour day with 90 decimal minutes per hour?).

Emic and etic are used for the &#34;inside view&#34; and &#34;outside view&#34; of a group respectively.

The gnomic aspect is the tense of aphorism.

E&#39; (E-Prime) ~~is~~ means English without using the verb &#34;to be.&#34;</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vzgha1/friday_fun_thread_for_july_15_2022/igb5i4r/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
