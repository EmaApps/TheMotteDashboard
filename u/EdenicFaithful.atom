I&#39;m reading Nystrom&#39;s *Project of a New System of Arithmetic*, which makes the case for switching to a hexadecimal system for things like clocks (seems like a 16-hour day with 90 decimal minutes per hour?). Skimming it shows that he somehow applies hexadecimal to other things like music. Does not seem like anyone has ever taken it seriously, but it&#39;s short and maybe interesting.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w10nh1/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_17_2022/igjglwo/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
