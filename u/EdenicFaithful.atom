I&#39;m picking up Levy&#39;s *Hackers*, frankly because I was curious about the strangely eastern touches of many cyberpunk styles one sees in film. Per the [Jargon File](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/),

&amp;gt;...many hackers are influenced to varying degrees by Zen Buddhism or (less commonly) Taoism, and blend them easily with their &#39;native&#39; religions. There is a definite strain of mystical, almost Gnostic sensibility that shows up even among those hackers not actively involved with neo-paganism, Discordianism, or Zen. Hacker folklore that pays homage to &#39;wizards&#39; and speaks of incantations and demons has too much psychological truthfulness about it to be entirely a joke.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/v053ii/smallscale_question_sunday_for_may_29_2022/iagd0l4/"/></entry></feed>
