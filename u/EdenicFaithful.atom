I&#39;m starting Minsky&#39;s *Society of Mind*, a classic AI text about building minds from smaller, mindless components. The current zeitgeist seems to be moving away from classic AI, but eventually we&#39;ll need better understanding of where precisely our machine-learning models fit in the broader scheme of knowledge. &#34;Shut up and scale&#34; doesn&#39;t seem entirely satisfactory. Maybe going over some slightly dust-covered ideas might spark some useful thinking. The book itself seems like a mix of aesthetic quirks and precision, and I seem to be in the mood for that.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x5fpqj/smallscale_question_sunday_for_september_04_2022/in38d61/?sort=confidence"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x3t1mp/friday_fun_thread_for_september_02_2022/in0149g/?sort=confidence</id><title type="text">[FF] I finally noticed that MATE, a continuation of GNOME 2, exists.
