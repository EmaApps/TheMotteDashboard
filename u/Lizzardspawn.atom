But it is an important variable. And probably a potent line of attack for the right. I feel that the left will be easily baited in not putting an upper bound and the extreme right is already at 0 so it is already priced in so to say.

Btw my google fu seems to have failed me since I didn&#39;t manage to find a graph for distribution per number of abortions per woman for women that get them. If there happens to be a cohort of women with quite high number - this could make them a very soft and hard to defend target.

For me - the max number should be around 2-3 so women can have out in a critical periods of their life  - &#34;I was young and stupid&#34;, &#34;I am too old for that shit&#34;, &#34;The universe really hates me, just not now&#34;</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igd5kzu/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
