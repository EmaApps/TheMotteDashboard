- Distinguish between *sex* and *gender*. 
  - Sex is a biological fact. Gender is primarily a feeling and is more malleable. 
  - A &#34;transwoman&#34; can thus be referred to as a male (who identifies as woman) without any controversy.
     - It is no longer &#34;women&#39;s sports&#34;, but &#34;female sports&#34;. Or not even that, but &#34;feminine hormonal profile sports&#34;.
  - Conservatives tend to defend &#34;women&#34; as a biological reality, but this is of course incorrect. Sex is the only biological reality. Their &#34;tradwives&#34; are merely females who have taken on a particular identity.
- Eliminate gender from language as much as possible
  - In English, stop using gender-specific pronouns. Replace them with gender-neutral pronouns. This means replacing &#34;he&#34; and &#34;she&#34; with either &#34;they&#34; (weird!) or &#34;he&#34; (as gender-neutral use).
  - The whole controversy around &#34;birthing people&#34; vs &#34;woman&#34; can be ended by referring to those people simply as &#34;females&#34;.
- Free speech segues into free thinking. 
  - Everyone is allowed to *think* that another person&#39;s identity (whether it is gender identity or not is irrelevant) is not a fact but only a feeling (and *their* feeling). This could be a &#34;transwoman&#34;&#39;s identity or a &#34;tradwife&#34;&#39;s identity. I&#39;m not required to accept it as reality. I respect their feelings, but it is not a fact.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vwbj4s/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_11_2022/igajyb8/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
