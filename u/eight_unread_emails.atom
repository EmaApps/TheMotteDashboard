Let&#39;s also say that I&#39;m worried about anti-democratic tendencies that I feel like I observe from former president Trump and his faction of the Republican party. Does it make sense for me to become a republican and support the not-Trump/&#34;normal&#34; republicans in internal elections? The party seems to be at a tipping point on the &#34;Trump good/bad&#34; issue, and a small number of votes could have an outsized impact, as far as I can see. Are there any personal costs incurred by doing this (beyond risking getting more involved in mind-killing politics)? Are there safeguards in place keeping people like me from joining the party?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/x0hc17/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_29_2022/im90px1/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
