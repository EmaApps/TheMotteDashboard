I saw a [few](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ihdw15n/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ihh363a/?context=3) getting stuck into /u/self_made_human&#39;s enthusiasm for posthuman life as an end in and of itself, rather than due to the risks involved. They seemed more popular than the post itself. I&#39;ll admit the way he expressed it was fairly enthusiastic and unambiguously attacked various holies like nature.

But is this disagreement substantive as opposed to aesthetic? It&#39;s reasonable to be sceptical of proposals promising massive political, economic, biological, neurological change. There are all kinds of problems with this, imbalances of power and so on. But I think there&#39;s also an aesthetic objection that comes before practical objections. See the fairly famous [comic](https://twitter.com/merryweatherey/status/1185636106257211392). 

It does appear fairly dystopian if everyone is just a lump of meat in a featureless, rusty pod. Dripped up like a drug addict, muscles wasting away, puddles of drool... The source of protein probably would be bugs or some synthetic cocktail. Connotations: pod, bugs, cattle, drug-addict, weakness, dependence, unreal.

If you reword self-made-human&#39;s proposal as calling for ultimate mastery over the universe so that everyone can do whatever they want, what&#39;s wrong with that? What about the will to power? What about moving ever forward as a technological civilization? What about the urge to climb mountains and conquer the stars?

Imagine instead that you&#39;re an ascended intelligence with a body that spans kilometres, absorbing the ferocious energies of the Sun for fuel, in a constant state of hyperawareness about the universe. You know more than our civilization, you think thoughts we can&#39;t even imagine. You&#39;re watching your neighbours if they try to infringe upon your million-trillionth of the Sun, armed and ready. You play, modify and return games with your friends. You&#39;re in discussion with all kinds of obscure communities, you&#39;re politically engaged in the debates about interstellar travel: who will get to take the next few stars? Connotations: immortal, celestial, inhuman but immensely powerful.

I bring up positivism because there is what I think is an aesthetically motivated backlash against positivism. I was talking with [/u/IG111](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iiq0nl4/), who objected to 

&amp;gt;The real world is only a very complex technical environment with various parameters to optimize.

Isn&#39;t this the case? Don&#39;t we want to maximize fun (interpreted broadly as some combination of romantic love, good conversation, physical competition, intellectual activity)? Don&#39;t we want to maximize our power in the universe? Perhaps we don&#39;t know what parameters we want, perhaps our optimization ability is constrained and perverted by technical limitations. Perhaps we took one step forward and two steps back because of these limitations. But in principle, isn&#39;t optimizing the end-goal?

That seems to me to be the inevitable end goal of positivism. You use empirical experiments to acquire power and get what you want. There&#39;s been a reaction on the left away from positivism, that&#39;s where we got critical theory and the degrowth/anti-industrial wings of environmentalism. But there aren&#39;t many critical theorists on the motte. 

I think there&#39;s also been a movement on the right away from positivism, examples above. See:

&amp;gt;godless (metaphorically) science fiction version of paradise

&amp;gt;Nothing, they&#39;ll be stuck in a pod or chip doing nothing.

I think there&#39;s a bunch of right-coded concepts about the value of strength, personal sovereignty and hubris floating around that makes people object to certain cultural conceptions of the positivist vision (epitomized by the [comic](https://twitter.com/merryweatherey/status/1185636106257211392) above). Is this so? Or am I just bad at modelling?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iiribg9/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
