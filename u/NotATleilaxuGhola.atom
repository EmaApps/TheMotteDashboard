These days I feel like I&#39;ve achieved nearly all of my life goals, but I&#39;m pained with the knowledge that I can&#39;t stay in this particular stage of my life forever.  The summer of my life will one day end, and I&#39;ll pass into autumn and winter.  There&#39;s a bittersweet beauty to how transient life is and how fleeting moments of fulfillment are.  It&#39;s both pleasurable and painful, like just the right amount of DOMS after a good workout.  I wish I were more poetic or artistic so I could express the sensation better than this.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wchwo3/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_31_2022/iicqf8c/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
