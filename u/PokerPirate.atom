Specifically, how can I reconcile the following two observations:

1. first borns tend to have higher achievement (as measured by wealth/education/etc) as adults

1. the 2nd/3rd/etc child will tend to walk/talk earlier than the first because they are trying &#34;to keep up&#34; with their big brother/sister

Why is it the case that having an older sibling is helpful for young infant development, but not in the latter years?  Or am I misinterpreting these results and that&#39;s not actually the case?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vvl5yv/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_10_2022/ifvndpf/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
