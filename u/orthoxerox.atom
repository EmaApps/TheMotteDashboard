Alon Levy has already remarked that &#34;it’s remarkable that the areas covered by Momentum are consistently ones on which the only thing to learn from the United States is what not to do. There are seven target areas: transport infrastructure projects, climate change mitigation, transport safety, regional corridors, logistics supply chains, emerging tech (e.g. smart cities), good regulatory practices.&#34;

&#34;There is approximately one thing the US has to teach other countries, but it’s nowhere within USDOT’s portfolio: people who are familiar with the history of infrastructure construction in the early 20th century, when it was labor-intensive because everything was labor-intensive then by today’s standards, should teach these methods to countries with similar GDP per capita to Gilded Age and Progressive Era America, like India or Nigeria, so that they can use their advantage in low-cost labor and avoid importing expensive machinery or use techniques that only make sense with modern first-world wages.&#34;

What should be the best countries *for the US* to learn from?

- transport infrastructure: probably Japan for HSR (China is building a lot, but it still has access to low-cost labor), Switzerland (for integrated timetables)
- climate change mitigation - eh, not touching this topic
- transport safety - Sweden and the Netherlands (the former came up with Vision Zero, the latter took it to the next level)
- regional corridors - Germany (the rejuvenation of Rhine-Ruhr has been going much better the rejuvenation of the Rust Belt) and probably even Italy (it knows how to build regional corridors around small and medium enterprises)
- logistics supply chains - okay, maybe this is something the US is not bad at
- emerging tech (e.g. smart cities) - PRC and maybe South Korea
- good regulatory practices - the Netherlands and Finland are known for boring good governance, but they are small, out of larger developed countries I would probably pick Germany</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vr0t4v/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_04_2022/iesl0eg/"/></entry><entry><id>http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ieoufhi/</id><title type="text">[SQ] Would you prefer to die after being completely bedridden for 20 years or being c</title><updated>2022-07-03T12:28:27Z</updated><author><name>orthoxerox</name></author><category label="SQ" scheme="https://themotte.srid.ca/sq" term="Small-Scale Question"/><content type="text">Would you prefer to die after being completely bedridden for 20 years or being completely demented for 20 years?

I&#39;ve been wearing prescription glasses for eleven years now, but I&#39;ve never been a big fan of sunglasses. But something (early onset midlife crisis?) prompted me to get a pair this summer.

First of all, modern technology is fucking magical. You sit in front of your computer, switch the webcam on and the website plonks pair after pair on your mug, letting you turn your head to see how you look from every angle. Anyway, after an evening of looking at shades I had an idea of what I wanted: not very big aviators or not very aggressive wraparounds.

So, armed with this information, I girdle up my loins and hit the friendly neighborhood mini-mall, which has an optical store. &#34;Sunglasses,&#34; says I. &#34;You&#39;ve come to the right place,&#34; says the paraoptician. &#34;*Prescription* sunglasses,&#34; I clarify. &#34;Not a problem,&#34; says the paraoptician, &#34;what&#39;s your prescription?&#34; I pull out my phone and find the picture of it. &#34;Not an *insurmountable* problem,&#34; she hastily corrects herself, &#34;but you&#39;d better stay away from aviators or wraparound sunglasses with eyes like yours.&#34; Seeing me visibly deflate after this one-two of hers, she explains that lenses for myopia become too thick at the edges at aviator sizes, you can&#39;t just stick them into a thin metal frame, and wraparounds are extremely hard to correct for astigmatism. She leads me to the display case with reasonably flat sunglasses of reasonable size, but I try a few of them on and don&#39;t like myself in them one bit.

We part ways, and entitled to a second opinion, I take the subway to the nearest proper mall with a couple more optical stores. I do the same thing, expecting a different result, and come home disheartened. Then an idea strikes me. Or two ideas, even.

Idea number one: what do the elves of Valinor say about prescription lenses? I dive into the murky depths of SEO-optimized websites of American opticians, amd resurface with a single word: atoric. Which is like aspherical, but for toric lenses (the ones for astigmatism). Unfortunately, no one in Russia knows anything about atoric, atorical, atoroidal lenses.

Idea number two: sports. There *must* be alpine skiers, cyclists, skeet shooters and other people with bad eyesight, and they all want prescription sunglasses glasses of the wraparoundest variety. What&#39;s more, they want them to be thin, light and with proper correction across the whole field of vision. I dive into the equally murky depths of SEO-optimized Runet, and bingo! I come back with a few bookmarks for companies that *do* make prescription lenses for active sports.

To cut a long story short, I am now a not very proud owner of Ray-Ban Baloramas, but the prescription lenses must wait until the summer is over, because otherwise *I* would be waiting for them to get made until the summer was over. Optics are fucking complex, don&#39;t let high school physics fool you.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vosrph/friday_fun_thread_for_july_01_2022/iehnm0w/"/></entry></feed>
