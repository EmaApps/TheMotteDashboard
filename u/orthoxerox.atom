I&#39;ve been wearing prescription glasses for eleven years now, but I&#39;ve never been a big fan of sunglasses. But something (early onset midlife crisis?) prompted me to get a pair this summer.

First of all, modern technology is fucking magical. You sit in front of your computer, switch the webcam on and the website plonks pair after pair on your mug, letting you turn your head to see how you look from every angle. Anyway, after an evening of looking at shades I had an idea of what I wanted: not very big aviators or not very aggressive wraparounds.

So, armed with this information, I girdle up my loins and hit the friendly neighborhood mini-mall, which has an optical store. &#34;Sunglasses,&#34; says I. &#34;You&#39;ve come to the right place,&#34; says the paraoptician. &#34;*Prescription* sunglasses,&#34; I clarify. &#34;Not a problem,&#34; says the paraoptician, &#34;what&#39;s your prescription?&#34; I pull out my phone and find the picture of it. &#34;Not an *insurmountable* problem,&#34; she hastily corrects herself, &#34;but you&#39;d better stay away from aviators or wraparound sunglasses with eyes like yours.&#34; Seeing me visibly deflate after this one-two of hers, she explains that lenses for myopia become too thick at the edges at aviator sizes, you can&#39;t just stick them into a thin metal frame, and wraparounds are extremely hard to correct for astigmatism. She leads me to the display case with reasonably flat sunglasses of reasonable size, but I try a few of them on and don&#39;t like myself in them one bit.

We part ways, and entitled to a second opinion, I take the subway to the nearest proper mall with a couple more optical stores. I do the same thing, expecting a different result, and come home disheartened. Then an idea strikes me. Or two ideas, even.

Idea number one: what do the elves of Valinor say about prescription lenses? I dive into the murky depths of SEO-optimized websites of American opticians, amd resurface with a single word: atoric. Which is like aspherical, but for toric lenses (the ones for astigmatism). Unfortunately, no one in Russia knows anything about atoric, atorical, atoroidal lenses.

Idea number two: sports. There *must* be alpine skiers, cyclists, skeet shooters and other people with bad eyesight, and they all want prescription sunglasses glasses of the wraparoundest variety. What&#39;s more, they want them to be thin, light and with proper correction across the whole field of vision. I dive into the equally murky depths of SEO-optimized Runet, and bingo! I come back with a few bookmarks for companies that *do* make prescription lenses for active sports.

To cut a long story short, I am now a not very proud owner of Ray-Ban Baloramas, but the prescription lenses must wait until the summer is over, because otherwise *I* would be waiting for them to get made until the summer was over. Optics are fucking complex, don&#39;t let high school physics fool you.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vosrph/friday_fun_thread_for_july_01_2022/iehnm0w/"/></entry></feed>
