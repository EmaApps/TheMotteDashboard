That the founding ideals of our civilization are not dead, that conflict theory is wrong, and that excessive amounts of time, effort and intellect are expended curating collections of the ugliest stories the internet can find to justify visiting more harm on our fellow country(wo)men. I *still* can&#39;t think of a way to push back against this cultural rot, this inverse of CCP-propaganda where everything is terrible instead of everything being peachy, beyond highlighting examples where this isn&#39;t the case. While my last attempt convinced [approximately nobody,](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/i6yuis/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_10_2020/g1npsjq/?context=999) I&#39;ve been urged by multiple people to be better lately. So hop on buckoes and buckettes, we&#39;re about to take another spin on the merry-go-round.

[Four days ago at a mall in Indiana](https://www.foxnews.com/us/indiana-police-say-good-samaritan-took-out-mall-shooter-15-seconds-landed-8-of-10-shots), 20 year old Jonathan Sapirman opened fire with a rifle, killing three and injuring two more. He was &#39;neutralized&#39; by bystander-with-a-gun Elisjsha Dicken within 15 seconds. Here&#39;s the [front page article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/18/us/greenwood-indiana-mall-shooting.html) the NYT ran:

&amp;gt;By that time, the gunman, identified by the police as Jonathan Douglas Sapirman, 20, had already killed three people and injured two others. But the deadly spree on Sunday was cut short by a 22-year-old bystander carrying a handgun while shopping with his girlfriend.  

&amp;gt;Chief Jim Ison of the Greenwood Police Department called the bystander’s actions “nothing short of heroic,” identifying him as Elisjsha Dicken of Seymour, Ind.
&amp;gt;“He engaged the gunman from quite a distance with a handgun, was very proficient in that, very tactically sound, and, as he moved to close in on the suspect, he was also motioning for people to exit behind him,” Chief Ison said at a news conference where he described surveillance video footage of the shooting.
&amp;gt;“This young man, Greenwood’s good Samaritan, acted within seconds, stopping the shooter and saving countless lives,” Mayor Mark Myers said on Monday.

There&#39;s no reference in the article to gun control, nothing about the NRA/gun lobby, nothing about the fact that the shooter [posted an image of a nazi officer on 4chan](https://www.thedailybeast.com/greenwood-mall-shooter-jonathan-sapirman-appeared-to-post-chilling-message-on-4chan-with-nazi-imagery?ref=scroll) prior to the shooting. The &#39;White Nationalist nazi probably-Trump supporting incel shoots 3 hispanic people&#39; story practically writes itself here. There&#39;s a short paragraph about the victims that&#39;s almost an afterthought:

&amp;gt;The Johnson County coroner identified the victims, who were all from Indianapolis, as Victor Gomez, 30; and a husband and wife, Pedro Pineda, 56, and Rosa Mirian Rivera de Pineda, 37. Two additional people were injured: a 22-year-old woman hospitalized with a leg wound and a 12-year-old girl struck by a bullet fragment.

It&#39;s mostly just glowing praise for the good samaritan who shot the kid. There&#39;s no reference to statistics that most mass shootings aren&#39;t stopped by bystanders (although they did [run another article later that made that claim)](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/us/armed-bystander-indiana-mall-shooting.html). They also ran another [largely neutral story](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/17/us/greenwood-mall-shooting-indiana.html) along with a video of [police officers praising the bystander](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000008449377/indiana-mall-shooting-suspect.html). 

Fox News ran a story with this headline: [&#39;Media downplays ‘good Samaritan’ narrative following Indiana shooting, firearms experts weigh in&#39;](https://www.foxnews.com/media/media-downplays-good-samaritan-narrative-following-indiana-shooting-firearms-experts-weigh-in), because I suppose the NYT coverage was too biased. 

The substance to their accusations of criticism:

&amp;gt;The New York Times also weighed on the debate in a piece written by Richard Fausset, Eliza Fawcett and Serge F. Kovaleski, acknowledging that although Dicken’s actions were &#34;heroic,&#34; they were also a &#34;statistical unicorn.&#34; Citing an expert on gun policy at UCLA, they wrote most states that require a permit to carry a firearm do not require active shooter response training, and that if good guys with guns was the answer, training would be required across the board. 

A point which does not seem to be rebutted in the article. This is the closest I can find to a refutation:

&amp;gt;Cam Edwards, the editor of Second Amendment news site Bearing Arms, claimed that media coverage is simply biased when it comes to concealed carry, and more specifically, the idea that armed citizens &#34;can and do save lives.&#34; He also stressed the importance of proper gun training.  
&amp;gt;&#34;Every situation is different, of course, but generally speaking if someone has the means and the training to engage an individual who&#39;s actively trying to murder as many innocent people as possible I don&#39;t see any reason why we wouldn&#39;t want them to act as quickly as possible,&#34; he told Fox News Digital.  
&amp;gt;Smith too encouraged proper gun training, and said that the idea of a &#34;good guy with a gun&#34; argument is definitely &#34;situation specific.&#34; Nevertheless, she urged gun owners who heard of the Indiana shooting to get the proper resources, and not to irresponsibly dive into an active shooter situation.   

I suspect I&#39;m going to get the same answers as last time, but...what more do you want from the legacy media? They run this (in my opinion) almost right-slanted story and still get smeared as being ideologically biased. Red tribe still hates the fake news NYT and will never read this anyways, which serves Trump and the Republican party well. (Un)Surprisingly, this incident and the media coverage hasn&#39;t been discussed around here, so you aren&#39;t rewarding them for it. Why not? Why is it so rare that this space highlights a good deed or a de-escalation as opposed to dancing around the twitter bonfire like [Jack&#39;s tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies) and feeding on accelerationism?

Maybe when you read the next hot take trashing this or that outlet (including Fox news!), consider the many stories like this one that fly under the radar.

Apologies in advance, but I&#39;ll be busy this weekend and likely won&#39;t participate much in the comments.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/w1s5b7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_18_2022/ih8dtll/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
