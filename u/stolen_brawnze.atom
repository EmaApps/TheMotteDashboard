I knew such a long fast was theoretically possible, but I figured it would come with some sort of lasting damage. Jesus did 40 days, but the lifestyle of Jesus was not built for earthly longevity to begin with. Mr. Beast&#39;s team of doctors didn&#39;t seem worried about it, however. 

There was one small wrinkle, though, which was that he had scheduled a video shoot with *Gordon fucking Ramsey* during the period he was supposed to be fasting. He made it a full two weeks, when Gordon pretty unabashedly bullied Mr. Beast into trying his egg sandwich. He lost 20 lbs!</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vosrph/friday_fun_thread_for_july_01_2022/iem9m2x/"/></entry></feed>
