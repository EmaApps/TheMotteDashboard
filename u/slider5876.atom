What’s up with the CFTC shutting down Predictit?  It’s fairly popular with intellectuals and researchers.  Financial markets look at them.  Policy researchers use Prediction markets for planning.  It’s honestly a thing I believe we should look to scale up and not scale back.  I can see 2 reasons why the Biden administration wants to shut them down.

1.  They can’t control the narrative if prediction markets exists and view them as against their cause.

2.  Someone with more political pull wants in to start their own market.  CME, NYSE, etc.

3.  This doesn’t have any big narrative.  It’s just some bureaucrat decided he’s bored at work and their technically violating agreements.

My prediction will be their allowed to stay.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/ij74vts/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
