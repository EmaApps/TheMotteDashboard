I feel like you have to be almost 40 now to remember this; but remember inflight meals?

Serving meals on flights makes absolutely no sense, but at the same time I kind of miss it.  It had to be expensive to serve meals on flights because it’s literally added weight and taking up expensive space.  No one on the ground would pay the price I think it costs.  My guess is $20-30 a meal.  They are sort of like MRE for the military.  Very specific portion sizes.  Supposedly the portion size that a person is suppose to eat; which is smaller than what eat but then you had more courses than I eat.

From nostalgia perspective the food was different than what you would buy on the ground.  It was optimized to taste ok in the air.

The economics of why we got rid of that are obvious.  No one is willing to pay $30 for an in flight meal that’s terrible compared to ground food.

And yes I know you can still fly first and get that, but it use to be any 3 hr flight.  And now we have an entire generation that has never experienced bad but interesting in flight meals.

And how I know it’s bad economics for in flight meals - would anyone pay $35 a person if I opened a restaurant with airline food?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vqb0xe/smallscale_question_sunday_for_july_03_2022/ieo612g/"/></entry></feed>
