Since they always try to get more money out of you.

1.  Does anyone pay the $25-50 to get a more forward seat on a plane?  I was on a plane with no middle seat - 2 seats on each sides.  I can understand paying for not middle seat but whose shelling out cash for the same seat 10-15 rows closer to front.

2.  Also noticed a pop up to board early for like $22.  Who pays that?  Personally I generally board last to minimize time inside plane.

Is there something Iâ€™m missing where these items are heavily valued?</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wi8rc4/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_07_2022/ijf8o56/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
