I went out with a hot girl and described myself as sort of autistic.  Assume a decent amount of people here are in that group.  And nowadays that’s databale.  Like I have text receipts where I got in an argument with someone and they made fun of me for being autistic.  Sort of work in HFT.  I went to math tournaments as a kid.  So I guess my question is what’s like an autistic versus I’m a normie who can do math.  I guess musks claimed it but is he really that or just smart?  Nowadays it’s beneficial to just let people put you in that group.</content><link href="http://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wtsdor/smallscale_question_sunday_for_august_21_2022/il8f1zq/?sort=confidence"/></entry></feed>
