    "body": "[Historians advise the president. The problem? The scholars were all white.](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/04/1120561788/historians-advise-the-president-the-problem-the-scholars-were-all-white)\n\n\n&gt;When President Biden spoke on Sept. 1st, to tell the nation that democracy is in danger, his warnings echoed the words of many who have been paying attention. Especially those who study the past. Not a month earlier, the president met with a group of handpicked historians who told him that democracy was teetering, hanging on by a thread.\n\nNPR is running this piece in their history section today. Out of five (!) scholars advising the President, all five are *White*. Not a single person of color. The article links to WaPo, which mentions that’s Biden’s speechwriter Vishy Reddy was at the table when the historians advised Biden a month ago. We can assume that this meeting influenced Biden’s anti white nationalism speech.\n\nI find the NPR analysis superficial and misleading. We are meant to believe that these five white historians insufficiently advised the President on the problem of white supremacism. This appears incorrect, given the substance of Biden’s speech. In fact, out of the five historians, three are Jewish, one being the descendant of a Holocaust survivor. Jewish groups are at the forefront of warning about white nationalism and white identity. Jewish groups have historically been one of the most vocal and critical of all sorts of white identity movements.\n\nIf we are to care about the absence of black historians at the meeting, we should probably mention that “legacy white” Americans were surprisingly absent. Despite being more than 60% of America’s over-30 demographic (the lower range of anyone advising Biden), they made up only 40% of historians advising Biden. The plain white Americans, Christian white, gentile white, whatever you want to call them are thus not responsible for the under-representation of PoC historians. \n\nInstead, the 2% of the population who comprise America’s thriving Jewish community made up 60% of the advisors to Biden on the dangers of America, and influenced his anti white nationalism speech. This is a shocking over-representation on its face, but not too unusual in light of Biden’s cabinet and appointments, which are also disproportionately Jewish. If we are to care about over-representation, it seems we should start here. After all, the plain white community and the Jewish community do have different socioeconomic and historical aspects. It’s not like Jimmy the Italian from long island has access to the wealth of the Jewish community. \n\nAs [the Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/did-a-jewish-mafia-once-control-the-us-publishing-industry/amp/) reported recently, the Jewish community maintained a “mafia-like” influence on publishing since the 1940s, so the difference between the Jewish community and say the Italian community are real and substantive. This is to say, it’s true Jews are white, but they have historically comprised a unique and somewhat inclusive community with their own levers of influence. NPR castigating 100% of white people for the over-representation of a small subset of that community is unreasonable. And indeed, once Jewish over-representation is analyzed, we can move on to Irish Catholic over-representation, which is nowhere near as high as Jewish over-representation, but there to some degree.",

Am I just aging and want to consume things from my prime.\n\nI do notice in the past we had movies where male (usually white) battles world and sometimes personal demons.  Male wins.  I like those movies.  Last two days I’ve watched Jerry Maguire and Goodwill Hunting.  Women plays some emotional support role.  Some reason Man on Fire is coming to my head as a movie I like.  Black man has demons, proceeds to conquer them, saves white girl.\n\nPoint I’m getting to I believe is in the past all shows were basically man battles world.  Man triumphs while fighting his weaknesses.  I’m trying to come up with a theory for why all modern film sucks.  And I think it’s because I’m a misogynist.\n\nWoke films suck because deep down we all know men have to lead.  Goodwill Hunting had Matt Damon (the genius) having the trust fund Stanford med school girl begging him to be in love.  Sort of like Steve Jobs and his Stanford mba wife who never worked.\n\nThis stuff is just real.  World I grew up in men had to lead.  And it’s still the world I know in the business world.  When I struggle in business I lose interest in dating.  Who would want me if I’m a failure?\n\nMaybe I should embrace this non-patriarchal society though I think it’s against human nature and a reason why new media isn’t believable.  In my world if I don’t win then I don’t get the girl and I don’t deserve her.  In woke world world then I guess I get to be house husband.\n\nEdit:  Also own a lot of HBO stock because I thought they had the best content",

This is despite Kiwifarms having strict rules regarding threats and always issuing bans soon after violating posts are published. I’m reminded of when the Florida school shooter literally wrote on YouTube that he planned to carry out his attack, in no uncertain terms, weeks before his attack. Obviously, no one would argue that YouTube ought to be denied DDoS protection (effectively deplatformed) for this. importantly, this judgment by Cloudflare allows malicious actors to eradicate any unpopular discussion website they desire by writing threats using a VPN. The rule strikes me as an insane misjudgment, but then, I don’t think this is as simple as Cloudflare making a misjudgment. I think there may be political pressures behind the scenes, which would be even scarier than Cloudflare making a misjudgment.",

If these MAGA people are so extreme as he claims, wouldn't he want to encourage their antics so as to continually win general elections?\n\nIn places like Philippines or Hungary, the ruling party relishes putting their opposition to the margins, whereas Biden bizarrely wants to *help* the establishment of his opponent.\n\nThis is something that seems strangely and uniquely American. I can't think of any other country where the elite of one party tries desperately to help out the other party's establishment. In most other democracies, the ruling party just tries to consolidate its gains. \n\nAnd lest I be accused of only promoting right-wing populists (e.g. Orban or Duterte), you could look at Scandinavia from the 1950s-1970s for a left-wing equivalent. Those government had no compunction about stacking the odds as much as possible in their own favour.\n\nThe generous reading is that Biden's speech wasn't about winning but about \"saving democracy\" even if it means helping the GOP elite, because Biden is such a selfless patriot.\n\nA less generous reading would be that Biden is part of the same \"uniparty\" as Mitch McConnell and other GOP leaders who are terrified of being swallowed up alive by the forces that Trump ultimately represents however inperfectly. In this reading, Biden trying to bring down a rival faction to the GOP establishment isn't a selfless act of patriotism as much as naked self-interest.\n\nWhichever reading you prefer, it still remains notable that this type of behaviour is uncommon in other countries. Certainly, the US system seems to produce a unified political class much more unified than other countries.",

    "body": "Income Based Repayment is totally insane.\n\nPeople had pointed out that it was a reasonable part of the loan forgiveness. I had agreed. Now I think it is the worst, building a time bomb on purpose and refusing to disarm it.\n\nMaybe I am wrong. God I hope so. I laid out a lot of math below. *Part of the reason I wrote this was that someone could tell me where I messed up.* \n\n**Current regime**\n\nThe [current IBR rules](https://www.financialrounds.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-income-based-repayment-ibr/) are that you pay at most 10% of your discretionary income (which I abbreviate DI here). DI is your income past 150% of the [Federal Poverty Rate (FPR)](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/).\n\nIf I am a single guy, 150% of FPR is $20,385. If I earn $100K, my DI is about 80K, meaning I never have to pay more than 8K a year. If this is not enough to cover interest, that interest goes away. Even if it were getting capitalized into the balance, [any remaining balance is forgiven after 20 years](https://www.financialrounds.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-income-based-repayment-ibr/) so who cares.\n\n([It used to be 25 years under \"old IBR\" but now we are in \"new IBR\"](https://fcaa.org/student-loan-repayment-plans/income-based-repayment/) and I guess we are about to get \"new new IBR\".\n\n$8000 is a lot of post-tax spending, but what incentives does it make?\n\n(I am going to make up a 5% interest rate for loans; this should be checked and numbers below reviewed on it changing).\n\nIf I take out **$93,000 in loans**, standard amortization means I will spend $8000 a year over 20 years to pay it down to zero. That **is the break-even point**. Each aditional dollar I borrow means $1.08 that disappears at the end.\n\n$93,000 is a lot of debt. [Only 4% get over 56K](https://www.aplu.org/our-work/5-archived-projects/college-costs-tuition-and-financial-aid/publicuvalues/student-debt.html) and only 0.5% hit 100K. Average medical debt is $200,000 but my numbers were based on a salary of $100,000 which doctors will eclipse.\n\nWhat if I run a family of 4? At $100,000 my DI is $58,375. That drops all the above loan numbers by about 30%. **$68,000 is still a lot of loans** to take out.\n\nBut let us change the salary. Average salary for a college graduate is around $55,000. For the single guy, that is a DI of $35,000, meaning annual payments of $3500. This is a DI of 44% of the original value, meaning **the break-even is now $40,700**. About 20% of graduates hit this level, eyeballing the earlier aplu.org link. This is starting to become a serious moral hazard.\n\nFor a family of 4 the DI at $55,000 is only $13375. That **requires only $15,600 in debt**. I am not so much worried about financially supporting a family of 4 making $55,000 as I am in giving them a direct incentive to go as expensive as possible once loans hit $15,600.\n\n\n\n**Proposed Regime**\n\nThe [new program](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2022/08/26/the-new-income-driven-repayment-system-could-cause-some-big-problems/) has these relevant changes:\n\n* Increase the amount of income not subject to IDR from 150 percent of the federal poverty line to 225 percent of the federal poverty line.\n\n* Eliminate any accrual of interest on IDR-enrolled loans.\n\n* For undergraduate debt, reduce the IDR rate from 10 percent of income beyond the threshold in (1) to 5 percent of income beyond the threshold in (1).\n\nItems 1 and 3 directly change my math. I will get back to item 2 later.\n\nSo now our fresh-college-graduate-single-guy-making-$100,000 has a DI of (100000 - 13590 * 2.2) or $70,000 and annual payments of $3500. This means **the break-even point is now $40,700.** If he has (or will soon have) a family of 4 his DI is now just $38,950 and will pay no more than $1,950 per year. **Just $22,600 in loans is the break-even**, meaning there is no difference to him between borrowing $22,600 and $93,000. Might as well go into luxury student housing, move the family in.\n\nThat average college grad making $55,000 with a family of 4? Your DI is *less than zero*. In fact, **any income up to $61,050 means you do not have to pay a single cent towards your loans**, as the balance stays flat and the 20-year timer ticks away.\n\nItem 2 is missing from my analysis. If I read it right, as long as your income is below the IBR threshold, no money gets added, but in a lot of my above analysis that did not matter because uncapitalized interest vanished.\n\nI guess it matters if you think you will have many years of salad days and then suddenly earn a lot of money. If you could get an extra dollar in financial aid and put it in a crummy retail bank savings account, that would still be a good idea. Either 20 years hits and you get to keep all the money, or your income goes up and you withdraw the money from the savings account to pay it back.\n\nI want to make up a web calculator that shows the break-even point for given circumstances, but first I need to figure out how many mistakes I made above.",

    "body": "After Roe v. Wade was overturned, a common argument was to describe pro-life Republicans as \"the dog that caught the car\". There's some indication that this is true, as Republican political candidates are [slowly walking away from strict abortion bans](https://reason.com/2022/08/30/republicans-supported-abortion-bans-for-decades-now-theyve-gone-silent/).\n\nI was obviously aware of the conservative stance on this topic but truthfully I never took it seriously. Because *Roe* had been a question answered on constitutional grounds, it meant no one could do anything about it short of a constitutional amendment that had no chance of passing. Which meant that advocates could jawbone all they want about wanting to ban abortions without ever having to be made to call their bluff. Blake Masters, Senate candidate in Arizona, used to support a national ban on abortion. But recently, he accused his opponent of mischaracterizing his position, and claims that he's only opposed to \"very late-term and partial-birth abortion\". His campaign website was modified to reflect this new position. Bailey, meet Motte.\n\nI noticed a similar reaction when stories like the 10-year-old rape victim in Ohio popped up. If you said you wanted to ban all abortions no questions asked, you necessarily had to support legally forcing that 10-year-old girl to carry to term. That also necessarily means prosecuting anyone who hinders that prohibition (doctors, pharmacists, anyone who facilitates inter-state travel, etc.) [through the typical avenues](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/10/people-literally-do-not-understand-what-laws-are-or-how-they-work), which means people with guns and badges threatening to put people in cages.\n\nThere's an easy way to square this circle. If you genuinely believe that abortion is as immoral as murder (without exception) and that the law should reflect that, then you have to support forcing 10-year-old rape victims into carrying their pregnancy to term. This is plainly justified even by conceding that forcing a child to carry her rapist's baby is atrocious, because the rejoinder would be terminating that fetus' life is an even bigger atrocity. I disagree strongly with those premises (a position I suspect is widely shared), but I at least genuinely respect their consistency. Now that *Roe* is gone, we get to see how many people are willing to grab the dilemma bull by the horns.",

I mean this guy literally said an election was corrupted solely because he lost. his supporters have also demonstrated a willingness to back Trump's interest with violence. based on their stances, what underlying principles can possibly be said to undergird trump or his supporters' stances? at a certain point we have to b able to recognize something for what it is. and I've also heard that republicans are starting to distance themselves from trump after the revelations of the past month, so the timing of this could end up being fairly astute on biden's part.",

There was some [interesting imagery](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fbnb-x5XwAA1LB2?format=jpg&amp;name=medium) from it, although I'm not really a fan of these sorts of photos.  Also somewhat hilariously CNN tried [edit the hue of the stream](https://twitter.com/MiaCathell/status/1565533698795208704) in the middle of the speech, apparently to make it look less sinister.\n\nMy thoughts on the speech: I like the *surface version* of some parts of what biden is saying here.  Or maybe a better way to say that is: I like the character he is pretending to play.\n\nWhere this goes off the rails for me is: he's basically saying that almost half of the country is a threat to not just his power, but to democracy *itself*.  He goes on and on about how incredible our nation is (something I agree with), how important our ideals of democracy and free speech are (something I also agree with), but then goes on to say that \"MAGA\" is a threat to all of this.  Of course this is probably a performance for his followers, and of course this likely isn't going to move anybody in the direction of supporting him.  Maybe this will rile up his base?\n\nMy frustration with everything is: where does this supposedly lead?  If Biden loses power in November, and is removed from office either on or before january 2025, will he \"go peacefully\"?  Will there be riots?  Will more cities burn?  What happens when he loses an election in 2024?  I certainly don't think any of his followers will simply accept it and congratulate Trump or Desantis or anybody else.\n\nMy other frustration is: what biden is pretending to say here is actually really important.  We actually, truly, need somebody to unite the nation.  Here is what I wish he would do, and think this would make him go down as one of the best presidents in our nations history:\n\n* Blanket pardon for anybody involved in January 6th\n\n* Blanket pardon for anybody involved in summer 2020 rioting\n\n* Blanket pardon for Donald Trump, his family, and anybody related to his campaign WRT anything tax or document related, or anything else that the democratic machine has been running for the last 5 years.\n\n* Support a \"MAGA republican\" led committee to spend as much time as they want chasing down every conspiracy theory related to election fraud that they want, and encourage the courts to cooperate.  Televise it.\n\nIf Biden did this, it would take most of the wind out of the sails of these MAGA republicans, and it would solidify his win in 2024.  The thing fueling those MAGA republicans *is* them feeling like they have absolutely no voice in government right now, and seeing a president that they feel is invalid get in front of a scary red brick background and give an angry speech about how they aren't really valid as Americans certainly doesn't make them feel any better.\n\nJust saying: \"okay, I'll listen to you.\" would go a long, long, long way to reestablishing some trust *and* I think it would give him what he wants.\n\nUnfortunately I doubt this will happen.

In the case of contention, what those similarities are is also likely to come under contention. Many of the metaphors on here turn into argument over the technicalities of the metaphor rather than the object-level issue. \n\nThat has a lot to do with the type of audience you get here, but it still illustrates that metaphors themselves can conceal as much as they reveal.

    "body": "If we had the technology to actually change genders where you couldn't tell the difference between a woman/man born the wrong gender and an actual person born of that gender would you support it?\n\nI think it would change my mind. I personally don't have a problem with the idea of people being transgender. My biggest problem with it is I think we don't have the technology to actually do what is being promised and the surgery/transitioning is cruel to vulnerable people. All you have to do is go on /b or /pol to see the results to see that this is not a settled scientific process. I know it sounds gross, but seeing the results of these surgeries just makes me sick to my stomach. And then you have the child side where kids who aren't even fully developed emotionally/physically getting life changing surgery that can't be reversed. This is what bothers me the most.\n\nI truly think we will look back on this time the same as we do with lobotomies. It feels like we are doing experimental surgery on vulnerable people who would be better off staying their assigned gender. That's my argument against this current (what I consider) madness.\n\nI feel that most people agree with me here. However, if transitioning was actually possible, would you change your mind? To me, it makes the debate over. If you can safely and effectively transition people, what is the downside?\n\nEdit: On the 4chan part, I was being glib there. The point I was trying to make is that we only see bad results. With how aggressive the trans lobby is, if they were actually the same in how they looked, people would be saying look it's indistinguishable. That fact that we don't see this shows they know it looks unnatural and would be off-putting to most people if they actually saw the results. I’ve never seen a trans person pass irl. If they can’t make a person pass, there’s no way they can make a passing sex organ. The only people I've seen pass (and only online) are people who didn't go through puberty as the opposite sex. But that would basically mean we'd have to transition children, which I am pretty skeptical of.",

    "body": "**Biological Sex without Teleology**\n\nAre a bird's wings \"for\" flying?\n\nFrom a metaphysical naturalist understanding of modern biology, the answer has to be no. \"For\" implies a purpose, and purpose belongs to agents.\n\nAn airplane's wings are for flying - the intentions of engineers ensure that. But birds had no creator, no agent involved in their existence. We might be able to metaphorically talk about a bird being \"designed\" or \"built\" for flight, but it is only that: a metaphor.\n\nIf we want to limit our description to what can be described based on an physico-empirical view of reality, then a bird's wing's **make flight possible** or **allow them to fly**, but we can't speak about a bird's wings being \"for\" anything at all.\n\nSo too with the word \"need.\"\n\nDoes a seed \"need\" water and sunlight and nutrient rich soil? A metaphysical naturalist would say no. \"Need\" implies that there's some sort of goal, or right way for a seed to be, but the universe doesn't care if a seed dies or grows into a giant tree over many eons.\n\nHumans trying to grow seeds might \"need\" water, and fertilizer and a location with the right amount of sun in order to fulfill that goal, but regarding the seed itself we can only make predictions about the outcomes of different conditions on the seed.\n\nIf the seed experiences Scenario A (X units of water delivered at intervals Y, Z units of soil of composition W, V hours of average daily sun exposure, etc.) then it will grow into a big tree, but if the seed experiences Scenario B (no water, no sun, no soil) it will stay a seed and die, with a thousand possible predictions branching off from these two.\n\nSo what do we make of \"sex\" from this standpoint?\n\nI think the radical thing that this line of thinking implies is to stop thinking about \"man\" and \"woman\" as some sort of natural pairing.\n\nJust as there are seeds, and we can make predictions about what effects particular conditions will have on the seed, so too there are animals and we can make predictions about what effects particular conditions will have on those animals.\n\nIf the gamete of animal A finds its way to the gamete of animal B, we might get a zygote, or we might get nothing at all depending on the particular animals involved and the particular gametes.\n\nThings start to come down to categoricity and disciplined pattern formation.\n\nIs a penis \"for\" a vagina? Is an ovum \"for\" a sperm? Do men and women have some sort of complimentary relationship?\n\nIt is almost certain that humans come pre-installed with social hardware that predisposes them to think of human males and human females as belonging to one type or category in some sense - the human. But if we pull back the curtains, we can see an equally valid way of slicing up reality: men and women are different but \"related\" things.\n\nMen and women rely on each other to reproduce their own kind. Men can't make more of themselves without women, and women can't make more of themselves without men. But why think of them as part of one \"species\" or \"type\"? Sure, they share a lot of similarities, and can be contrasted against things like \"rabbits\" as a whole, even as one can draw parallels between \"human males\" and \"rabbit males.\"\n\nI believe it was Bret Weinstein who said that if alien biologists came down to Earth, they would rediscover the concept of sex every day. I don't exactly take issue with this claim, but I do wonder if the aliens would have the encyclopedia entry \"Humans\", or if there would be two encyclopedia entries \"[Human-Male]\" and \"[Human-Female].\"\n\nThere's one layer deeper to go here, though. Would the alien biologists even stop there? How would they deal with intersex individuals?\n\nI think a certain form of so-called \"binary\" thinking is to talk about there being men and women, with intersex individuals being deviations from the norm that can still be forced into one of those two boxes, or filed away into a \"freak of nature\" box (though we would never call it that with modern social mores.)\n\nBut I think this \"binary\" thinking has exactly the same problem that \"needs\"- or \"for\"-based thinking produces: it engages in teleological thinking.\n\nWe could imagine that instead of having abstractions at the level of \"man\" and woman\" that the alien biologists have a unique compound word for everything that basically contains every bit of information about that thing known to the aliens.\n\nAt this level, maybe the alien biologists could notice patterns between two things, which for us would become categories, but for them remain unabstracted, ungeneralized observations about the entirety of existing things. Maybe these aliens don't even have the concept of \"distinct things\" but instead build up observations from correlations of raw sensory data that doesn't get processed by modules in their brain into \"objects\" and \"animals\" and \"things\", but instead is dealt with as a Unity with sub-patterns within patterns that can be interacted with and about which predictions can be made.\n\nI think our brain modules do a lot of work in making certain \"categories\" seem more plausible than others, that is the source of the shadow of teleology projected back out into the world. However, once we see past the shadow, it might genuinely become impossible to pick a point to stop cutting reality at the joints.",

Cloudflare had previously terminated services to The Daily Stormer and 8chan, but this time the company says it will take no action, and even suggest the previous deplatformings were a mistake.\n\nSelected quotes:\n\n&gt;Some argue that we should terminate these services to content we find reprehensible so that others can launch attacks to knock it offline. That is the equivalent argument in the physical world that the fire department shouldn't respond to fires in the homes of people who do not possess sufficient moral character. Both in the physical world and online, that is a dangerous precedent, and one that is over the long term most likely to disproportionately harm vulnerable and marginalized communities.\n\n&gt;[...]\n\n&gt;Just as the telephone company doesn't terminate your line if you say awful, racist, bigoted things, we have concluded in consultation with politicians, policy makers, and experts that turning off security services because we think what you publish is despicable is the wrong policy. To be clear, just because we did it in a limited set of cases before doesn’t mean we were right when we did. Or that we will ever do it again.\n\n&gt;[...]\n\n&gt;We do, however, believe that in cases where our values are diametrically opposed to a paying customer that we should take further steps to not only not profit from the customer, but to use any proceeds to further our companies’ values and oppose theirs.\n\n&gt;For instance, when a site that opposed LGBTQ+ rights signed up for a paid version of DDoS mitigation service we worked with our Proudflare employee resource group to identify an organization that supported LGBTQ+ rights and donate 100 percent of the fees for our services to them.

    "body": "So, fellow Europoors, what's the status of the electricity/cost-of-living crisis in your hoods?\n\nFinland is getting hit less than Central Europe, but getting hit nevertheless. We haven't been \\*quite\\* as dependent on Russian power than many other countries - Russian gas was only 5 % of the energy supply, Russians cut the flow already back in May, and in general Russian electricity imports have formed 10 % of the Finnish electricity use. However, prices are still expected to rise very high in the winter, naturally the season when the society most needs electricity and has to import it.\n\nThe crisis is particularly - as everywhere else - hitting those living in detached housing. Even though district heating and, lately, geothermal are increasingly popular for heating, and an increasing amoung of air-source heat pumps have been installed there's still a lot of them relying on direct electric heating, which on current terms translates to \"pay up the nose\". Such houses might well see electricity bills hitting well over a thousand a month, unless nothing is done.\n\nAmong various issues:\n\n\\- Nordic electricity generation is reliant on water power, and though the Nordic countries haven't seen droughts on the Central European level, these are still affecting water power generation. Finland has imported electricity from Norway, and now the Norwegians are mulling restricting [electricity exports](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/22095-lintilae-norway-restricting-electricity-exports-would-play-into-putin-s-hands.html).\n\n\\- There would still be a chance to avoid the worst of it - if the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear generator goes fully online before the schedule, or at least is not delayed any more. Olkiluoto 3 has been the white whale of nuclear projects for years now, incredibly delayed and costly project that is now in test use, with those tests also frequently facing unplanned downtimes. The current estimate for Olkiluoto 3 finally starting commercial use is December 2022, but we'll see. In particular having OL3 being online and without issues would lead to stability - less need to worry about whether winter's particularly cold and how windy/sunny it is for renewables.\n\n\\- While browsing Twitter, I've seen a fair amount of what can only be described as 'schadenfreude' by pro-Russian right-wingers in various countries mocking Europeans with high energy bills and Ukraine flags in the profile photo. There's next to none of that here, as the entire Finnish society continues to be broadly pro-Ukrainian. I haven't seen any major political actors suggesting trying to make nice with Russia as a solution, of course it would be hard to do that by our lonesome anyway as long as we're a part of the EU, and Russians might tell us to pound sand anyway.\n\n\\- The environmental aspect is, of course, a big local culture war, especially in a country where much (most?) of the culture war has been environmentalism-related for a long time. It's not an easy question, non-/anti-environmentalists say that of course when you do things to drive up the costs of polluting the prices of electricity (which cannot really be produced in any way without \\*some\\* pollution) environmentalists claim that without the environmental measures the situation would be worse, comparing us to Britain where the junking of \"green crap\" led to end to insulation efforts or to countries that are more dependent on fossil fuels than us.\n\n\\- There's a back-up power reserve including, among others, Finland's last electricity-generation-oriented coal plant (other coal plants mainly generate heat). It's pretty certain that if it comes to firing up the power reserve or rolling blackouts, the power reserve is going to be fired up - that's what reserves are for, after all - but there are calls to do this already at this point with the electric bills going up, and apparently there are difficulties related to this, such as the fact that the said coal plant would need some heavy maintenance to bring back up.\n\n\\- much of the price rise is caused by market issues, Finland being a part of the European electric grid and thus being affected by the comparatively larger issues of the other countries, the sheer uncertainty of the situation hiking up the futures, and so on. Of course, if nations like Norway restrict exports, there's just going to be a domino effect with it being easier and easier for other nations to do the same when necessity calls. It's hard to see these sorts of crises as anything less than further evidence in the breakdown of globalization, unless it alternatively finally becomes the crisis the European elites can use to enact the European federation.\n\nThe government is planning measures to alleviate the crisis. Currently, the news are reporting that they're considering a measure for a tax rebate on bills over 500€ / month and a cut on the electricity VAT, as well as some less defined measure to help the poorest families and some throw-ins like doubled child benefits etc.\n\nTo me, this seems counterproductive - like tailormade to help the most energy-consumptive housing and the least-well off, but leaving large urban middle classes living in flats or in less-consumptive detached housing with only the VAT benefit. If we want to actually avoid rolling blackouts, and unless there's some measures that will lead to a lot of new electricity fast, it would seem we'd need to find some ways to reduce electricity use while ensuring that this won't break family budgets. That might mean models like guaranteeing a certain fixed price for electricity use under some ceiling and leaving market prices in force above that.",
