And probably a potent line of attack for the right. I feel that the left will be easily baited in not putting an upper bound and the extreme right is already at 0 so it is already priced in so to say.\n\nBtw my google fu seems to have failed me since I didn't manage to find a graph for distribution per number of abortions per woman for women that get them. If there happens to be a cohort of women with quite high number - this could make them a very soft and hard to defend target.\n\nFor me - the max number should be around 2-3 so women can have out in a critical periods of their life  - \"I was young and stupid\", \"I am too old for that shit\", \"The universe really hates me, just not now\"",

Aristocrats were protected from the force of social judgment by their rank and the economic security of their landed inheritance. With literacy rates high enough to guarantee mass participation in politics, social ranks level enough to preclude aristocratic deference, and wealth spread widely enough to instill an anxious spirit of bourgeoisie striving, America would never favor the heterodox. It never has.\n\n&gt;If cancel culture has always been with us, what has changed over time is what an American can be cancelled for. Twenty years ago, country music bands were being cancelled for opposing the Iraq War and writers were being cancelled for refusing to put American flags on their doorstep. Today, a different set of offenses leads to ostracization, but the forms and consequences of ostracization are largely the same. The current moment feels so fraught not because cancellation has emerged as a new feature in American life but because of the sudden and dramatic shift in the range of views deemed cancel-worthy. For the first time in their lives, many Americans find themselves on the wrong side of Tocqueville’s circle. This shift is especially disorienting for centrists whose views had—for most of their lives—constituted the very definition of acceptable opinion.\n\nThe essay is making a broader point, but I thought this part was particularly relevant to this subreddit for hopefully obvious reasons.",

    "body": "**How does someone come to the conclusion that they are transgendered?**\n\nI'm fairly liberal in the freedom sense living in a very blue tribe area with very blue tribe loved ones. Most of these loved ones are very on board with the trans movements and I would desperately like to agree with them. I have read much and believe I understand where most of the big differences between conservatives, gender critical feminists, trans medicalists and gender affirming approaches to the broad subject. I do think each of these different contingents have their own kernel of truth but none of them really seems to by itself describe reality as I see it. \n\nThis post is about self identification or how someone answers the self directed form of the infamous question \"what is a woman\", that is \"Am I a woman?\" in their own head and my dissatisfaction with how all of the above factions approach it but mostly the gender affirming camp as they're the ones I'm most consistently in disharmony with in my day to day life. \n\nWhen I truly try to put myself in the shoes of a young person attempting to tackle the question \"am I a woman\" I am presented with a couple interlocking challenges. \n\n1. The actual definition of what a woman is\n\nFor the conservatives and gender critical crowd this is fairly straightforward. It's a matter of what set of genitals you were born with and the rare exceptions where there are defects are to be handled on a case by case basis. \n\nTrans medicalists are defined pretty much exactly by their difference to the gender affirming camp by having a straight forward answer to this question but in doing so excluding some people. A Woman is either a female who does not experience some form of Body Integrity Dysphoria relating to sexual traits or a male who does. \n\nThe gender affirming camp tends to approach this question in a lot of ways but they tend to boil down to a \"woman is someone who believes they're a woman\" and my problem with this definition and nearly all other formulations is what inspired this post and \n\n\\2. How can I, with my single point of perspective determine whether I fit in this definition.\n\nFor conservatives and gender critical feminists this and the next part are quite easy. You appeal to your physical characteristics and in the very rare edge cases(intersex and similar situations) where this is not obvious you appeal to the community to find the most natural solution expecting grace from those around you on the subject.\n\nFor trans medicalists this is also fairly straightforward. If you experience strong dysphoria relating to your sexual characteristics then you are trans.\n\n**Now the big one and the meat of this post.** How can someone armed only with the circular self identification definition actually evaluate if they are a woman? We're each only endowed with one first person experience and are unable to directly access the experience of a member of the opposite sex to compare and contrast our internal experience. There is no binary light in my head when I close my eyes that glows blue, no proof to myself that I am a man and no proof that I am not a woman. I can't possibly distinguish between the internal states \"I am a man(assigned male at birth) that incorrectly suspects I am actually a woman\" and \"I am a woman(assigned male at birth) who correctly suspects that I am a woman\". With the total absence of proof, as this imagined child grappling with the question, I'm terrified of the possibility of getting it wrong. \n\n\\3. given that I am or am not a woman what do I do?\n\nThis is where the conservatives and gender critical feminists diverge radically. Conservatives expect women to lean into the traditional stereotypes while gender critical feminists consider those stereotypes harmful. And the trans medicalists and gender affirmation camps recombine to strangely enough agree widely with the conservatives on the stereotypes but just not the populations to apply them to. \n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'd be grateful to anyone who can convince me that there isn't a huge problem here with the gender affirming approach because it would be far less stressful to be in dissonance with so many around me. I want to be convinced but not at the cost of not strongly believing the solution is correct. Feel free to also correct me if my modeling of how the other groups answer these questions seems wrong to you, in particular I think the conservative camp is probably very low resolution here.",

    "body": "**Abortions and Vaccines: Why the Correlation?**\n\nIf you're in favor of legal abortion, you tend to be in favor of covid vaccines.  If you're against legal abortion, you tend to be against covid vaccines.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm asking you.\n\nI will use \"pro-abortion\" to refer to the position that abortion should be legal and \"anti-abortion\" to refer to the position that abortion should not be legal.  I will use \"pro-vaccine\" and \"anti-vaccine\" a little more vaguely, but hopefully not too vaguely.  \"Pro-vaccine\" will refer to a spectrum of pro-vaccine attitudes, from \"it's really important that everyone get vaccinated and boosted\" up to and including legal mandates requiring vaccines to enter public businesses, the workplace, etc.  \"Anti-vaccine\" is the negation of this position.\n\nIf you tend to be pro- one of these things, you tend to be pro- the other.  Likewise if you are anti- one of these things, you tend to be anti- the other.  I find this to be curious, since it's hard to find a single unifying moral principle that entails both positions.\n\nFrequently, debates over both abortions and vaccines are cast in terms of bodily autonomy.  \"You can't (force me to get a vaccine || force me to carry a fetus I don't want) because it violates my bodily autonomy\".  If this was actually the key underlying principle at stake, then you would expect that people who are persuaded by the argument from autonomy in one case would be persuaded by it in the other, and we would see a significant contingent of people lining up in support of the pro-abortion-anti-vaccine position.  But this actually turns out to be a relatively rare combination of positions.\n\nFull disclosure: I am both pro-abortion and anti-vaccine, because I take the argument from autonomy seriously in both cases.  However, I also feel that abortion is a more ethically complicated issue than vaccine mandates, which fits with the general observation that there is some underlying shared assumption or psychological trait that tends to pull anti-vaccine people towards being anti-abortion, and vice versa.\n\nI don't feel like I need to provide much evidence in support of the thesis that there is a correlation between the pro-abortion and pro-vaccine positions.  It's pretty obvious to me.  Check any leftist discussion forum or news source and see what they have to say about both abortions and covid vaccines.\n\nThe correlation between the anti-abortion and anti-vaccine positions may not be quite as obvious, but I'm still confident it exists.  Consider, for example, that of the [seven states which brought a lawsuit](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/courts/2021/11/05/ohio-ag-sues-again-try-stopping-bidens-vaccine-mandate-osha-coronavirus-covid-19-white-house-yost/6301706001/) against OSHA's covid vaccine mandate (Ohio, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia), six of them (all but Kansas) are planning to [introduce significant abortion restrictions or outright bans](https://reproductiverights.org/maps/abortion-laws-by-state/) in the wake of the Roe decision.  I take this fact to be reflective of the general anti-abortion, anti-vaccine attitudes of the people who live in those states.\n\nSo.  Why do we observe a correlation between these particular positions?  Like I said at the outset, I don't know.  I'm mainly just opening the floor for discussion.  I'd like to get input from others here and hear what your ideas are.  However, I can briefly outline what *forms* a potential answer might take:\n\n**Shared underlying moral principle** - perhaps I've simply overlooked something, and there is in fact an underlying abstract principle that allows one to reason to both the anti-abortion and anti-vaccine position simultaneously, or vice versa.  I don't think it's going to be \"autonomy\".  Even though everyone will acknowledge that autonomy is ultimately defeasible, and I acknowledge that someone could support a very strong principle of autonomy while also being anti-abortion and anti-vaccine (\"I support your right do you what you want, but the fetus is a person with moral worth, and you simply don't have the right to kill another person\"), I simply don't think that autonomy is actually what's at stake for most people, based on listening to public discourse.  This is particularly evident in the pro-abortion-pro-vaccine camp, where arguments from autonomy against covid vaccines are given essentially no weight at all.\n\nOne idea I've been toying with is the idea of, not exactly an underlying formal principle, but the idea of an underlying \"aesthetic\" that could motivate the set of one's positions.  Perhaps rightists think that both abortions and covid vaccines represent the intrusion of the medical establishment into a natural, potentially even sacred domain that should instead be allowed to take its natural course, and it is opposition to this intrusion that motivates the anti-abortion-anti-vaccine position above all else.  Leftists could be motivated by an opposite impulse where they are fundamentally more sympathetic to humanity's attempts to control its own biology and environment through technological intervention.\n\n**Shared underlying interest**: Of course, not all political beliefs are arrived at through abstract reasoning, or even adherence to deeper unconscious principles.  Sometimes they're simply opportunistic.  The type of person who supports abortion, for example, might see vaccine mandates as a convenient way to penalize the class of people who is unlikely to support their broader social agenda.  \"If you wouldn't get a vaccine then you're probably a shitty person anyway, and now your shittiness is recorded for all the world to see in your digital vaccine passport\".\n\n**Group psychology**: Maybe people on the right are anti-abortion-anti-vaccine because That's Just What People On The Right Do, and vice versa.  On this model of political psychology, people join a team, they see what their team believes, and then they go believe that.  I think there's *something* to this idea, but I certainly don't think it can tell the full story.  There are too many observable patterns in how people think and reason, and it's not plausible to think that all political reasoning is nothing more than a meaningless epiphenomenon of group identity.",

The death of someone surrounded by friends, family, parents, children and so on, all of whom will be deeply sad at their passing clearly causes more harm, more pain and so on to others (namely those people) than the death of a friendless, childless, single orphan. \n\nThe moral harm of someone's death to their loved ones is central to our conception of the value of life. When a young parent dies, we mourn for their children who will grow up without them. Other than young children we feel sorriest, at funerals, for widows and widowers, not for the deceased who is either gone or (hopefully) in a happier place. In any cliche scene in which someone in a film is begging for their life, what do they say? \"I have a family\", \"think of my children\", \"my daughter needs me\", \"I have to look after my sick father\" blah blah blah. It's not \"I'd really want to live so I can spend another thirty years enjoying chicken parmigiana and watching the baseball on the weekend\", even if that actually sounds pretty good and even if our reasons to want to live *personally* are typically largely selfish.

    "body": "*New York Magazine* published [this](https://www.thecut.com/2022/07/harvey-weinstein-biography-body-shame.html) tabloid revelation. TLDR: Weinstein had weird deformed genitals, possibly as a result of gangrene[!] which may have lead to amputation of both testicles[!!!]. He also may have been severely impotent, requiring pre-coital injections to maintain an erection. Reportedly the jury saw photos of his genital region during the trial [to confirm testimony], and were visibly disgusted.\n\nI'm torn on the reporting of this and the framing of it as an explanatory factor in his actions. It's tempting to frame him as a sad man. \"Hurt people hurt people.\" People reach for these explanations to offer themselves a measure of control. It's not that rape is a fairly expected outcome of giving men that kind of power and failing to restrain it through social or legal means, or alternatively that we have to cope with the presence of certain evil men in our society, instead it shuffles blame into a nebulous idea that by a series of accidents sometimes there's a fat guy with a mean mom who loses his genitals in a freak and happens to have a lot of power over a lot of beautiful women. But that series of accidents isn't really preventable, it's just the universe, man.\n\nAnd it has little explanatory power. Ok Weinstein had weird junk, did Lauer, did Epstein, did Prince Andrew, did Deshaun Watson? Or do they all get their own little just-so story that explains their behavior? When do we come around to actually confronting human nature as it exists rather than blaming the dark sides of it on aberrant chances?\n\nI almost find myself wishing this information hadn't been published, because it retards progress on understanding rape in our society. It is clearly not the action of a psychotic minority of men, but a predilection that lurks within a significant minority of men and must be managed and prevented by policy and personal choices. Our society has this annoying tendency to say that we understand that anyone might be tempted to steal or kill, but only a sick man would think of rape. Then be shocked when so many men engage in pushing the boundaries of consent. \n\nThe piece tries to take that stance, talking about how it is important to see rapists as people not as monsters. I'd say talking about how his balls rotted off renders him more rather than less monstrous and inhuman and unusual. Less relatable, less normal. We need to confront the fact that there is no just-so story and no magic trick to preventing rape, that it is no different than preventing most crimes which people want to commit.",

My main point is that I think the argument over definitions is a distraction from more productive discussions.\n\nExcerpt: \n\nDebates over definition boundaries can be a fun conversational frivolity (Are Pop-Tarts a [sandwich](https://twitter.com/matttomic/status/859117370455060481)? Are Algerians [Latino](https://www.reddit.com/r/LatinoPeopleTwitter/comments/nxhiet/latino_alignment_chart/)? Is *Old Town Road* country music? Etc.) but they’re most often deployed with other goals in mind. Arguments over definitions are often disguised queries for something else entirely. In [Yudkowsky’s example](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4FcxgdvdQP45D6Skg/disguised-queries), a factory worker is tasked with sorting blue furry egg-shaped objects (called “bleggs”) from smooth red cubic objects (“rubes”) on an assembly line. This job goes fine until the worker encounters a purple egg and has no idea how to sort it. The worker and his supervisor get distracted by the debate over definitions (Can bleggs be purple? Can rubes be furry?) until the *true* purpose of the sorting job gets revealed: bleggs contain vanadium ore, and rubes contain palladium ore, both of which need to be industrially processed differently. The ore processing plants do not give a fuck what color or shape their supply chain materials are so long as they accomplish the purpose they were built for. The question “Is this a rube or a blegg?” therefore is used as a good enough (and presumably cheaper) way of solving the ultimate (and presumably more complicated) logistical question of “Does this need to be processed by the palladium or the vanadium plant?”. But without a shared understanding from both parties for *why* the distinction matters, no answer will communicate any useful information to whoever is asking. It’ll remain a useless question.\n\nSimilarly, [if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7X2j8HAkWdmMoS8PE/disputing-definitions), does it make a *sound*? Another useless question. Both yes and no can be correct answers, depending entirely on whether your definition of sound is “acoustic vibrations” or “perceived auditory sensation”. Without first establishing *why* the distinction between the two definitions matters, no useful response is possible. Here too it’s possible to get infinitely distracted over which definition is the “correct” one, but the purpose of language ultimately is communication, and the more productive avenue would be to acknowledge that it’s helpful for distinct concepts to have distinct words. You can even make up new words (alberzle and bargulum for example) to avoid future confusion.\n\nSometimes ambiguity is intentional. Was [January 6th](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/the-january-6th-circus) an insurrection? Again, that depends entirely on *why* the distinction matters. The reason this might matter to a federal prosecutor would be maybe to determine whether they should file criminal charges under [18 U.S.C. §2383](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2383). But outside of that niche analysis, it’s reasonable to be suspicious of questions like this because of the serious negative connotations that *insurrection* inevitably conjures up. The question is very likely intended as a cover to ask “Was January 6th a Very Bad Thing™?”. Whoever asking the question then would have an interest *against* establishing a shared understanding for *why* the distinction matters. Because the goal with dishonest questions like is to score points, not gain information.\n\nI am not the first to notice this deceptive practice. Parrhesia wrote about [the word games used](https://parrhesia.substack.com/p/playing-word-games-with-the-woke) in these types of discussions, most blatantly with the word *racism*. In terms of heavyweight champions in the semantic space, *racism* is a sought-after bruiser. It’s a strong word with serious negative connotations, and everyone is eager to use it to bludgeon their opponents. Asking whether something is or isn’t racist is the mother of all disguised queries. The goal here isn’t to gain information, it’s to find out who to bludgeon.",

If you say that it's not ok to kill them and/or it is necessary to render aid given their helpless state, what is it that makes them a human person to you? \n- Is it that they resemble you physically in some respect?\n- Is it that they will soon regain the abilities that you think define personhood?\n- Is it that they once experienced the abilities that you think define personhood even if there's no conscious continuity?  \n- Something else?\n\nEdit:\n\nA recurring question is what the coma process is like, so to clarify:\n\nThe brain is reformatting itself, this is a process that is uninterruptible and will take a long period of time. During this time the brain is not having what we would consider thoughts or experiences, though there is some sort of electrical activity. Electrical activity closer to 8 weeks of gestation than 40 weeks of gestation.  The subject is not light sensitive and not forming memories, for instance.  This process is happening on its own and is certain to complete itself in two weeks as long as the body is kept hydrated.\n\nI also really don't want to talk about abortion.  Even talking about zygotes/embryos has been getting off topic.  I want to identify what a human person is and how that is different from a living human organism for most Motte people.\n\nSo far, the answer I'm getting is a certain amount of gray matter, though it doesn't depend on if it's forming a thought.",

    "body": "Yglesias: [How Hillary Clinton unleashed the Great Awokening](https://www.slowboring.com/p/how-hillary-clinton-unleashed-the)\n\n&gt;Part of the issue here is that Democrats have consistently chosen to interpret the fact that Trump is a scumbag as indicating that Trump is an ideological extremist, when these are just different questions. But I think in some ways the bigger and more unconsidered issues have to do with how the 2016 primaries played out. In particular, Clinton got spooked by Bernie Sanders’ stronger-than-expected early showing and decided to respond by outflanking him to the left on social issues. I believe that this backfired and caused Sanders to do better with moderate Democrats than he otherwise would have done and also bolstered his popularity with the general electorate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But both Clinton and Sanders seemingly believed that her efforts in this regard were highly effective.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After the primaries, the Sanders team decided they needed to outflank the establishment by moving even further left on identity issues, and the establishment decided that front-loading identity issues was their ticket to holding an incipient socialist takeover at bay. So while the question in the 2016 primary was something like, “should we move left on identity or on economics?” the answer ended up being, “let’s do both.”\n\nI think this comports with what I observed following, for instance, various Sanders groups in 2016. Sanders started by having, genuinely a bunch of fans who can be described as \"Bernie bros\" and didn't have particularly woke views on social issues, even if they probably could be described as generic liberals. Polls showed that Bernie had fans among \\*both\\* left-wing and moderate Democrats, and served, to some degree at least, as a general stop-Hillary, throw-the-bums-out candidate in the primary; Yglesias fingers Iraq War as the big issue which lessened Hillary's popularity. Pretty soon Hillary team responded by highlighting social issues (the \"Would that end racism?\") speech and, upon losing, Sanders team decided that they must outflank this outflanking in 2020, contributing to a purity spiral.\n\nThe title might be wrong, some have stated that the beginning of the \"awokening\" is in 2012-2013 with Trayvon Martin case and so on, but this doesn't necessarily conflict with the idea that the 2016 Democratic primary is also a pivotal movement - the 2012-2013 period might have well created the necessary preconditions for the dynamic where the most natural reaction to a challenge is generally trying to outflank the challenger from the left on social issues.",

    "body": "[The Case Against Judicial Review](https://prospect.org/justice/the-case-against-judicial-review)\n\nJudicial review, first implemented in Marbury v Madison, is the basis of the powers traditionally held by the Supreme Court. This article goes over the history of it, but I can't get over the slant. It reads like nothing more nor less than sour grapes. Judicial review is bad because it is leading to bad outcomes today, right now. Starting from the end of the article:\n\n&gt;Under any government, there is always a danger of its power being abused. Democratically elected legislatures are not immune from this problem. It must be admitted that, should Republicans take control of Congress and the White House without any constraint from the Court, there’s a strong chance they’d pass all manner of abusive stuff. The Florida legislature, for example, recently passed a bigoted “don’t say gay” bill that blatantly violates the civil rights of LGBT teachers.\n\n&gt;But the risk of theoretically unconstrained congressional majorities must be set against the current fact of the Court steadily stealing the powers of Congress, eroding the freedom of the people—and, of course, doing nothing to protect gay Florida teachers from a feral state legislature. It’s far from the first time American courts have ignored the Bill of Rights, and it won’t be the last.\n\nBad outcomes, therefore judicial review is bad now, and while it could be worse in the future, we have to do something now.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n&gt;A current or future president, in response to some particularly egregious Supreme Court diktat, would explain their problems with the ruling, and insist that they will not obey the decision. They would say that in their opinion, Marbury v. Madison was wrongly decided, that the Court does not get to claim sole power to interpret the Constitution, and that the Constitution has no stipulation about the U.S. being a judicial dictatorship. From now on, if Congress, for example, directs the president to regulate air pollution, then they will do as instructed, rather than obeying the Court’s wishes.\n\nOf course, we have had prior Presidents who have done exactly this! And what does the article have to say about Old Hickory?\n\n&gt;While challenging the judiciary is commonly associated with Andrew Jackson, the two best presidents in history, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt, had no choice but to directly confront the Court in order to advance justice.\n\nWhile commonly associated with (bad president) Jackson, it's also been used by (good presidents) Lincoln and Roosevelt!\n\nNow, I'm no fan of Marbury v Madison. I don't think judicial review should be as powerful as it is today. But this author barely grapples with the fact that it is a sword that cuts both ways. Without judicial review, you don't get Brown v Board, you don't get Roe v Wade, you don't get Chevron v NRDC, you don't get Wickard v Filburn. Without judicial review you certainly don't get the two biggest Left wins in the court in the last decade, Obergefell v Hodges and Bostock v Clayton County. The things being specifically being complained about, West Virginia v EPA and Dobbs v Jackson's WWH, are themselves reversals of previously enacted judicial review!\n\nSo I ask the motte, is judicial review good, or bad? Has it outlived its usefulness, or was it ever useful? And when and how should Marbury v Madison be contested, if at all? I had hoped for a more nuanced take on it, but the article I shared got me thinking.",

The idea is that eating a diet consistent solely of potatoes will lead to considerable weight loss, and the results are plain to see.

SMTM's post sounds deservedly ecstatic, but it also sounds undeservedly like they think they've made a discovery.  \n  \nThroughout the article, they pepper in comments like \"If you predicted (or could have predicted) that the potato diet would cause this kind of weight loss, or if medical / nutritional science could have predicted that this diet was going to be so effective in the short term, and so easy for so many people — then why haven’t doctors and nutritionists been recommending the potato diet to people alongside diet and exercise?\" and \"We understand if you don’t really get this. We didn’t get it either, despite reading about all the previous success stories, until one of us tried the potato diet for ourselves. Hunger vanishes in a really weird way that is hard to describe to anyone who hasn’t felt it directly. So listen to all our participants who are like “no it’s not calories, it’s not willpower”. Or try it for yourself, you might be surprised!\" At a first glance, it's difficult to imagine someone wrote this with anything like serious intent, and these sorts of quotes are commonplace throughout the blogpost. They stand as solid evidence of virtually complete ignorance of this area of research. I'll explain by tackling these quotes.  \n  \nThe first one should stand out to SlateStarCodex readers who remember [this review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/25/book-review-the-hungry-brain/) of Stephan Guyenet's *The Hungry Brain*. At the beginning of Section III, Scott described a very relevant study: \"In 1965, some scientists locked people in a room where they could only eat nutrient sludge dispensed from a machine. Even though the volunteers had no idea how many calories the nutrient sludge was, they ate exactly enough to maintain their normal weight, proving the existence of a “sixth sense” for food caloric content. Next, they locked morbidly obese people in the same room. They ended up eating only tiny amounts of the nutrient sludge, one or two hundred calories a day, without feeling any hunger. This proved that their bodies “wanted” to lose the excess weight and preferred to simply live off stored fat once removed from the overly-rewarding food environment. After six months on the sludge, a man who weighed 400 lbs at the start of the experiment was down to 200, without consciously trying to reduce his weight.\"   \n  \nThe study in question is amply described in the book and can be read in full [here](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb34828.x) (or [via sci-hub](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1965.tb34828.x)). It's really something, but it's also not the only study of its type. There have been plenty of studies on single-food diets, both with animals and humans. The general tenor of their results is that restriction to a singular type of food leads to weight loss. People who read *The Hungry Brain* will be unsurprised that sort of work is cited. The authors over at SMTM evidently read Guyenet (he is cited twice in the linked post), but never read his book or they could not have written that first quote. But, we know from their series *A Chemical Hunger* (e.g., [here](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/07/a-chemical-hunger-part-i-mysteries/), [here](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/11/a-chemical-hunger-part-ii-current-theories-of-obesity-are-inadequate/)), that they at least cite *The Hungry Brain*, and even had [a blogpost on this exact study](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/23/a-chemical-hunger-interlude-b-the-nutrient-sludge-diet/). The blogpost is an unimpressive handwaving exercise by way of ignoring the post-1980 research on this topic and dismissing the pre-1980 research with the reason being that results from before the obesity epidemic really kicked off won't generalize. But this criticism is too broad. In their own potato diet post, they say that they expect their results will generalize, but for some reason, other monotonous diets will not? Perhaps their criticism only applies to this specific 1965 study, although I have doubts since they focus so heavily on potatoes, to the exclusion of general dietary monotony.  \n  \nRegardless, if you read just a few pages more in *The Hungry Brain*, you will discover (p. 65) where Guyenet predicts the result of a dietary content restriction: \"The fact that sensory-specific satiety drives us to overeat suggests a simple solution to the problem: Limit yourself to a few foods.\" What is the potato diet but limiting yourself to a few foods? The quantity of research supporting this point is enormous, so their arguing that it wasn't predicted - when they have evidently read and even written about material predicting it - should be galling for them. The snide remark they make asking why doctors haven't recommended eating potatoes only serves to obfuscate the reality that it is not potatoes that made the difference here, but induced dietary monotony. (Which is different from cross-sectional dietary monotony, both in terms of causes and effects.) To answer their subsequent quote\n  \n&gt; If you knew the potato diet would work, why did you not run this study many years ago? Why are there no clinical trials? Did you think people would not be excited to see this result? \n\nIt's clear that all that needs to be said is \"The studies were done, the trials were run, the results were in, you just ignored them.\"  \n  \nThe \"We understand if you don't really get this\" quote refers to a reduction in hunger with the diet. My best guess about why they \"don't really get this\" is that they misunderstand hunger. Firstly, Guyenet explained their result very well, and his perspective is by no means unique. Secondly, hunger [follows a Circadian-like rhythm](https://eje.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eje/152/6/1520845.xml) and is reduced to a pittance when you completely restrict caloric intake. Consistent with this, [ghrelin levels fall when you fast](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/90/2/741/2836628). That is part of the standard explanation why, after a few days of fasting, you suddenly stop feeling any hunger. Even the subreddit /r/fasting [has a FAQ section mentioning this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/wiki/fasting_in_a_nutshell#wiki_5.2._tips_and_tricks). Hunger is similarly reduced by dietary austerity, and more austere diets yield bigger weight losses and less rebounding, but I don't wish to ramble.  \n  \nAs with the rest of their posts on weight and weight loss, SMTM's latest comes up short. It ignores things they've read, ignores obvious implications, mechanisms, and prior work that should be cited, whilst being replete with generalizability concerns despite failing to acknowledge predictions generalize to cover theories like their own.",

A quick synopsis of the facts as we know them currently (subject to additional information and corrections, of course). \n\n1: Female subject with small daughter in tow attempts to purchase a number of items at a bodega, but her EBT card is declined. The clerk (M/61)runs the card a couple times, then declines the sale. When he gathers the items, the woman begins shouting that he assaulted her daughter, that he \"snatched\" a bag of chips from her etc. Unclear from video angle. \n\n2: Female subject threatens bodega clerk that she will go get her \"N\\*\\*ger\" and \"fuck you \\[him\\] up\". \n\n3: Female subject retrieves her boyfriend, a 35-yo ex con with north of 25 arrests, including multiple arrests for assault and reportedly on parole from an assaulting-a-cop beef.\n\n4: Female and male subjects return to the bodega and initiate first a verbal confrontation, followed by the boyfriend coming behind the counter and assaulting the clerk. The clerk stabs the boyfriend several times, and the girlfriend follows them behind the counter and stabs the clerk three times (exact timeline unclear). Boyfriend dies, clerk's wounds are superficial. \n\n5: NY prosecutors charge the clerk with second degree murder, do not charge the woman at all. They ask for $500,000 bond, the judge gives them a quarter mil bond. Later, under public pressure, the bond is reduced to $50k and enough money is raised to get the wounded clerk out of Rikers. \n\n6: Current status is the clerk has become a local [cause celebre](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/11/us/new-york-bodega-stabbing-murder-charges/index.html), but is still facing a second-degree murder rap. The woman who initiated every stage of the conflict and stabbed the clerk remains free of arrest and charges entirely. \n\nAs I've said many times before, I've lived through this news cycle before. The swing in criminal justice public policy exemplified by BLM and the sort of reforms pushed by the rationalist community (among many others) very quickly started resulting in these sorts of issues. It's a sort of microcosm of systemic failure of the justice system. It combines outrageous social behavior, aggressive violence, the intentional policy of keeping violent criminals free, and swift punishment for the victims of violent crime who dare to defend themselves. \n\nThis is, in my view, the inevitable result of the reheated 1970's policies we are currently implementing in many major cities. When criminals are considered the victims, it is citizens who are the \"perpetrators\". Basic anarcho-tyranny. This is the criminal justice system currently being adopted, and if allowed to fully mature, we will probably see the same sort of crime wave we did in the '70s and '80s, complete with the economic hollowing-out of major cities, a civilian population that will get scared and start arming itself, and a criminal population that will explode when they fully realize that the only people doing time are the ones resisting them.",

The cultural war about gender is one of the main engines of the left today, but suddenly is trivial if the enemy does the same and debate on it? We are supposed to believe that, at the same time, is a stupid issue to die on but it literally save thousands of lives?\nNobody saw the contradiction?",

    "body": "# Why do so many people dislike capitalism?\n\nAnd I'm not saying in this post that there are no good arguments about capitalism, I'm only trying to understand the *modal* argument against capitalism.\n\nI think people inherently don't like being told what to do. When someone compels you to do something, chances are it benefits them more than it benefits you, so we have an automatic reflex to assume that we're being shortchanged.\n\nThe weird thing is, when you look around at modern society, there's no one entity that really tells you what to do. If you don't like your job, you can quit at any time and no one will make you keep working. But then, if you don't have any job, you'll probably have to live on the street and that's not pleasant, so if you want to live a normal life you'll have to find *someone* who has money and convince them to give it to you.\n\nThe system that coordinates this is capitalism, so indirectly, the market forces of capitalism are telling everyone what to do. That inherently makes people dislike it, I think. You can ask yourself \"why am I doing something I hate every day?\" and trace the causal chain back and eventually you'll get to \"because capitalism\". That's probably not going to endear someone to capitalism!\n\nPeople won't say it explicitly, and it feels like of strawmannish to say out loud, but I genuinely think maybe 50% people who say things like \"fuck capitalism\" are imagining in their heads \"Capitalism makes everyone have to do stuff they hate all day and most people don't even get paid that much money for it. Wouldn't it be great if there were a system where nobody had to work and we still had our modern living standards?\"\n\nThrough this lens, a lot of arguments that seemed weird to me started to make sense.\n\n1. The subreddit /r/antiwork. Enough said I think. Some people say that their real goal is just \"workplace reform\" or something like that, but I think that's just the motte. \n2. [Leftie youtube PhilTube made a video about \"bullshit jobs\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_X-812q_Jc). If you're not familiar, [bullshit jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) says that half of all work people do in the developed world is pointless. If you look at his examples, like \"programmers repairing bloated code\", I think you'll find this assertion a bit questionable. But you can understand why it's a very tempting idea: if half of jobs are completely pointless, that means everyone could work 20 hours a week instead of 40 with no loss in productivity! \n3. There's of course the preference for small businesses over megacorps. When a mom and pop shop hires you to work the register, that's not capitalism making you do it, that's just mom and pop asking you to do something for them and paying you for your time. They're probably giving you a good deal, right? But when Amazon hires you to work in the warehouse, even if they pay better than mom and pop and offer better benefits, suddenly is some weird foreign global system that's getting you to work for them. They're probably ripping you off!\n\nAgain, to be clear, I'm not saying there are no good arguments against capitalism or anything like that. I think it's okay to look at bad arguments for position X, as long as you don't come away from that process thinking that those are representative of the best arguments for position X.",
