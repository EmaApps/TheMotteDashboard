    "body": "Ukraine war updates\n\nThis is a slow grinding war of Artillery trenches and drone scouting. Ever since Gennady took over Russia has been steadily and slowly taking ground on [june 19th](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-june-19) Papasna was the frontline and now on [July 18](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-july-18) Papasna is firmly in russian territory and the new frontline is Bakhmut. One major issue with reporting on this war is that it's pretty hard to report on a war where most of the conflict is 50000 artillery shells a day (no seriously) getting fired into a fairly small area followed by a small advance and more artillery. Perhaps the best way to find shelling information is [Thermal anomaly](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#t:adv;d:7days;l:noaa20-viirs,viirs,modis_a,modis_t,street;@37.8,48.1,7z) data because a large scale artillery campaign is visible from such data.\n\nPerhaps the best breakdown I could find of the Ukraine war comes from the [Austrian Military academy](https://youtu.be/dEbLuAPobao) showing just how russian progress has been (slow methodical but definitely moving forward). The grinding down of the Ukrainian forces has been steady, with the UKR forces going from 81 Battallions to 60 while the russians have gone from 93 BTG's to 108 after new reinforcements. (though remember that it's hard to assess the strength of the BTGs) While Thermal anomaly data definitely showed that new NATO weapons had a temporary decrease in russian effectiveness the data appears to show that russian artillery shelling has come back after the operational pause for (what appears to be) logistical reasons.\n\nNew NATO weapons are probably going to make an impact, though given that the US has sent roughly $7 Billion worth of equipment to UKR it's hard to say how much each marginal unit enables. Remember this is also NATO $7 billion so while the weapons work they're not necessarily very good in the \"bang for the buck\" department. In the report by Mr.Resner it's pointed out that the M777 is really vulnerable to damage from Shrapnel, and needs constant repairs to maintain it's combat effectiveness. \n.\n.I keep getting conflicting reports on air defenses, it appears that Ukrianian air defenses are good enough to prevent bombing but they have no defense against air to ground long range missiles., though it appears such ATG missiles aren't very cost effective. \n\nI know reporting on what has become World war 1 with drones is a little boring, but still I'm surprised at how little discussion there is about the only political event to actually remain relevant 5 months after it started in 2022.",

    "body": "Since the start of Covid-era public health policies, one of my hobbyhorses has been beating up on public health agencies, supporting bureaucracies, and related research and being even more scathing when it comes to the science reporting targeted at general audiences. So naturally, when I heard about [a new study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\\(22\\)00847-9/fulltext) out on the impact of alcohol on health and read a couple [news articles](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/14/alcohol-is-never-good-for-people-under-40-global-study-finds) on it, my first instinct was to be similarly scathing regarding the quality of evidence and the reporting thereof. Instead of that though, I want to step back and try to tease apart just how different it is to evaluate that evidence from a public health lens and a personal advice lens. For the moment, let's assume that the quality of data and imputed causal relationships are basically valid and use them as a jumping off point:\n\n&gt;The study, published in the Lancet, found that 59% of those who drank harmful amounts were aged 15-39 – people for whom alcohol provided no health benefit and posed risks, including injuries relating to drinking or car accidents, suicides or murders.\n\nI probably do buy that straightaway - I would bet a fair bit that drinkers are more likely to be in car accidents, commit murder, or kill themselves. From a public health perspective, this is at least suggestive of a plausible causal relationship, even if it doesn't really provide the necessary evidence to legitimize compulsory policies without randomized control trials to accumulate better evidence going forward. \n\nOn the flip side though, should this tell me, a guy in my thirties that probably does drink a bit too much, much of anything about the likely impact on my longevity? Does it make me more inclined to suggest to friends that they cut back or stop drinking altogether? My immediate inclination is to think that my risk of car accidents, suicides, and murders are changed by a rounding error by drinking, even by drinking heavily - I don't drink and drive, I've never had a remotely suicidal impulse, and I'm a pretty non-violent guy that doesn't carry a weapon. *Maybe* there's some marginal change, but it's not much. What about my advice for others? Well, I suppose I can't know their inner state as well - some people are visibly sullen or violent when drinking, so it might be best for them to knock it off. I have no way to weight the benefits for others accurately, but I personally gain quite a bit of joy from the culture and experience of good beers and bourbons and do not suffer any apparent emotional or material impacts on my life.\n\nThis isn't really about alcohol though (although I do invite commentary on that), it's about how the reactions of public health people. The policy people say things like:\n\n&gt;Dr Richard Piper, chief executive of Alcohol Change UK, said: “The emerging science on alcohol, over hundreds of studies over the past 20 years, is telling us very clearly that alcohol is very damaging to the human body in multiple ways. We were previously unaware of this, and too many of us continue to drink as though this revolution in our knowledge hasn’t happened.\n\n&gt;“If you care about your health, by far the best approach is not to drink at all. If you do choose to drink alcohol, listen properly to the UK’s chief medical officers, and do not exceed 14 units a week (about six pints of lager or a bottle and a half of wine), have at least three alcohol-free days a week, and never exceed more than six units in one day.”\n\nThe closing paragraph of the linked Lancet study includes:\n\n&gt;The findings of this study support the development of tailored guidelines and recommendations on alcohol consumption by age and across regions and highlight that existing low consumption thresholds are too high for younger populations in all regions. Additionally, our results suggest that guidelines should not incorporate sex-specific recommendations, given the absence of variation in TMREL and NDE by sex across geographies and locations. Finally, recognising that the majority of the world's population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol are young adults and predominantly young males, in order to minimise health loss due to alcohol consumption it is important to prioritise interventions targeted at these demographic groups.\n\nThe thing about public health is that it's inherently a fairly blunt instrument. If the appropriate conclusion is that many people drink too much, resulting in them causing carnage to the tune of thousands of gruesome excess deaths among the young annually from car accidents, suicides, and homicides, it's pretty rational for the policy people to start thinking about how to get people to drink less. They generally can't afford to undercut their message by hedging and saying, \"well, ya know, unless you're just not going to kill yourself, then it doesn't matter much\".\n\nAs a final thought, it's still worth taking a swipe at the journalists - \"Alcohol is never good for people under 40, global study finds\" is just an absolutely shit summary of the finding.",

[Charges against Jose Alba dismissed](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-charges-dismissed-harlem-bodega-worker-jose-alba-20220719-wpukj3ga2zfrdgomjh7efybbke-story.html).\n&gt;Prosecutors said Alba had at least two strong self-defense arguments to pursue: That he feared Simon might kill him, and that he believed Simon was committing a burglary by stepping behind the counter without permission.\n\n...\n&gt;But other facts of the case weighed in Alba’s favor, the prosecutor wrote. Simon was 26 years younger than Alba and five inches taller. The bodega clerk is 5-foot-7.\n\n&gt;“Simon’s conduct in entering the store’s small, private area, throwing Alba against the wall to a place he could not escape, and grabbing him by the collar could inspire deep fear in an older and shorter man as to what might be in store next,“ Sigall wrote.\n\n&gt;Sigall added, “This was also in the context of the girlfriend saying five minutes earlier that her boyfriend was going to “come down here right now and f--- you up.”\n\nMuch that seems inline with various comments noting the physical disparity between the two men and how that might factor into a self-defense claim as well as the initial remarks from the girlfriend threatening Alba and their impacts on self-defense/robbery.\n\nInitially I was a bit confused about the prosecutors in dismissing the case saying they didn't think they could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Alba was not justified but apparently in New York, self defense is a [justification](https://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article35.php#p35.00) not an affirmative defense which balances things much more in favor of the defendant.",

This is not *unprecedented* in Delaware courts but it is a very aggressive schedule. Musk wanted a date *next February* which, while also not unprecedented, is much longer than these actions typically take. The Court split the difference (not really) and set the trial for five days in October. This seems to bode pretty poorly for Musk, assuming all the time he wanted before the trial is time he thought he would actually need.",

    "body": "I’ve noticed that the term incel has begun to be used as more of a catchall pejorative for sexism of any kind (at least on the internet) which strikes me as odd. I don’t really like when people use the term incel as an insult to people who bring up redpill/PUA/manosphere-type things, since I suspect there’s a lot of non-incels who find these things interesting and I personally think some of it has value. But from the perspective of someone who is trying to insult a redpill/MRA type in a heated Reddit argument, it at least makes sense to call them an incel. Incels afaik do really tend to be into these ideas, and people who excessively harp on them can come across as resentful about their own personal struggles with women.  \n\nWhat’s odd to me is when I’ve seen it used to describe people who make fun of the WNBA, or say that women shouldn’t be NFL coaches, or don’t like women comedians, or make banal observations about women being more sensitive or dramatic or whichever stereotype. The reason it’s odd is that in my experience, low-level sexism or observations/jokes about sex differences are extremely common, even more so among guys who are typically successful with women. I suspect I have a relatively more “normie” upbringing than the typical commenter here, I played sports like football and baseball in high school, went to a good but not elite large public university, was in a social fraternity, and have many uncles and cousins who are all blue-collar tradesmen types. I can’t think of anyone I am close with from sports, HS, college, family, etc. who has had any trouble with women, and definitely none who are redpill types or incels.  \n\nMy whole life, among men of all ages, races, incomes etc. it seems like it’s extremely common to be “casually sexist”. Making “women be shopping”-tier observations about gender differences, or saying women are more [insert stereotype] is very normal, and some more mean-spirited or harmful things like making fun of the WNBA, or saying women couldn’t be NFL coaches, or calling certain women “gold-diggers” wouldn’t be uncommon. It also seems common for my girlfriend or my mom and their friends to make similar observations about men, calling them clueless or lazy or unable to pick up on social cues or not knowing what to do with babies. It also seems these kinds of jokes or observations were popular in sitcoms and comedy movies in the past. It just seems odd to me that this kind of thing would come to be associated with “guys who can’t get laid”, especially since it seems like misogyny/sexism is also somewhat associated with the jock/frat bro stereotype. \n\nI’m not trying to argue whether any of this is good or true or sexist or not. It just always seemed like it was relatively common to me and mostly lighthearted. (I also don’t want to argue whether casual sexism is *harmful* I am just saying the things I am describing aren’t *intended* to be *hateful*).  \n\nI guess my questions are: am I correct that this is normal or am I in a particularly sexist bubble? Was it normal in the past, but isn’t anymore? Or am I just overthinking this, and random people on the internet are just using incel to mean “vaguely sexist” without really caring about being accurate? I suspect it’s the last one and potentially a mix of the other two, but I do wonder if there is a genuine taboo-ing of even the most harmless kinds of gender-stereotype humor among younger generations. Or possibly: I am I just way off on where the line is between “casual/acceptable/normal” level sexism, and something like “making fun of the WNBA” is more in the “hateful towards women” category of sexism?",

America's biggest rivals, China and Russia, are also quite weak too even compared to the Cold War.\n\n&gt;Or like the second half of the 20th century, which witnessed several assassinations of statesmen and other important people, including John and Robert Kennedy, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr., and also the attempted assassinations of Pope John Paul II and Ronald Reagan, in addition to the civil rights movement, the South flipping from Blue to Red, and endless crime waves and race riots that continued until the mid 90s, when crime finally began to fall. Regarding Roe v. Wade, unlike the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, there has been close to zero civil disobedience regarding abortion rights. The BLM riots of 2020, as bad as those were, had far far fewer deaths and injuries compared to the Rodney King riots. Jan 6th is not like 911, as much as the left wishes it was. Yeah, there is a lot of societal decay, such as homelessness and drug use, but this is not destabilizing, nor will it lead to unrest. Elites will continue to retreat from everyone else and the decay, forming their own enclaves and close-knit communities.\n\nI think Pinker's  [Long Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Peace) thesis is still intact even though things may seem worse, thanks to social media , which has the effect of amplifying bad news, so it's hard to look at things in the correct context.  Thanks to social media, every small or isolated event of unrest is broadcast worldwide to billions of people in real time, whereas 40+ years ago similar events would have gone ignored or only mentioned in passing in a local newspaper.  Russia's war with Ukraine does not threaten this post-ww2 geopolitical 'order'. Compared to the conflicts of Vietnam, WW2, or even the Yugoslav Wars, the Russian-Ukraine war doesn't  even measure up to a single battle of WW2, let alone the entire thing.",

The officer, armed with a rifle, asked his supervisor for permission to shoot the suspect. However, the supervisor either did not hear or responded too late.\n\nPrior to anyone dying there was an armed police officer on site with a bead on the shooter *after* he had fired on two civilians and into the school from the outside. He did not engage the shooter.\n\n&gt;At 11:35:55, all three Uvalde Police Department (UPD) officers entered the structure through the west door into the west hallway. These officers were equipped with the following: one with external armor and two with concealable body armor, two rifles, and three pistols.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:36:00, four officers entered the south hallway through the south door closest to the suspect. It is not clear what equipment these officers had with them. Four more officers entered the west hallway through the west door at 11:36:03.\n\nWithin three minutes of the shooter entering the building, there were at least *eleven* police officers in the building, all with firearms and vests of some sort. At least two, possibly more, had rifles. They do not engage the shooter.\n\n&gt;At 11:38:37, an officer outside of the hallway advises the suspect “is contained.” (BWC)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:40:58, the suspect fires 1 round according to audio estimates. (ISS)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:41:30, dispatch asked via radio if the door was locked, a UPD officer responds, “I am not  \n&gt;  \n&gt;sure, but we have a hooligan to break it.” (BWC)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:44:00, the suspect fires one more round according to audio estimates. (ISS)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE ASSESSMENT 8  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 11:48:18, a UCISD PD officer enters through the west hallway door and states, “She says she is shot,” referring to his wife. He is escorted outside of the building.\n\nDespite being just behind the shooter, who continues to fire intermittently throughout the standoff, the cops hole up and carefully insert their thumbs deep into their collective rectums.\n\n&gt;At 12:06:16, UPD RL notes that no Command Post is set up, advised bodies needed to keep parents out.\n\nNo one is in charge and the only concern of the cops is to keep anyone who might tackle the shooter out of the school, be it their own officer whose wife was at that moment bleeding out mere feet away, or the parents.\n\n&gt;By 12:13:00, dispatchers had received numerous 9-1-1 calls from a child explaining that there were several children and one of her teachers deceased and another teacher hurt in room 112.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 12:15:27, it appears tactical team members of United States Border Patrol Tactical Teams (BORTAC) arrive  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 12:21:08, four shots are fired by the suspect from within one of the two classrooms. (ISS)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;From 12:21:16 until 12:34:38, a continuous conversation takes place in the south hallway,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;involving UCISD PD Chief Arredondo and a UPD officer discussing tactical options and  \n&gt;  \n&gt;considerations including snipers, windows, and how to get into the classroom. They also discussed  \n&gt;  \n&gt;who has the keys, testing keys, the probability of the door being locked, and if kids and teachers  \n&gt;  \n&gt;are dying or dead. (BWC)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;From 12:37:45 until 12:47:25, UCISD PD Chief Arredondo attempts to negotiate with the suspect, speaking in English and Spanish  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At 12:50:03, an ad Hoc team assaults room 111, neutralizing the suspect\n\nSo that's the greatest hits of the timeline. To push in on some issues we discussed previously:\n\nWindows:\n\n&gt;The exterior walls of each classroom had two 3’ x 4’ windows near the opposing corners of each classroom (see Figure 3). The bottom of each window was approximately 3’ from interior floor level, and they were equipped with mini blinds. From the exterior, the windows were approximately 4’ from ground level.\n\nSo four windows total covering both classrooms, and at a height that a normal size man would have no trouble seeing/shooting through from the outside.\n\nExternal door:\n\n&gt;on this day the door was not locked, and because it was not locked, the attacker was able to immediately access the building.\n\nInternal door:\n\n&gt;the suspect is seen entering the room, exiting the room, and then reentering the room again prior to officers entering the building at 11:35:55. The only way to engage the lock is to insert a key from the hallway side of the door. At no point is the suspect observed entering the hallway and engaging the locking mechanism. Based upon this, we believe that the lock to room 111 was never engaged.\n\nJesus H. Shitfucking Christ. Then there's this gem:\n\n&gt;As noted in Figure 6, there was a window in the center of each classroom door. Officers could have utilized the window to send accurate return fire back at the suspect.\n\nInitial attempt of the police to enter:\n\n&gt;As the officers approached the doors, the suspect began firing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This gunfire caused both teams of officers to retreat from the doors. We note that the officers did not make contact with the doors (i.e., they never touched any part of the doors)\n\nThis was at the point in time when they had eleven officers with at least two rifles available. Only two officers (one with a rifle) attempted to get to the door, and they both ran away as soon as rounds started coming through the drywall. The \"grazing injuries\" seem to be fragments of the wood/drywall rather than bullets.\n\nSo what should the officers have done, according to the experts?\n\n&gt;Perhaps the simplest plan would have been to push the team back down the hallway and attempt to control the classrooms from the windows in the doors. Any officer wearing rifle rated body armor (e.g., plates) would have assumed the lead as they had an additional level of protection. A team of 4 officers could have utilized the windows in the doors to control a large portion of the classroom from the hallway......  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If the officers believed that they could not establish control through the doors, they should have found another way to stop the killing and dying. One option would have been to breach the exterior windows of the classrooms.....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Both options a and b could have been done simultaneously. The window breaks could have been used to signal the start of the assault and draw the suspect’s attention from the doors. The window officers would stay behind the cover of the exterior wall while the door officers had priority of fire. Then the window officers could stand and cover the rest of the room.\n\nWell fuck me running, what sort of tactical genius would it take to have thought of that?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vb5h8j/culture\\_war\\_roundup\\_for\\_the\\_week\\_of\\_june\\_13\\_2022/iciz2ij/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/vb5h8j/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_june_13_2022/iciz2ij/?context=3)",

    "body": "Wesley Yang is out with a short [new piece](https://wesleyyang.substack.com/p/yes-things-are-really-as-bad-as-youve) by a leftie public school teacher who works in a blue state and a blue city but who nonetheless can acknowledge some of the craziness coming out of the woke left these days. Nothing all that new here but it's nonetheless bracing to be reminded about how deep some woke stuff goes.\n\nThe most shocking part:\n\n&gt;\"1) I once attended a meeting where we brainstormed strategies to increase AP enrollment. When we moved to discuss the gap in enrollment between Black and white students, a senior teacher said that trying to register more children of color for AP classes is inherently racist and that putting greater value on AP classes at all is an expression of white supremacy. To clarify: I don't mean that a senior teacher expressed a complex set of ideas regarding racial justice that could be uncharitably reduced to those claims. I mean I sat in a room where a senior teacher literally spoke the words Trying to register more students of color for AP classes is inherently racist and Putting greater value on AP classes at all is an expression of white supremacy, to an audience of other teachers who nodded along or otherwise kept quiet.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2) I once attended another meeting - lots of meetings when you’re a teacher! - where we were working to approve a new weekly schedule for students. When I said I was concerned that it would require leaving some sections of the curriculum untaught, a colleague said that might actually be a good thing, because most of our students are white and their test scores dropping slightly would help shrink the racial achievement gap in our state. Again, to clarify: I don’t mean my colleague had a a more nuanced approach to testing that a dishonest interlocutor could twist to sound like that. I mean my colleague literally spoke those words. (To be fair, one other teacher did speak up and challenge them this time, albeit very politely.)\"\n\nI don't have a ton to add here. I've read dozens if not a 100+ articles like this in the past couple years, but they haven't stopped getting my blood boiling. What hope is there for a society captured by an ideology like this?\n\nSometimes I feel a little sad that I haven't had kids yet (I just turned 30). But then I think: If I had had kids earlier (and when I was more of a true believing leftist), then they would probably have been exposed to this kind of toxicity by now. At least having kids later will mean I'll know better than to let them into public schools (or for that matter even into most private schools, many of which are also woke-captured sometimes to an even greater degree than public schools).",
