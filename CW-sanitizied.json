    "body": "How about some more Twitter/Musk drama to round out the week? Last Friday Musk filed (under seal) his reply to Twitter's complaint and his own counterclaims. There was a minor dustup between [Twitter](https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=308452085&amp;z=9dde261e) and [Musk](https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=308462636&amp;z=7b23ae73) about *when* the redacted copy of his reply could be made public. Court rules require that it be published five *business* days after it's filed under seal (so today) while Musk wanted to publish it on Wednesday (after five *calendar* days). Ultimately each side's lawyers had a meeting with the judge who ruled in favor of Twitter that Musk couldn't file it until today.\n\nIn any case we now have the redacted copy of [Musk's reply and counterclaims](https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=308502776&amp;z=225aeced) as well as [Twitter's reply](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_news/2022/08/Twitters-Reply-to-Verified-Counterclaims.pdf) to Musk's counterclaims. If you can only read one document I recommend Twitter's, since it basically goes paragraph by paragraph through Musk's document and offers Twitter's response. Mostly this response is not very informative (\"Denied\") but sometimes it is.\n\nThere are five counterclaims Musk asserts against Twitter.\n\nThe first counterclaim is for fraud, specifically with respect to Twitter's SEC filings and the fraction of its monetizable daily active users (mDAU) that are bots or spam accounts. I don't think this count is particularly likely to succeed. Twitter's statements in its SEC filings are extremely hedged and basically come out to \"We did process X, which involved significant judgment, to estimate the number of bots and got result Y. This result could be wrong.\" Musk's assertion that this is fraud seems to rest on (1) his own belief that Twitter's process is not very good and (2) an analysis his team did (that did not mimic Twitter's) on a different data set (that Twitter says does not include most mDAUs) which found a much higher number. I don't think either of those are fraud, so I don't think this is going anywhere.\n\nThe second counterclaim is for violations of the Texas Securities Act. Now, I'm not a lawyer and definitely not a lawyer practicing in the Delaware Court of Chancery, but is that even a thing? Does the Delaware Court of Chancery have jurisdiction to enforce Texas' state securities law? I actually have no idea here but it stuck out to me.\n\nThe third counterclaim is for breach of contract surrounding Twitter's refusal to provide Musk's team with certain information they requested. I suspect the outcome of this count turns a lot on how the judge interprets the language of the agreement. Musk seems to construe it pretty broadly as requiring Twitter to give him basically info he wants but I don't think the court is going to agree.\n\nThe fourth counterclaim is another breach of contract claim predicated on the departure or firing of certain Twitter employees after the announcement of Musk's purchase offer and Twitter's acceptance. This again seems like it comes down to a determination about the specific language of the contract, what Twitter did and did not need Musk's consent to do. I suppose my benefit of the doubt is with Twitter but again, I am not a lawyer.\n\nThe fifth and last counterclaim is seeking a declaratory judgement that a material adverse event (MAE) exists and is ongoing due to the number of mDAUs being much lower than Twitter has represented. If there were an existing and ongoing MAE that would be a basis for Musk to terminate the agreement. Given what it has taken for a Delaware court to find an MAE [in the past](https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2018/10/delaware-chancery-court-finally-finds-an-mae) I think this is unlikely to succeed.\n\nOverall I remain pretty confident the court is going to find for Twitter and order specific performance. Twitter's stock price is up almost 4% today which makes me think the market agrees.\n\nETA:\n\nAs regards claim four Twitter asserts in its 14th affirmative defense that Musk's claim under Texas law is barred by the agreement's specification that Delaware law controls:\n\n&gt; Defendants’ Counterclaim under the Texas Securities Act is barred, in whole\nor in part, because Delaware law governs all claims arising out of or relating to the\nMerger Agreement.",

(Part of [a series on housing](https://old.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/8a9o5i/on_the_nimby_subject/), mostly in California.) I was waiting on this year's legislative session to conclude to post another update ([the local AARP endorsed parking reform!](https://twitter.com/AARPCA/status/1554502644177182722)), but this seemed extra relevant.\n\nMarc Andreesen, co-founder of Netscape and of Andreesen Horowitz, techie luminary and Bay Area presence, is most recently known for his 2020 essay [\"It's Time to Build\"](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/) ([previously discussed here](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/g0ck7p/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_april_13_2020/fnw1l2q/)). Among other notes about how our civilization does not *build* things, it cited housing as a problem:\n\n&gt; You see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We can’t build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential — which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. We also can’t build the cities themselves anymore. When the producers of HBO’s “Westworld” wanted to portray the American city of the future, they didn’t film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin — they went to Singapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they?\n\nThis is [Housing Element](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/housing-elements-hcd) season in the Bay Area, a once-every-eight-years process by which every city must update part of their General Plan to accommodate a share of regional housing need, address governmental constraints to housing, affirmatively further fair housing, and so on. The process has been going on since 1969, but it's much more meaningful now; the numbers are higher, the sites inventories have to be plausible, the consequences of noncompliance are unknown but potentially [severe](https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/research/a-primer-on-californias-builders-remedy-for-housing-element-noncompliance/), and so on.\n\nAndreesen lives in Atherton, a small city of about seven thousand (down from eight thousand in 1970) primarily known for its [hilariously low-intensity police blotter](https://www.mercurynews.com/2011/08/27/the-best-of-atherton-police-blotter/). Atherton must [plan for 348 new homes](https://abag.ca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021-12/Final_RHNA_Allocation_Report_2023-2031-approved_0.pdf#page=29), about three-fifths of which must be below market rate. Currently, the city has two kinds of zones which accommodate homes: one with a 13,500 square foot minimum lot size, and one with a one-acre minimum lot size; as a result, [cops and dispatchers can't live anywhere near the city](https://www.almanacnews.com/news/2018/05/04/atherton-looking-for-place-for-officers-dispatchers-to-sleep-between-shifts). The city's [draft Housing Element](https://www.ci.atherton.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/10417/Atherton-Draft-Housing-Element_Complete_6_9_2022#page=41) plans to allow six, occasionally eight, and in one instance sixteen homes per acre on land totaling 16.64 acres, or one two-hundredth of the city.\n\nAndreesen and his wife wrote the following letter to the city:\n\n&gt; Dear Mayor DeGolia and Members of the Atherton Town Council,  \n&gt; I am writing this letter to communicate our IMMENSE objection to the creation of multifamily overlay zones in Atherton. Multifamily development is prohibited in the Atherton General Plan and any change in zoning and land use rules should only be considered after a thoughtful General Plan amendment process, that includes significant community outreach, participation and comment. Please IMMEDIATELY REMOVE all multifamily overlay zoning projects from the Housing Element which will\nbe submitted to the state in July. They will MASSIVELY decrease our home values, the quality of life of ourselves and our neighbors and IMMENSELY increase the noise pollution and traffic.\n\nThere are some mistakes in here; the Housing Element update is *part* of the General Plan amendment process; [a thorough community engagement process](https://www.ci.atherton.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/10417/Atherton-Draft-Housing-Element_Complete_6_9_2022#page=90) is mandated by law and described in the draft (among other things, \"A special edition of the Town newsletter was prepared and physically mailed to every address in Town\"). But more to the point, I'm reminded of [Robert Reich's yard-sign hypocrisy](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/i2r8qo/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_03_2020/g0eu6dh/) in the same way. It's Time To Build... Somewhere Else.\n\n[All of the public comments are here](https://www.ci.atherton.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/10529/Public-Comments-and-Summary-Info), all 270 of them, of which the vast majority (85%, according to city staff) were of a similar nature. Notable participants included Tim Draper of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, arguing that \"If we stall, I suspect the mandate will go away with a new political wind\". He seems to be right; [all of the multifamily overlay zones have been removed from the city's plan](https://www.ci.atherton.ca.us/627/Housing-Element-Update) as of this week.\n\nWhile it's fun to point out hypocrisy, the *real* lesson here is that while it would be reasonable for individuals to have lots of power over the use of their own land, or regional/state governments to have that power, the weird middle we're in, where land-use power is wielded in practice by whoever can make life hardest for their city councilmembers, has led to the current mess in California. Atherton isn't where the housing crisis is worst; it's just a particularly sharply drawn example.

There is actually a reference, but it's quick.  I missed it when I saw it live.\n\nI feel like there's a lot to unpack here.  Fetterman is going to fight Washington?  Where his party has the White House, the House and the Senate???  Because people feel forgotten, like their best time was a generation ago?  A decade of left-leaning media has taught me that that's a blatant racist dog-whistle, appealing to aggrieved white entitlement.

Managing to go *a whole five years* without a *fatal* shooting seems like the kind of low bar you describe as damning with faint praise.

Why the pay gap? Perhaps it's because of systemic sexism. Perhaps it's because no one watches WNBA games and the NBA subsidizes it to the tune of $10M/year. But I'm less interested in understanding that than why WNBA players can move to Russia in the off season to make millions.\n\nTo state the obvious: Russia is not richer than the US; it's not more populous than the US; Russians are not more into basketball than Americans; and Russians are not big on feminist signaling compared to the US.\n\nSo what's the story with the seven figure payouts? The obvious answer is that Russian women's basketball is just money laundering, but it's not clear how women's basketball would offer a good vehicle for that. Is it oligarchs bringing over accomplished female athletes for salacious reasons? Maybe, but it's not like Russia is lacking in ballerinas and figure skaters who are genuinely world class in their spheres (and Griner in particular is not the type to be interested in men). And I can't buy that it's genuine interest in the sport.\n\nThe best answer I've been able to come up with is that it's just a way for Russian oligarchs to show off and compete with each other, but even if so, why settle on women's basketball of all things?",

    "body": "This was intended to be a reply to a comment by u/Ilforte but it took on a life of it's own. It's a theory I've had for a while and it was stoked by the comments below about DeSantis and the 2024 election: Biden isn't running in 2024. Even if his approval rating recovers I don't think he has it in him, and that's the kind of decision that has to be made before he'd know if his approval rating would recover, and he'd be taking a risk that it would tank and hand the election to the Republicans. That being said, he can't exactly come out and say that he won't be seeking reelection. He'd immediately become a lame duck and serve the last 2 1/2 years of his presidency in irrelevance. He could be the greatest president in history for that last 2 1/2 years and it wouldn't matter because everyone would be focused on the massive primary field that would develop. And he can't just name Kamala Harris as his successor, because nobody likes Kamala Harris, and this dislike would be intensified since she's already vice-president and we'd see newspaper headlines about what a horrible \"dry-run\" she's having. \n\nSo the best chance for the Democrats is for Biden to hold off as long as possible in announcing anything. There will be a lot of media speculation but Biden will just say that it isn't important. Any serious candidates for the nomination will be forced to hold off lest they find themselves running against an incumbent. Then, at the last possible moment, he announces he's not running but really wants you to consider voting for Amy Klobuchar (or someone else who's not Kamala Harris) in the primary. Since no one other than Amy Klobuchar has gotten word that the president isn't running, no one else is ready to stage a primary campaign, and we end up with a repeat of 2016 except without Bernie Sanders. \n\nAnd the Republican side isn't as locked-in as people seem to think it is. First, if Trump runs again, he's probably going to lose. Biden's baggage may rub off onto the other Democratic candidates, but Trump has plenty of his own baggage that's far worse. He already lost the 2020 election, and his behavior afterwards was appalling to anyone who didn't vote for him. True believers may brush off the MASSIVE FRAUD conspiracies and Jan. 6, but very few Biden voters will, and he needs to convert a lot of Biden voters. \n\nDeSantis has his own dilemma in that his nomination becomes more difficult if Trump decides to run. Everyone says that he's young enough to wait—he'll only be 50 in 2028—so there's no rush. The problem is that it's not so simple. He's the current star Republican, and his star can fade. Who's to say whether someone else might steal the spotlight by then? Furthermore, he's able to stay in the spotlight because he takes bold high-risk, high-reward actions in the culture war. He's been successful so far, but it may only be a matter of time before he oversteps. Already, the Reedy Creek mess may come back to bite him in the ass if the choice is between abandoning his position or the state assuming $1 billion in Disney's debt. (Honestly, losing the inevitable lawsuit may be the best thing for him politically.) He's had decent instincts so far, but if the pressure to stay in the national spotlight ramps up then he might take increasingly unjustifiable risks.\n\nWith that being said, he may have to take a shot at the nomination in 2024, Trump or no Trump. The choice is 2024 as the heir-apparent against a bunch of also-rans, 2024 as the rising star against Trump and (probably) Trump alone, or 2028 as former Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in a field of thousands. (Or, less likely, in 2032 in a field of thousands after some nobody took on Trump and surprisingly ended up as president.) On the one hand, running against Trump seems like a bad bet; despite claims of waning influence in the party, the candidates he's endorsed have done exceedingly well in the primaries. On the other hand, all these candidates could lose. Dr. Oz is down by double digits in a purple state against a committed leftist. J.D. Vance is down in the polls and it's questionable whether he's actually running a campaign. Herschel Walker is, well Herschel Walker. If the Republicans underperform in the midterms I'd say it's pretty much over for Trumpism as a national force. Thus, DeSantis is in the ironic position of hoping his own party underperforms in the midterms because it gives him a clear path to the nomination regardless of whether Trump runs. If he loses to Trump and Trump loses the election then he's still alive in 2028 because he can credibly say that Trumpism is a losing proposition and the country needs to move on. Of course, I'm probably wrong and we'll see Trump v. Biden in 2024.",

    "body": " Finland’s NATO quest, still probably globally the most important development this country is a part of, is advancing. The [US Senate just voted to confirm](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/us/politics/sweden-finland-nato-senate-vote.html) Finland and Sweden as NATO members. Of course, the vote was a bit of a formality with a predestined result and a 95-1 vote, with Josh Hawley the only senator opposing. It should be noted that [Hawley’s perspective](https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-op-ed-why-i-wont-vote-add-sweden-and-finland-nato) is by no means an isolationist one, let alone pacifist, but rather the argument is that the European countries are not pulling their weight on defence and that US should focus on the China threat anyhow.\n\nNow, Hawley is, of course, entitled to his opinion, and it’s hardly my task from Finland to dictate that US has some sort of a duty to be allied to Finland if they don't wish so (of course, the votes of the other senators and Congress in general indicate otherwise). NATO membership might currently be popular in Finland, but it’s hardly without issues, as recounted [here](https://jacobin.com/2022/04/finland-nato-russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-sweden) – and out of the raised fears, Turkey has certainly proved that it can get [troublesome](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/30/erdogan-warns-turkey-could-still-block-finland-and-swedens-accession-to-nato). \n\nCertainly I've seen some pro-NATO voices say that they are less positive on the organization than before Erdogan started issuing his demands and that they don't consider the organization worth it if it means having to junk longstanding human rights policies, like extraditing people without due process simply because another country demands it.\n\nHowever, slam-dunk as the US approval was, Hawley’s given reasoning still seem like they need commenting. It’s not a new idea that many in the US think will focus on the Pacific sector and away from Europe is not a new one. However, one would think that such a development would precisely, at least within conventional geopolitical logic, be predicated by Europe becoming militarily more independent from the United States. It’s hard to imagine how adding the Finnish army to the mix would increase this dependence.\n\nWhile many European countries indeed have not had their defence budgets at 2 % of the GDP, as Hawley himself noted, Finland has just recently [increased this budget considerably](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-05/finland-adds-2-2-billion-defense-spending-in-shadow-of-war) to match this limit. This was during the most left-wing and thus most anti-militarist government constellation that is currently realistically possible in Finland, and the more right-wing and conservative parties in the opposition would, if anything, support even larger military budgets. \n\nSince much of the new budget spending consists of material procurement with long-term orders, it’s going to be sticky for at least the coming decade. There’s an issue in comparing the military budgets of different countries, as NATO counts several things in military budgets that Finland currently does not count, such as military pensions, as mentioned [here](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/14/what-finland-can-offer-nato/), for example.\n\nFinland has specifically traditionally based its defense mainly on land forces and solutions that are not \\*that\\* expensive, ie. do not require high-tech weapons platforms. In particular, the FDF has concentrated on building up its artillery, with the [strongest artillery in Western Europe](https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2022/05/13/finland-has-53rd-strongest-military-but-artillery-capability-sets-them-apart/). Precisely this war in Ukraine has shown that the era for such traditional armies is not in the past, and indeed the current phase of the war, by all accounts, seems to be one where artillery continues to be the king, with Russians blasting away at Ukrainians and Ukraine seeking to even the score using HIMARS. As many have noted, this war is basically exactly the one FDF has always trained for.\n\nOf course, one might reasonably ask still whether FDF would still need copious naval and air support from other countries, chiefly the US. The Finnish Navy is… well, not really the mainstay of the Finnish defence, and the air force, even with F35s, has generally not been expected to hold its own independently against Russia. \n\nThat score is considerably evened by the fact that the pacakge deal also includes Sweden, a country with weak land forces but a stronger navy and particularly air force. The Finnish and Swedish armed forces just fit together quite well, which has been one of the reasons why one of the main alternatives conceived to NATO in Finnish debates has just been a formal defence alliance with Sweden.\n\nAll told, while a real case might be made, within American context, for opposing the expansion of NATO, Hawleys’ arguments don’t really give an impression of such a stance - mainly that there’s political credit to be had in portraying yourself as an anti-hawk on Russia in a situation where there is room on the American right for that niche.",

You can thus argue that the people who voted Warren in largely agree with his stance.\n\n* It doesn't appear that there have been any *actual* cases where the State declined prosecution, so this appears to be a pre-emptive move by DeSantis. Although they allege that there is a non-prosecution policy for crimes where the initial encounter with police was due to non-criminal violations.\n\n* Prosecutorial discretion is indeed a recognized legal concept which is usually given broad deference. I know of no mechanism by which anyone can *force* a State Attorney to bring charges against a given suspect/Defendant. This is a powerful tool because of double jeopardy protections, which means if given charges are officially dropped by the State Attorney, they can never be brought again, even if a *different* State Attorney argues that they were dropped for 'improper' reasons. The whole point is that the prosecutor doesn't have to explain themselves.\n\n* With that in mind, I actually wonder if Mr. Warren hadn't signed the public pledge, and instead had just quietly ordered his prosecutors to decline to prosecute any abortion cases that weren't, shall we say, 'egregious,' he might not have been noticed and the case for removing him might be much weaker.\n\n* There is a yet-untested argument that [Florida's Constitution actually *does* protect abortion](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/06/florida-15-week-abortion-ban-state-constitution-privacy-rights.html) because Florida's 'right to privacy' amendment was added after *Roe* was decided and thus could, even after the recent SCOTUS decision, be determined to have intended to codify abortion as part of the right to privacy.\n\n\nMy own thoughts: \n\nDesantis continues to show willingness to flex his authority as Governor in very targeted ways. This action is probably less objectionable than his moves targeting Disney since the subject is a government official who is directly employed by the State.\n\nAt a basic level, I have to agree with the action. Whatever your thoughts on the validity or morality of a given law, it is the very *definition* of dereliction of duty for a state attorney to decline to enforce laws that the legislature has passed and the governor has signed and thus nominally represent the will of the state's electorate. Their whole job, prosecutorial discretion or no, is to enact the will of the people of the state as expressed in its laws by prosecuting violations of said laws. It would be outrageous if a state attorney were to refuse to prosecute a given law in exchange for monetary gain, it is only somewhat less outrageous to refuse to prosecute for purely political reasons. \n\nSo even if people take this as yet *another* sign of DeSantis' fascistic ambitions to rule Florida, and later the Country, with an iron fist, this is still an utterly justifiable exercise of executive authority, and is well *within* the limits of the authority delegated to the Governor, so you cannot truly argue that this is a troubling expansion of executive authority by a power-mad wannabe Despot. \n\nLeaving aside the extant problems of enforcing abortion restrictions when it is simple to travel to a different state to get one, having a 'sanctuary city' for abortions *within* the state would render the entire law almost moot since  Hillsborough County is at most a 4 hour drive from anywhere in the state except the deepest part of the panhandle.\n\nAnd end of the day, it is a savvy move by Desantis as it will of course garner support from his base, it should also cause many possible opponents to keep their heads down, and the ones who will be emboldened to fight back pretty much already despise him, so net result is he has simply shored up his already strong position with minimal effort or political capital expended.\n\nI see a few likely effects intended by this action. \n\nThe First order effect is removing a rebellious official who might have grown into a bigger problem down the line. Whatever other steps Warren takes from here, he won't be able to use his position as a government official to legitimize his actions.\n\nSecond order is a warning to other state government officials, and not just state attorneys, that if they publicly assume a stance in defiance of the State Government, they will be summarily removed without prior warning and no waiting until they actually *do* something objectionable. This one action will probably force many other officials who quietly agreed with Warren to dutifully stay in line during Desantis' tenure. \n\nThird-ish order is probably to prevent any sort of camel's nose from entering in the tent which could possibly lead to an avowed leftist like [Chesa Boudin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesa_Boudin) getting elected and declaring amnesty for other classes of crimes. \n\n\nIt is also possible that this is aimed at being a direct response to [George Soros'](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-i-support-reform-prosecutors-law-enforces-jail-prison-crime-rate-justice-police-funding-11659277441) recent piece declaring his intent to continue to support/fund 'reform-minded prosecutors.' This action would basically close that off as an avenue for social agitation in Florida.\n\nThe primary way this backfires is if Warren runs for office again and is elected again and thus a clear message is sent to Desantis that the constituents are rejecting Desantis' influence and defying the laws he has championed. I'm not sure how it shakes out, ultimately, if a given district 'goes rogue' in electing someone *because* he promises to defy the state's authority. Desantis and the GOP-controlled legislature could absolutely escalate by taking actions that target the city/county/people more directly, but that would probably draw more ire than its worth.\n\nMaybe he'll find some use for that [newly reformed state guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Guard) after all.\n\nIt's probably similar to how many [County Sheriffs will state their refusal to enforce gun control laws](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696400737/when-sheriffs-wont-enforce-the-law). Arguably as long as their jurisdiction doesn't turn into a zone of open rebellion/insurrection necessitating intervention by state-level authorities you just leave things be and govern 'around' the problem.\n\n**EDIT:** and just so I cannot be accused of strawmanning, [here](https://twitter.com/NikkiFried/status/1555197696608182272) is a Democratic hopeful for the Florida Governorship in this year's election calling Desantis a \"wannabe dictator\" and this action \"outrageous and dangerous\" without elaborating. [Here's](https://twitter.com/CharlieCrist/status/1555227810326880256) the other hopeful echoing the 'wannabe dictator' language and calling it an 'attack on women' (but making the reasonable point that the State Attorney was elected twice so maybe his constituents like him.)\n\nSo this is in fact what the mainstream Democrats are willing to say about a Governor exercising lawful authority to ensure the enforcement of a (presently) valid law of the state.",

    "body": "**A Few Takeaways from the Kansas Abortion Referendum**\n\nKansas holds a place in American discourse as the prototypical \"Red State\"; it a Democratic presidential candidate hasn't won the state since 1964, and a Democratic Senator hasn't represented the state since 1939. They have had Democratic governors (including the incumbent, Laura Kelly) but hey, nobody's perfect. More importantly, the state was the subject of the book \"What's the Matter with Kansas?\"—which was later turned in to a documentary film—which tried to explain why relatively poor rural people tended to vote \"against their interest\" for conservative Republican politicians. (I use scare quotes because I think it's rather presumptuous that someone decide someone else's interests for them, especially if they don't actually know that person and are relying on broad demographic information.) \n\nOf course, the truth is more complicated than that. I'm friends with a couple who lived in the state for several years after they both got postdocs at Kansas State University, and their initial trepidation of moving to the prairie after living in one of the hippest parts of Pittsburgh for a decade turned into an unexpected adoration. While the people there were definitely Trump-supporting conservatives, there was none of the bitterness that one would see in Appalachia. My friends reckoned that this was because there was no deindustrialization that left people longing for a glorified past America; these were simply people whose families ranched cattle for generations and always made a decent living from it and had six kids and always voted Republican because they always voted Republican. It probably also didn't hurt that practically any farmer would let the husband hunt deer on their property, in contrast to Pennsylvania, where people pay good money for private hunting leases and most people are stuck with overcrowded public game lands and state parks. And the Democratic governor? My friends said that she won simply because her campaign focused on solving the state's budget crisis while GOP opponent Kris Kobach focused his campaign on illegal immigration. In a state with few immigrants period, let alone illegal ones. Apparently, Kobach had become a punchline within a few weeks of nomination, even among people who ended up voting for him.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the citizens of Kansas voted yesterday on an Amendment to the state's constitution that would remove limits on the legislature's ability to regulate abortion. The average observer who bought into the \"What's the Matter with Kansas?\" rhetoric assumed the measure would pass handily. Professional journalists and others who were actually paying attention saw the issue as a tossup. So when the measure failed, the surprising thing wasn't that it failed, but that it failed by a 20 point margin. It's as of yet unclear what such an outcome means, whether for the midterms or abortion politics generally, so here are my initial thoughts:\n\n**1. This won't help Democrats in the midterms**\n\nTo be fair, it won't *hurt* them either, but I wouldn't expect a ton of pro-choice Republicans to start voting Democrat. The referendum focused on a single issue, but actual candidates have to deal with as many issues as are necessary. Additionally, now that abortion is primarily a state issue, I would expect that most GOP voters would prefer to have it addressed in state houses rather than Congress. This may also have an effect on the Kansas gubernatorial election. The race is currently a tossup, but Republican challenger Derek Schmidt was on record as supporting the measure and argued the losing position on behalf of the state in 2019. He did, however, temper his position by claiming that termination of nonviable pregnancies did not meet the definition of abortion under Kansas law and would thus not be affected by a constitutional change, though his opponents pointed out that any abortion legislation could define terms however lawmakers wanted. This is a moot point now, but it remains to be seen how Schmidt handles the issue going forward (my guess is that he says the people have spoken and moves on to other things) and whether this tips the scales in favor of Laura Kelly. But I'm no expert in Kansas politics so this is all speculation.\n\n**2. This may have a huge effect on Republican abortion rhetoric**\n\nIn recent years, it's been rare for any Republican running for office to say anything that could remotely be conceived as pro-choice, and the Republicans that did were almost all in New England or the Mid-Atlantic. A quick perusal this morning of comments on the Fox News website and r/conservative shows that the attitude in these places seems to be \"This is what we wanted—leave it up to the states, and let the people decide. The people of Kansas have spoken.\" While I agree that this is a reasonable position to take and I don't doubt the sincerity of those taking it, this isn't exactly what was advertised when it came to overturning *Roe*. Pro-life advocates in states like California didn't want to see *Roe* overturned out of abstract support for Mississippians' right of self-determination; they wanted it overturned because they wanted people in Mississippi to stop killing babies and hoped that one day California would pass such legislation as well. Certainly, some Republicans in Congress have been advocating for some sort of national ban, despite the knowledge that such a ban would likely be opposed by a majority of voters overall. And while I haven't looked into it that closely, it would appear that very few Republicans at the state level have voted against trigger laws and other restrictions in states that have enacted them.\n\nIf the vote proves anything, it's that Republican opinion on abortion isn't as uniform as Republican politicians seem to have assumed. I don't expect a wave of pro-choice Republicans getting elected on a platform of expanding abortion access in states that have restricted it. I do, however, expect a lot of Republican politicians to ditch the anti-abortion rhetoric that they assumed was getting them votes. Sure, some will know that their base is heavily Evangelical and will have no good reason to stop, but for others who rely on a broader base and need to expand their support they may realize that the issue alienates as many as it attracts and will stop hammering on it. At the Federal level in particular, it may be more politically expedient to defer the issue to the states and leave it at that. At the very least, I would expect the constant barrage of pro-life rhetoric coming from the Right to ebb at least somewhat and no longer be at the point where every Republican running for office has to trot out his pro-life credentials.\n\n**3. Expect more ballot measures**\n\nSome states allow for direct ballot measures and a number are already scheduled, as one would expect. What's been left out of the conversation thus far is what happens in states that don't allow for direct ballot measures; some states require voter approval for constitutional amendments, but these measures have to be proposed by the legislature before they go to the ballot. If the national GOP shifts its rhetoric from \"Abortion is wrong and should be banned\" to \"Abortion is an issue that should be decided by the states\", then state legislatures are going to be under pressure to actually allow the people to decide. Pro-life state legislators might not be vulnerable on their votes for abortion restrictions directly, but they may be vulnerable if they steadfastly refuse to submit the question to the people. Some may argue that it's impractical to turn every matter of state law into a constitutional issue and that elected bodies are the best way of enacting the will of the public, but this argument isn't particularly effective when it involves what was clearly a national constitutional issue for fifty years and is one of the most controversial issues of the past two generations. If one looks at the referenda most of these states have put on the ballot in the past, the vast majority of it is stuff that most voters wouldn't find particularly interesting or controversial. In Pennsylvania in particular, the legislature has a tendency to submit items for constitutional amendment as a means of passing a sort of \"Super Law\" that's really hard to get rid of.",

Two states, Hamburg and Mecklemburg-Vorpommern, did so to extend things for another month, a triumphant success for the wary majority of Twitter users, journalists, bureaucrats and of course government members, most of whom were in some way opposed to lifting Covid measures. Sadly for them these two federal states actually continually had higher case rates than the rest of the country throughout the entire period they kept up with mandatory masking and vaccine passes. \n\nIn the time after up to today, the manic predictions of many of the people mentioned above did not come to pass, an insult compounded by the result of an investigation by a government commission staffed by experts in the field (many were proponents of stricter measures) which failed to find much or even any impact on health outcomes attributable to anything Germany did during the pandemic. Only mask mandates come out unscathed in the report, but not via a careful analysis of German data, but simply by citing the extant body of scientific literature on the topic.\n\nSo, why am I writing all of this? Shouldn't the (German) Covid hawks be defeated, their doomsday predictions falsified, their prestige trashed, their credibility destroyed, their control mania shown to be useless? Sadly no, it's Germany after all, we love our rules and [rules we shall have](https://twitter.com/Karl_Lauterbach/status/1554809274412548097/photo/1). The linked picture shows a list of powers that the federal states will have starting October 1, only a few of which are mandatory (masking in public transit and hospitals), but all of those on the left (including mask mandates in public spaces, testing requirements or proof of recent (past three months) vaccination/infection) can simply be put into effect if the local government desires it without a vote in parliament or a veto by anyone. Given the comments by leading figures at the federal state level, it's all but guaranteed that these things will be enforced right from the get-go.\n\nThis new law still has to pass a vote in federal parliament, but given that our health minister is already tweeting out the list from above it seems like it's a foregone conclusion that it will pass. At this point, I really don't know what to say anymore. We're at something like 99% antibody prevalence among the population, the most vulnerable are long dead or vaccinated, hospitals have shown no signs of difficulties, even despite our stringent measures up to March Omicron ran trough and gave half the population a confirmed infection (in reality probably close to everyone), basically every country around us is done with this stuff, and yet here we are, chugging along. Resistance is limited to boomers raging on Facebook and the online comment sections of newspapers and a few stragglers of the much maligned Querdenker (\"crossthinker\") movement that had a populist-right and conspiracy theory vibe to it. It seems that basically everyone with an ounce of power or prestige in Germany is determined to keep this up as long as possible.\n\nTo make this rant a bit more interactive: what is the state of Covid discourse in your locality? What measures are there still, do people or politicians talk about it a lot, what are the plans, if there even are any, for winter? Also, to our neighboring countries: I am very sorry for everything Germany has done to you, but *please*, [~~Morgenthau~~ ](https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/origin-163.jpg?w=480&amp;h=270&amp;crop=1) us, I'll learn Polish, Danish, anything (EDIT: Morgenthau might be a bit extreme, see comments below, on googling something like a more extended [Bakker-Schut plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_annexation_of_German_territory_after_the_Second_World_War) might be more appropriate).",

If anything, remarkably, British media now appears to devote more attention to these issues than their American counterparts.\n\nThis provides some support for the concept that the UK is a cultural colony of the US. Cultural hegemony is a hell of a drug.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;As concepts have become much looser, our national debate has become more divisive —ironically just as the country is becoming a much more tolerant, accepting, and welcoming place.\n\nGuided by the beauty of our memetic superweapons....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The end result is a media that is simply socially constructing a very warped picture of the country we live in, which is playing an active role in driving the division.\n\nThis brings us back to my old hobbyhorse, which is that bigotry is essentially a conspiracy theory about the world that justifies (in the mind of the bigot) their insane hatreds and tactics. The parallels between things like anti-semitism and anti-white-supremacy pretty much write themselves. The construct that the world is rigged against \\[decent people\\] by the evil racist \\[Other\\] who is implacably hateful and infinitely destructive, and thus all extremism is \\[self-defense\\] is as old as group hatreds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;This has also almost certainly been exacerbated by how media today has also become far more dependent on degree-holding journalists who have usually passed through elite private schools and universities (about 44% of Britain’s columnists went to one of only two universities —I will let you guess which)\n\nThis is directly another point of mine, which is that this whole woke thing has been primarily a revolt of the upper-class and the upwardly-mobile against the proles. The word games, the holier-than-thou moralizing, the vicious anger over the most minor of slights. This has been the attempt of the aspiring aristocracy to enact something very close to sumptuary laws. Instead of an appeal to their natural superiority or divine right, these neo-aristocrats claim immunity from criticism and a slate of special privileges based on their supposed disenfranchisement, poverty and victimization. Which is a bit rich coming from graduates of the most rarified schools in the world. Part of the ineradicable conflict of social justice was always that it was a top-down movement of and for the rich, connected and famous. A lot of other people jumped on the bandwagon, and even more just kept their heads down, but this is and has always been a movement driven intellectually by the upper classes.\n\n&gt;our new victimhood culture —which is especially strong in the elite institutions— instead incentivizes people to define themselves first and foremost as members of a victimised group, to derive their sense of social esteem, social status, and recognition from this status, and to punish, aggressively, perceived oppressors.\n\nThis is, for instance, why I think the obsession of the left over the last decade has been to ram the concept of \"self-identification\" through, and shut down any criticism. They need the concept because a pack of mostly-white, mostly-rich, mostly-straight and very well connected posh twats are running their mouths about \"social justice\", and their identities don't give them enough protection in the progressive stack. Self-ID gives them an easy out! Anyone can be \"genderqueer\" or a \"nonpassing trans lesbian\"(also known as straight dudes). The profusion of sexual identities feeds a fundamental need for validation in the stack.\n\nThe movement was only viable so long as they could keep anyone from pointing out the Emperor's dick. That fundamental phenomenon may be coming to a close.",

Dripped up like a drug addict, muscles wasting away, puddles of drool... The source of protein probably would be bugs or some synthetic cocktail. Connotations: pod, bugs, cattle, drug-addict, weakness, dependence, unreal.\n\nIf you reword self-made-human's proposal as calling for ultimate mastery over the universe so that everyone can do whatever they want, what's wrong with that? What about the will to power? What about moving ever forward as a technological civilization? What about the urge to climb mountains and conquer the stars?\n\nImagine instead that you're an ascended intelligence with a body that spans kilometres, absorbing the ferocious energies of the Sun for fuel, in a constant state of hyperawareness about the universe. You know more than our civilization, you think thoughts we can't even imagine. You're watching your neighbours if they try to infringe upon your million-trillionth of the Sun, armed and ready. You play, modify and return games with your friends. You're in discussion with all kinds of obscure communities, you're politically engaged in the debates about interstellar travel: who will get to take the next few stars? Connotations: immortal, celestial, inhuman but immensely powerful.\n\nI bring up positivism because there is what I think is an aesthetically motivated backlash against positivism. I was talking with [/u/IG111](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/wda188/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_01_2022/iiq0nl4/), who objected to \n\n&gt;The real world is only a very complex technical environment with various parameters to optimize.\n\nIsn't this the case? Don't we want to maximize fun (interpreted broadly as some combination of romantic love, good conversation, physical competition, intellectual activity)? Don't we want to maximize our power in the universe? Perhaps we don't know what parameters we want, perhaps our optimization ability is constrained and perverted by technical limitations. Perhaps we took one step forward and two steps back because of these limitations. But in principle, isn't optimizing the end-goal?\n\nThat seems to me to be the inevitable end goal of positivism. You use empirical experiments to acquire power and get what you want. There's been a reaction on the left away from positivism, that's where we got critical theory and the degrowth/anti-industrial wings of environmentalism. But there aren't many critical theorists on the motte. \n\nI think there's also been a movement on the right away from positivism, examples above. See:\n\n&gt;godless (metaphorically) science fiction version of paradise\n\n&gt;Nothing, they'll be stuck in a pod or chip doing nothing.\n\nI think there's a bunch of right-coded concepts about the value of strength, personal sovereignty and hubris floating around that makes people object to certain cultural conceptions of the positivist vision (epitomized by the [comic](https://twitter.com/merryweatherey/status/1185636106257211392) above). Is this so? Or am I just bad at modelling?",

    "body": "I see a lot of negativity directed online at Andrew Yang's new \"Forward Party\", including some here on the The Motte, from the general perspective that \"obviously third parties can't work\".  But it's easy to see that Yang, whatever else he may be, is not an *idiot* -- he must know the structural reasons why third parties can't gain traction in the American system.  So given that he's not an idiot, what is trying to achieve here?  What does he *say* he's trying to achieve, and how does he answer the obvious \"spoiler\" critique that everyone's making?\n\nIn this [interview with *The New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/andrew-yangs-third-party-aspirations), Yang's asked:\n\n&gt; So the idea would be to get Democrats and Republicans to sign up for the Forward Party’s agenda, not to run candidates in the Forward Party to challenge Democrats and Republicans?\n\nand replies\n\n&gt; Having someone run on the Forward Party line would be deeply impractical in the vast majority of districts around the country. We’re going to be supporting candidates who support these principles. I’m sure the vast majority of them are going to be running as Democrats or Republicans, because that’s much more realistic.\n\nHis response to the \"spoiler\" critique, then, is that his party is not, like a traditional political party, generally aiming to actually field potential-spoiler general-election candidates under the Forward Party banner.  It's more like an \"endorsement party\" -- a way to coordinate like-minded people around supporting major-party candidates who support certain principles.\n\nBut we already have organizations that exist to support major-party candidates without fielding their own -- interest groups create PACs and Super PACs.  Both are legally limited in influence -- PACs are limited in campaign expenditures, and Super PACs are limited by not being allowed to \"coordinate\" directly with campaigns.  \n\nIt sounds to me like Yang wants something like a Super PAC that's potentially able to coordinate with major-party campaigns, but he doesn't have a better legal structure than \"political party\" to operate under.  But what interest group wouldn't want to be able to start an organization like that?  If an interest group's forming a new party were a viable political strategy that somehow circumvented the limitations on PACs and Super PACs, why doesn't any given interest group start their own \"political party\", that happens to not field candidates but only exists to direct support toward ideologically-aligned major-party candidates?  \n\nI don't understand the relevant legal landscape here well enough to say, but it seems like Yang's project is suffering from people's assumptions about what a \"political party\" is supposed to do, when he's actually trying to create something else.  But if he's actually innovating some new variety of political organization, what's stopped other people from doing so in the past?",

The amendment was a reaction to a [Kansas Supreme Court ruling](https://www.kscourts.org/KSCourts/media/KsCourts/Opinions/114153_2.pdf?ext=.pdf) from 2019 that found the Kansas constitution protected a fundamental right to abortion. This ruling required state regulations on abortion to overcome strict scrutiny to be constitutional. The [full text](https://sos.ks.gov/elections/22elec/2022-Primary-Election-Constitutional-Amendment-HCR-5003.pdf) of the amendment:\n\n&gt;Because Kansans value both women and children, the constitution of the state of Kansas does not require government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to abortion. To the extent permitted by the constitution of the United States, the people, through their elected state representatives and state senators, may pass laws regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, laws that account for circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, or circumstances necessary to save the life of the mother.\n\nAs someone whose pro-choice I'm encouraged by this result. The people of Kansas apparently prefer a constitutional right to abortion to having legislative control of it. I don't want to generalize this too far outside of this one race but it seems to indicate abortion may be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\nETA:\n\nI didn't know about this when I wrote the above but something similar happened in Mississippi in [2011](https://ballotpedia.org/Mississippi_Initiative_26,_Definition_of_Person_Amendment_\\(2011\\)). Mississippi had a ballot initiative trying to amend their state constitution so that the definition of \"person\" would include \"every human being from the moment of fertilization.\" That amendment was defeated by a pretty similar margin (58-42).",

His blanket summary is that while computers can outperform humans in tasks, his example is Watson   winning Jeopardy, it failed miserably when being applied to other tasks such as diagnosing illnesses and creating treatments. AI thinking in probability and statistics while humans think in patterns and narratives.\n\n&gt;AlphaZero can beat every human in chess and Go, but it doesn't know that there is a game that's called chess or Go.

It has a concept of a school bus.\n\n&gt;So, what I'm saying: artificial intelligence, as in deep neural networks, has a very different kind of intelligence that does not resemble, much, human intelligence. Basically, to understand that deep neural networks are statistical machines that can do very powerful look for correlations. That's not the greatest ability of the human mind. We are strong in causal stories. We invent, we are looking for.\n\nThe biggest problem with AGI is not that it will think or imitate a human, but that a human believes that machines *are* thinking like humans.  Humanity is not just the external interaction between people, but also the internal thoughts, narratives, and emotions that go alongside these actions.\n\nDespite this, we have significant needs for an AGI to be developed and deployed.

    "body": "A minor (major?) culture war story from here in Australia.\n\n---\n\nLidia Thorpe, an Australian Greens (Australia's progressive party) Senator representing Victoria in Federal Parliament, made [headlines during her swearing in ceremony by describing the Queen as a 'colonising Queen' and raising a black power fist](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/thorpe-s-coloniser-queen-oath-out-of-order-as-former-leaders-find-backbench-20220801-p5b6an.html) (apologies for the source, but basically no apolitical coverage exists). Eventually, she was told to retake the oath as written, which she did, but strongly protested. This incident became prominent in not just domestic Australian news, but made it into international news.\n\nLidia Thorpe is a Indigenous woman and activist, is no stranger to these kinds of controversy has been involved with various culture war issues in the past. She's a major provocateur, and a model progressive culture warrior.\n\n---\n\nSome debate has emerged over the truthfulness and validity of Thorpe's statement. Thorpe herself stated: \"It's a fact, it's truth. It's not something to get upset about... If people are hurt by truth, then we need to keep talking truth so we can get people on board and educate people.\"\n\nOn one hand, you can argue that her statement that the Queen is a coloniser isn't true because the Queen herself has personally done very little to actually colonise anyone. This is seems to be the form most mainstream pushback against Thorpe's statement is taking.\n\nHowever, looking at Thorpe's statement in context of what else she said, she has a point. The Queen is the head of Australia, and Australia *is* a colonial state (or maybe post-colonial state), at least in the sense that Australia as a state is result of British settler colonialism, and it forms the foundational basis of our culture to this day.\n\nI think the real issue is that Thorpe is breaking, probably intentionally, a unspoken agreement in Australian society, and Western liberal post-colonial society more broadly. I think the agreement goes something like this: don't call any of us individually, specifically colonists, racists, or other bad term, and we'll agree with you that those things are bad.\n\nWhat Thorpe is doing is essentially putting her ideological opponents (which include mainstream politicians) in a double bind, and I believe she is very aware of what she is doing. Everyone has agreed that colonialism is a bad thing that we oppose. So when she accuses a prominent, respected and essential figure like the Queen of being a colonist, her opponents can either:\n\n- Just deny any association between the Queen and colonialism. This is weak because it doesn't actually refute the arguments made by Thorpe and other progressives, which do have some legitimacy to them.\n\n- Admit the Queen is a coloniser or otherwise concede to her point, which is basically agreeing the Queen (and Australia) is bad and illegitimate. Which no non-progressive politician actually wants to do, least of all because it delegitimises the very political system the politicians operate under.\n\nWhat politicians *can't* do is say, 'yes we admit the Queen is a coloniser and Australia a colonial state, but *that's a good thing*'. Well, outside of some far-right political pariahs like Pauline Hanson. But the more that Thorpe and other progressives pushes and prods and tries to break the unspoken post-colonial 'liberal agreement' on topics like race and colonialism, the more I think people will eventually just say 'fuck it, you know what, I like Australia, colonialism is good, actually.'\n\nThis story has a strong similarity to the issue of white identity and white racial consciousness in the US and the Western world. The unspoken liberal agreement for the last 50 or so years has been for whites to supress any white consciousness or identity, which has seemed to work reasonably successfully, as white rarely do think about themselves in racial terms compared to other ethnic groups. But this is changing as progressives are deliberately trying break the status quo and stoke white racial consciousness, albeit only in self-flagellating and guilt ridden form. But this runs the risk of white eventually saying 'enough, if you want me to be racially conscious, I will do it on my terms, I don't want feel guilty' and becoming actual racists. I suppose the progressives would still see this as a win.\n\nThere was a similar story to this one a couple years ago in Canada where [NDP leader Jagmeet Singh called a Bloc Québécois MP racist in Canadian Parliament](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-jagmeet-singh-rota-racist-therrien-1.5616661). Singh was also breaking that unspoken agreement, I believe.\n\n--- \n\nTo conclude, one interesting thing I noticed about this news story is that there was no coverage of it by the ABC, our national public news broadcaster. At least, I can't find any articles about it on their website. The only national Australian public news [coverage I could find of it was from NITV](https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2022/08/02/senator-lidia-thorpe-makes-international-headlines-after-colonising-queen-oath), a publicly-funded Indigenous news and broadcaster, which was unsurprisingly strongly favourable to Thorpe. If you think the ABC's lack of coverage might be due them not wanting to report on 'culture war' type topics, they were more than happy to [run a story a few days ago when Pauline Hanson, a far-right Federal Senator walked out during the acknowledgement of country](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-07-27/pauline-hanson-walkout-acknowledgement-of-country/101275080) (those statements which acknowledge land is stolen from Indigenous/First Nations/Native peoples).",

Here's the [complete official translation](https://miniszterelnok.hu/speech-by-prime-minister-viktor-orban-at-the-31st-balvanyos-summer-free-university-and-student-camp/), and [subtitled video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyNVFIo23Bg).\n\nSummaries by [Hungarian portal 444](https://insighthungary.444.hu/2022/07/28/orban-causes-outrage-for-opposing-mixed-race-society-in-hungary), [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/viktor-orban-against-race-mixing-europe-hungary), [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/27/europe/viktor-orban-hungary-race-speech-intl/index.html).\n\n&gt; Migration has split Europe in two – or I could say that it has split the West in two. One half is a world where European and non-European peoples live together. These countries are no longer nations: they are nothing more than a conglomeration of peoples. I could also say that it is no longer the Western world, but the post-Western world. And around 2050, the laws of mathematics will lead to the final demographic shift: cities in this part of the continent – or that part – will see the proportion of residents of non-European origin rising to over 50 per cent of the total.\n\n&gt; In such a multi-ethnic context, there is an ideological feint here that is worth talking about and focusing on. The internationalist left employs a feint, an ideological ruse: the claim – their claim – that Europe by its very nature is populated by peoples of mixed race. This is a historical and semantic sleight of hand, because it conflates two different things. There is a world in which European peoples are mixed together with those arriving from outside Europe. Now that is a mixed-race world. And there is our world, where people from within Europe mix with one another, move around, work, and relocate. So, for example, in the Carpathian Basin we are not mixed-race: we are simply a mixture of peoples living in our own European homeland. And, given a favourable alignment of stars and a following wind, these peoples merge together in a kind of Hungaro-Pannonian sauce, creating their own new European culture. This is why we have always fought: we are willing to mix with one another, but we do not want to become peoples of mixed-race. [...] The time will come when we have to somehow accept Christians coming to us from there and integrate them into our lives. This has happened before; and those whom we do not want to let in will have to be stopped at our western borders – Schengen or no Schengen.\n\nOne long-term (20+ years) advisor of his, the sociologist Zsuzsa Hegedüs (who is Jewish herself) has stepped down after the speech and called it \"pure Nazi text worthy of Goebbels\", due to such explicit references to \"race\" (\"faj\" in Hungarian).\n\nShortly after the speech people realized that it is almost verbatim from a 1973 book. In fact Orbán mentions the book just a bit before the above section:\n\n&gt; There is an outstanding 1973 book on this issue which was written in French, and recently published in Hungary. It is called “[The Camp of the Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Camp_of_the_Saints)” [Le Camp des Saints], and I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the spiritual developments underlying the West’s inability to defend itself.\n\nThe NYT wrote [an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/books/stephen-miller-camp-saints.html) on it in 2019: \"A Racist Book’s Malign and Lingering Influence - “The Camp of the Saints,” published in 1973, has been a must-read within white supremacist circles for decades. Stephen Miller, Marine Le Pen and Steve King have touted it in recent years.\"\n\nMost of the above quoted speech section is from the intro of the book, including exact phrases like \"historical and semantic sleight of hand\". Orbán('s speech writers) basically just swapped the \"Gallo-Roman sauce\" of the original French book with \"Hungaro-Pannonian sauce\".\n\nCommon directions of criticism were 1) that Hungarians are also mixed, no population is racially pure, 2) Hungarians came from Asia, 3) it's biologically inaccurate to talk about \"faj\" (=\"race\", \"species\") regarding humans.\n\nInterestingly, or not, back in 2012, Orbán also called Hungarians \"half-Asian\" ([HU source](https://24.hu/belfold/2012/07/26/orban-veszekedos-felazsiai-nep-a-magyar/)):\n\n&gt; \"My philosophy is that unity is a question of strength: if there is strength, there is unity,\" he said. There are other ways of forging unity - for example, in the Scandinavian countries - but he believes that the Hungarians are incapable of doing so. \"That's the only way it works with half-Asian derivatives like us. Here everyone is clever, everyone knows better, everyone has a better idea,\" he said.\n\n[Turanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turanism) and emphasizing cultural or other relations to Turkic peoples have been common over the last ~150 years on the conservative right wing in Hungary. So how does this add up? Not so well, because the text was essentially taken out of a French nationalist context, and it doesn't fit so well. The actual far-righters in Hungary, like the Our Homeland Movement have been talking about a \"Northern Civilization\" (\"from the Celts all the way to the Japanese\") instead of Western for some time now, exactly for this reason, and I guess as a way to get closer to the Russian far-right vision of Dugin's Eurasianism.\n\nSo saying that Hungarians came from Asia misses the point (well, it's arguable anyway in a modern genetic sense, and even if so, the origin was near the Urals, the border of Europe). Orbán and the far right's problem is with Africans and Middle Eastern Muslims.\n\nHe has since stated that his speech may have been misunderstandable, and he actually just meant cultural differences, not biological. But the word \"race\" was unusually blunt even for Orbán. He usually talks in terms of religion (Christianity vs Islam) or cultures and civilizations, not races. In fact, the Hungarian word he used (\"faj\") is now quite taboo in this sense, today it's only used in the meaning of \"species\" (of animals or plants). Another common criticism came from this angle: that humanity is one species, *Homo sapiens*. This is a very shallow criticism but apparently many felt that it's some kind of gotcha, that Orbán doesn't even know basic biology and doesn't understand the concept of \"species\". Except that \"faj\" used to be a much broader term, for stuff like ethnicity, nationality, race, species etc.\n\nZooming out a bit, it's clear that Orbán loves the kind of attention that these speeches give him. It's like antifragility, he thrives on being demonized and gets stronger each time when he survives these. So, since there was a possibility of difficulties at home (due to economic problems, they can't keep to their election promises just a few months after their re-election), he decided to cause some controversy so he can again frame things in this way, that all conflict with the EU ultimately stems from the issues of migration, gender, Soros etc. That's his home turf, that's the lens he wants on everything.\n\nOn Thursday, Orbán [will speak at CPAC Texas in Dallas](https://www.newsweek.com/von-der-leyen-rips-orban-over-mixed-race-speech-cpac-still-welcoming-him-1729399), to the outrage of American media.\n\nSo, 1) Most of this wasn't even Orbán's own ideas but took it verbatim from a book, 2) The reaction to it was lazy criticism, the nth iteration of calling Orbán a fascist or feigning ignorance about meanings of words or performatively not understanding that by other races Orbán meant Africans and Middle Easterners, not Uralic Asians. 3) Orbán needed nothing other than exactly that, to be criticized for his stance on migration and gender instead of utility price hikes and tax raises.\n\nSo is he a racist? It doesn't matter because this is post-politics. People perform to get reactions, it's not about beliefs. A prominent journalist from Orbán's circles, Zsolt Bayer (shown [here](https://nepszava.hu/3162052_nemeth-szilard-bayer-zsolt-alsoors-rasszizmus-polo-fenykep) with a Secretary of State) wore a \"white lives matter\" T-shirt just a few weeks ago. It's hard to tell what one should interpret as sincere opinions (if that's even possible for a politician to have) versus pure posturing. But it's mostly just two sides symbiotically needing each other to justify themselves.",

    "body": "UKRAIN WATCH TIME: \n\n2 weeks a go I registered some predictions that I thought were pretty optimistic in Ukraine's favor; turns out I was too pessimistic. \n\nRussia is hauling out the museum piece 152's from the 1920's for second line units; the tempo of their advance and quantity/quality of artillery fire has dropped off way quicker (Like, an order of magnitude quicker) than I thought it would.\n\nApparently, the HIMARS shoot and scoot has been working. Ukraine can't push Russia where they are strong; but Russia can't advance along an entire front anymore without taking unsafe risks.\n\nThis on top of Ukrainian counteroffensives in Kherson; and (maybe? Questionably?) drama amongst the Russians staff running the war (apparently the two top guys hate each other, and refuse to allow one to be elevated over the other.  Water cooler shit though, so who knows.)\n\nBasically: I predicted slow Russian advance for some time until their logistical problems caught up to them and they couldn't just atomize their problems with a zillion guns, then a frozen front until some political solution was reached or Russia got their economy in gear; which was wrong.",

    "body": "Is gender identity like a [fursona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fursona)? The comparison isn't motivated by \"haha look at how ridiculous these people are,\" it's specifically around reframing the following:\n\n&gt;Everyone has a gender identity, but most people are [cis by default](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/01/28/cis-by-default/)\n\nTo something more like:\n\n&gt;The genderqueer community is comprised of people who have gender identities, which may involve wearing clothing of their preferred gender... A small minority of them express a desire to become, or already see themselves as, their gender\n\nSince I've just committed analogy in the first degree, I expect the low-decouplers to be out in full force, so here are a few objections I foresee:\n\nPossible counter: \"Well, most people don't have a fursona but most people do have a gender identity\". Reply: I think both parts (before &amp; after the 'but') are potentially wrong:\n\n* Don't most people have a \"human by default\" fursona?\n* Do most people *actually* have a gender identity?\n\nTo expand on (2): the language around gender identity is maximally confusing. \n\nAs an example, I posed the question \"do you have a gender identity? what is it?\" to my dad and he said \"of course I'm a male.\" despite not knowing what LGBTQ activists really think about gender identity. If two people say \"my gender identity is man\" that **does not mean they are really saying the same thing.** A less confusing language would be to call gender identity a \"fnord\" and then my dad would realize that he has no idea what a \"fnord\" is, just that it is something controversial.\n\nPossible counter: \"this is not how people use the words 'fursona' and 'gender identity'\" to which I reply: this is missing the point. I am engaging in prescriptivism here, and I'm claiming that speaking as if normal people have gender identity \\[the way activists mean it\\] is misleading. That activists enthusiastically say it's OK that gender identity means different things to different people makes me think this confusing language is intentional.\n\nHow should I react to a furry telling me my fursona was a human? I would probably tell him I'm not a furry, sorry, not for me, but good for you. Should my reaction to activists asking me about my gender identity be any different? \"Sorry, not for me.\"",

    "body": "The TPUSA conference tipped its hand about the cultural direction the American Right might be moving in. Tons of interviews, speeches, etc from prominent conservatives suggesting that it would be best for America to embrace Christian Nationalism. This raised some alarms; there is strong research connecting Evangelicals to conspiracies such as QAnon (among others) that could eventually lead to danger or even violence (ex: Jan 6th, the 26% of W. Evangelicals who \"agree that true American patriots might have to resort to violence in order to save our country.\" - PRRI).   \nMy question: How much of a threat does the Christian Right pose to American democracy and peace? A shrinking demographic who may believe they are losing their country, when paired with their renowned civic activism and news media that reinforces their increasingly conspiratorial beliefs, might just be the recipe for outbreaks of political violence. Needless to say, this trend of the Christian Right has me sincerely concerned.\n\nI also want to quickly get out there that [Gordon Wood](https://moodle2.units.it/pluginfile.php/366505/mod_resource/content/1/Conspiracy%20and%20the%20Paranoid%20Style.pdf) and [Richard Hofstadter](https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/) did some pretty well-known work on American/Colonial paranoia, suggesting that the colonists (many of whom had strong religious ties) viewed history as moments caused by individual actors rather than a stream of events. This allows them to attribute moral responsibility to bad actors and in doing so reveals how the good deed/bad deed doctrine of many Christian denominations might make believers more susceptible to conspiracy theories. After all, conspiracies are based on an idea that a small cabal of people are plotting something nefarious, like the Hellish plot of #PizzaGate.  \nWoods suggested that this \"individual actor\" thinking still runs strong in American veins. If so, am I being overdramatic in [this short essay](https://coachspo.substack.com/p/an-american-conspiracy-movement-that) where I claim that Christian Right conspiracies pose a significant threat to American safety?  \nA helpful recap of my essay: \"I believe there are warning signs around us. The size of the Religious Right is perpetually underrated in America and they are adopting conspiracy theories at a startling pace. What’s more, these theories are dangerous precisely because they promote the idea that White Christians are losing their status and identity. As Professor Walter proposed, when this happens the chance that a nation falls into violence or a Civil War only increases. Perhaps it was no coincidence that during the Insurrection the “Heavenly Father” was prayed to on the senate floor.\"",
