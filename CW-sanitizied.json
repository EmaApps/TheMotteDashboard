    "body": "Obituary #3.\n\nDarya Dugina, the daughter of the philosopher and Culture Warrior [Alexander Dugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dugin) whom I've been sporadically translating here over these years, was killed some hours ago. Maybe it's a traffic accident, but then it seems to be [of the explosive kind](https://www.thedailybeast.com/darya-dugina-daughter-of-putin-propagandist-alexander-dugin-killed-in-car-bomb-reports-say).\n\nShe was a member of the «International Eurasianist movement», with all that entails (e.g a LARPy black robe with a golden Chaos star); she was supporting the «special military operation», and got added to American and UK sanction lists. But she likely wasn't the target: her father ^1 was expected to be in the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving on Mojaiskoe highway near [Bolshiye Vyazyomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshiye_Vyazyomy) in the Moscow Oblast. They were returning from a certain «Tradition» fest.  \n\nBeing a high-profile Russian Nationalist is a reliable way to cut your life expectancy. Igor Shafarevich had made it to 93, dying in 2017, but he had always been built differently. In the two Covid years preceding the Z day, it's been getting rough. Eduard Limonov: March 2020, 77. Konstantin Krylov died in May 2020, aged 52, from a stroke. Maxim Martsinkevich [got suicided](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/iseo9j/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_september_14/g5n3d1i/) in prison in September 2020; he was 36. [Egor Prosvirnin](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/rphmgp/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_december_27/hqq1tfi/), as I've reported before, had flown out of the window and crashed into the asphalt on December 27th, 2021, at 35. Darya was 30.  \nI'm reading another Darya sometimes: Kozeko, Yale-educated, @digitalgonzo96 (account inactive). She comments on boylove fiction and local sushi restaurants, opportunistically wages «information warfare» and complains about shelling noise and water supply breakdowns. She's living in Donetsk. Probably I won't be reading any new Kozeko at some point in the not too distant future.  \n\nAs for Dugina, the obvious suspicion falls on Ukrainian agents, aided by Western intel, or perhaps on their local sympathizers. Ukrainians have demonstrated their capacity to carry out assassinations *on the outskirts of Moscow* [years ago](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2016/09/20/ukrainian-separatist-murdered-in-moscow-restaurant-a55399) – though Russia pointedly refuses to consider that one politically motivated. \n\nLogically speaking, Galkovsky's family is next. Holmogorov, Krasovsky or Prilepin are more immediately deserving, but they're more directly state-affiliated, and thus presumably harder targets. Maybe Olshansky, Kashin and some other journalists of that sort are on the kill list. ^2\n\nI wonder if they'll come for translators. \n\nMore generally, I think this should be taken as a good message for reactionaries and conservative contrarians everywhere, TradCaths, groypers, alt/dissident-rightists of whatever is the current euphemism; all sorts of political Platonists who think and act as if the world can bend to their mind, like Dugin's sensei and alchemist Golovin taught. A very old-school, Kipling-style message, in the case QANON, Jan 6th and its consequences weren't enough for everybody over there.  \nYou're not playing games when you exercise your wordsmithing ability in public. Be cautious of your wishes coming true. This world is physical and unforgiving, an arena where sober-headed causality engineers wrestle with brute chance, emergent complexity and each other; posing as Gigachads and portraying your better-organized opponents as crying Soyjaks will earn you nothing but misery in the long run. Wars are won not with spirit and meme magic and Idealism but with boring stuff like skills, manpower, logistics and strategy. Including wars of the mind! When you fight a war, even a Culture war, it's obscene to treat it as a game.  \nAlexander Heliyevich Dugin has been playing word games all his life and got lost in their rhizomatic abyss, a perpetually edgy boy with an uncanny and uneven erudition, although adorned with a solid grey beard (by the way, he's only 60 despite his looks, a decade younger than his clean-shaven, botoxed, small-minded God-Czar; this *starchestvo*, performative embrace of the aging process, is a political statement). He has already lost more than his sanity. Most likely it'll be easier for him to spin this loss into another ^3 bitter cause for doubling down than to admit having been fundamentally wrong. Don't be like Alexander Heliyevich Dugin, if you can. The real world deserves being taken seriously.   \n\n---\n\n**1:** To make it clear: I think assassinating Dugin is fair game, though perhaps not worth the effort. He's a warmonger and he considers philosophy to be a form of combat, and the highest form at that. Indeed, the last post on his vk.com account (predating the event by half a day) begins with: \n\n&gt; Mental warfare should be handled by people with a high quality of mentality. That is, above all, philosophers. After all, we are talking about Noomakhia, **wars of the mind**. In my opinion, to put this in the context of the Defense Ministry is grotesque and absurd.  \n\nPhilosophy aside, he has always directly encouraged the violence and, what offends me more, the escapist fantasy of prevailing through the denial of «Titanism», even resorting to clear tomfoolery (On the subject of import substitution: «There will be a lot of products from Belarus. Even more than now. Including textiles and cosmetics. **And also washbasins**. But Belarus will be the State of the Empire». What?). Half a year ago, back when I was still [in denial](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/sgv76g/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_january_31/hvqh1kw/) about the impending war, he was clamoring for the ruination of Ukraine, and he deserves his label as the [intellectual father of Russian Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashism#Aleksandr_Dugin). \n\nI used to find those extreme aspects of him clownish, mere delusion of an ideologue who's been used and discarded by a corrupt bureaucratic apparatus he glamorizes. But it turns out that a clown mafia state can still try to act out esoteric fascism. Like they say: «It looked like we've punched through the rock bottom; then we've heard knocking from below». \n\n**2:** Solovyev's death would be satisfying to hear about, but [one alleged attempt](https://meduza.io/feature/2022/06/21/dva-mesyatsa-nazad-fsb-ob-yavila-o-sryve-pokusheniya-na-vladimira-solovieva) had already failed; and I'm afraid he's the type to repent, be graciously forgiven and get his assets back, proceeding to bang empty-headed Russian Studies co-eds and write cringe-inducing lit crit and mawkish memoirs until his centennial anniversary. (Then again, that's what *Westerners* can offer him; Ukrainians are a healthy Eastern European people, somewhat cruder. And they're getting into their «the only good Russian is a dead Russian» mindset deep enough to train their pitchforks on [Maxim Katz](https://youtu.be/ZMNIHvuaG8U) now).  \n\n**3:** an excerpt from Dugin's interview in *Moskovsky Komsomolets*, a rather free-wheeling outlet, titled «“Solar” Putin has defeated “Lunar” one», Mar 30: \n\n– Alexander Gellievich, I was rereading one of your interviews about the existence of two Putins. «Solar» and «Lunar.» «Solar» is [about] Crymnash (Crimea Ours), the restoration of the Eurasian empire, messianism. «Lunar» is a rational practitioner, a realist, an adherent of capitalist economy, acting with regard to the collective West. At the time, you lamented that Putin just won't commit to the «Solar» path, preferring to combine both. And how is it today – has the choice been made?\n\n– Yes, of course, the «Solar« Putin has won, and I've been saying that he would win not a year ago, but for many years in a row. I have even published a book about this, «Putin vs Putin», dedicated to the main paradox of Russian politics – it has been translated into many languages and in it I present my theory in detail. \n\nThere is an interesting author in historical science, Ernst Kantorovich, who wrote a study called «The Two Bodies of the King». It is about the fact that any great ruler is always dual. On the one hand, physically, he is certainly a man, and on the other hand, he is a historical figure, part of a continuous historical process. As a man, he can think in a certain way; but as a historical figure on which the fate of peoples and states depend, he may act very differently.  \n\nThis duality creates the deepest tension, the drama of the ruler, and is characteristic of a variety of political regimes. It does not matter whether we are dealing with democracy, as in the case of Churchill or Roosevelt, or with monarchy, as under Ivan the Terrible or Nicholas II. It is a split that arises in the soul and in the heart, in the consciousness of the ruler, when he is truly aware of his responsibility before history, when the future of humanity depends on his actions and his decisions made with reliance on himself and his destiny, on the depths of his «I».\n\nAn ordinary, normal person acts rationally, by inertia – this is what I call the «Lunar» side. He adapts to circumstances and recognizes the rules of the game, follows moral and ethical norms.\n\nThe «Solar» side, on the other hand, compels him to perform a great deed. In the image of our president this is expressed very vividly.\n\nOn the one hand, Putin is devoted to the sovereignty of Russia as a state, but on the other, rational hand I think he was well aware of the consequences of a persistent insistence on his position. In this respect, Putin's «Solar» beginning is extremely tragic, because it means struggle with the ideas and values of the West. **But Russia has crossed the Rubicon, which I am personally very happy about.**",

    "body": "Are pity and sympathy a form of power? Rather than a kind of compassion that the powerful feel toward the weak, should it be seen as a form of social capital that the powerful use to subjugate the weak?\n\nWhen you examine how much is needed to create a truly sympathetic account of something today — the domination of a social environment to trap an audience, writers and designers, publications, media, attractive spokesmen, storytellers — it reads like a veritable army. All of these “soldiers” work together to create a sympathetic portrayal of an event in the hopes of influencing opinion. If you can raise an influencer army, are you really weak? And if you are a captured audience to sympathetic messaging, are you really powerful?\n\nWe see that enemy powers fight over sympathy. Israel and the Arab world use their influence to fight over dominant sympathy. The truly weak party finds themselves at the disadvantage, lacking the prerequisite capital for strong messaging. \n\nA documentary is not a documentary[1]. A documentary is never a documentary. It’s more like a special military operation, or espionage behind enemy lines. “The Lobby” encapsulates this idea. State-owned *Al Jazeera* used (expensive) investigative journalists to uncover the lobbying efforts of Israelis in the UK and America, who ostensibly use their power to promote sympathetic portrayals of themselves and unsympathetic portrayals of their enemies. In the first series of the documentary, the Israelis keep a “hit list” of pro-Arab politicians to socially “take down”, using their social capital in the media, and accusations of oppression (anti-semitism) are brought against pro-Palestinians. And the Arabs responded by creating this documentary, a one-sided portrayal of all of the above, which lead to government inquests and the election of a Muslim student leader. In the second series, we learn that a wealthy Israeli businessman runs a website that accuses anti-Israeli activists of oppression (anti-semitism) in an attempt to, well, oppress them (shaming and blackmailing). However, this documentary never officially aired — Israel pressured Qatar to can airings of the documentary; Republican congressmen asked Jeff Sessions to label Al Jazeera a foreign agent, and the Justice Department to investigate Al Jazeera. The *Zionist Organization of America* boasted of lobbying the Qatari government to can the documentary.\n\nThis documentary was not small potatoes, as evidenced by the “exaggerated” Israeli response. But their reaction wasn’t exaggerated at all. A documentary is a weapon of sympathy, and Israel and the Arab world are fighting over control of sympathy. I question whether there is any organic sympathy left to be found that is not boosted by powerful sponsors.\n\n[1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lobby_(TV_series)",

    "body": "**Humans are not equal**. \n\nI expect most people here would probably agree with that statement reflexively, insofar as most people here probably agree that all people do not have equal capabilities, whether we’re talking about physical capabilities or the more controversial mental capabilities. \n\nHowever even most people who are quick to admit to this are just as quick to follow it up with the caveat that practical inequality does not imply *moral* inequality, and that all persons regardless of ability are worth equal moral consideration. \n\nI think this is self-evidently false. Leftists, the paladins of “equality,” understand this, which is why inegalitarian thought frightens them so much. If, in fact, humans are not practically equal, then it is self-evident that they are not morally equal, either. A dullard is worth less than a genius. It is obvious. \n\nIMO the right can never really win against the left until it defends the proposition, yes, some people are inherently better than others on all relevant metrics. \n\nIt is difficult to argue against economic redistribution, to give one example unless you accept this. To make an argument that people should not have their wealth expropriated for the sake of others, you cannot make purely practical arguments (i.e it won’t have the desired results, it’s inefficient, etc.) because this leaves one open to all sorts of moralistic sophistry. One must make the point that the intended recipients of the redistribution simply are not worthy of the goods of better people. \n\nLikewise, with the axiom of human moral equality taken for granted, right-wingers will flounder to explain why an intelligent, respected, sober, successful man deserves more consideration than a stupid, habitual drunken layabout. Sure, the former might make better decisions, but if the two share some fundamental moral equality, shouldn’t their desires, interests, and well-being merit equal consideration?\n\nTo argue for “equality of opportunity” instead of “equality of outcome” is an equally (ha) silly thing to do. What does it even mean, when one gets down to it? We haven’t sprung fully formed from the aether. We are all products of our ancestors, and the environments produced by our ancestors. There was “equality of opportunity” at the beginning of time, and we are living with its results. It’s possible someone whose ancestors are all imbecilic failures, and who lives in a community of imbecilic failures, will prove as capable (in whatever respect) as someone whose ancestors are all intelligent, competent persons, but it is unlikely enough that no resources or energy should be expended on giving that former someone “his shot.” \n\nI suspect this line of thinking viscerally would disgust and upset even a lot of people who consider themselves “right-wing.” I submit that this merely shows the extent to which even self-considered conservatives or reactionaries have been mind-colonized by leftism in the present day. For the past sixteen plus centuries of human civilization, no one ever dreamed that the life of a slave was worth the life of a free man. \n\nI would amend the first statement to, **humans are not equal in *any* sense.** Except perhaps the most banal and uninteresting sense in which two humans are equally humans, in the same sense that a boulder and a pebble are equally rocks. Conceding “equality” in any sense other than this plants the seed of a thousand errors.",

    "body": "An [interesting article from Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/08/19/fallout-mar-a-lago-search-00052799) today on how the Mar-a-Lago search's real fallout has been another step towards widescale civil breakdown. \n\n&gt;The political consequences of the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago, former president Donald Trump’s Florida residence, have been shrill but predictable. Most Democrats have welcomed it as gratification long delayed, Trump loyalists have condemned it as a “Deep State” abuse of power, and more measured Republicans have split the difference. Observers have also pointed to the danger of riling up Trump’s base and stoking his determination to retake the presidency.\n\nThere were attacks against the far right before, like the siege of Waco during the 90s, and right-wing counterattacks like the Oklahoma city bombing. But it mostly stopped there, as the Oklahoma bombing had a chilling effect that delegitimized political violence among the mainstream right. Soon enough, 9/11 turned the focus of domestic terrorism towards Muslims for much of the 2000s and 2010s, but as divisions are growing deeper between the right and left the specter of rightwing extremism is returning:\n\n&gt;For one, there’s the newfound legitimacy of domestic political violence. In the 1990s, the militia movement was merely percolating, committed to resisting government but not interested in taking the offensive or prepared to do so. Mainstream American liberals and conservatives both firmly considered domestic political violence unacceptable. Only conspicuous law-enforcement debacles could inspire even an extremist like McVeigh to lethal terrorist action against fellow Americans. Today, though, Blue and Red are arguably irreconcilable, and Trump has hauled the far right to the surface and enlisted it in his personal service. Some of his supporters are so convinced that his presidency was stolen from him that they apprehend the subdued, circumspect, non-violent execution of a search warrant on his residence as a casus belli, and authoritative and admired figures encourage them to do so.\n\n&gt;Steve Bannon labeled the FBI a “gestapo.” Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene called for Congress to defund the FBI. Far-right pundits have proclaimed “This. Means. War.” and characterized the search as a “declaration of war.” Posts on far-right internet forums have been more violent than any since January 6. Last weekend, armed Trump supporters clad in body armor held a protest outside the FBI’s Phoenix office. Threats against federal law enforcement have spiked, intensifying a growing trend. Some extremists have “doxxed” FBI agents, publicizing their personal information to enable others to harass them or target them with violence. Such behavior seems intended to mobilize those of McVeigh’s ilk.\n\nThe growth of militias has further catalyzed this process. In the 90s militias were atomized, but with the advent of social media they've been able to talk and coordinate with each other much more effectively. They've stockpiled more weapons as well, with lax gun laws in red states. Departments like the ATF have responded in turn, buying up military-grade gear to turn previously routine operations into SWAT-style force protection. There's also concerns within the ATF and FBI that many agents are sympathetic to the plight of the far right, and there's anecdotal evidence that there were tensions within the FBI due to the Mar-a-Lago raid. Risks of a new civil war are overstated, as the geographic distribution of reds vs blues doesn't really lend itself to secession. However, risks of a Troubles-like insurgency are very real:\n\n&gt;Mature democracies have gone too far in the past. In 1969, the British government sent troops to Northern Ireland to quell growing community unrest over Catholic nationalist political and civil rights protests. The soldiers were initially welcomed as peacekeepers. But as grievances could not be immediately addressed and protests escalated, the British government resorted to more extreme measures, including direct armed confrontation, mass internment of those suspected of paramilitary activities, the statutory establishment of “scheduled offenses” for political violence, and the creation of dedicated, non-jury courts for trying those charged with them. The IRA exploited this too, orchestrating marches and demonstrations that would prompt the Royal Ulster Constabulary to break out the riot gear, which served to confirm their narrative of state oppression, generate sympathetic headlines and news spots, and win recruits to the armed struggle. Eventually, the public came to see IRA militants as soldiers in a civil war. By the mid-1970s, London understood that demilitarization and normalization would make the conflict more tractable, but by then the gouge was set: the Troubles would last 25 years, extend violence to the British mainland, and palsy Northern Irish society.\n\nWhat does the motte think about preventing the coming civil breakdown?",

It's clear to me that there are people who *like AI*, and there are people who *don't like AI*.

I'm pretty sure it's been years at this point since I first heard about AI composing pieces in the style of Bach and Beethoven, and I didn't like that stuff when I first heard about it either.  It rubs me the wrong way.\n\nNor can opposition to AI be reduced to simple technological luddism, or a knee-jerk preference for what is familiar over what is new and unfamiliar.  I am not opposed to all technological progress on principle - I welcome the advent of interstellar travel, and the curing of diseases like cancer and ALS.  Conversely, I am skeptical of technologies that have been a familiar part of my life since childhood.  I can hardly remember a time when I didn't have access to the internet, and yet my feelings towards it are mixed at best.  It's a double edged sword - it has brought many great things, but also many terrible things.  If I could somehow freeze publicly-available internet access at a level of development comparable to the late 90s, I probably would.  But that's another story.\n\nIt's not hard to enumerate factors that I *incidentally* find distasteful about AI art - that it will flood the world with a glut of low-effort content, that it will inflate the egos of people who think they are \"artists\" when they are in fact nothing of the sort, that it will discourage people from developing genuine creativity because it will be easier to settle for a half-hearted, inauthentic substitute - but I think that none of these considerations truly strike at the heart of the issue for me.  My intuition is that there is something deeper going on, something that can be related to the culture war, because I think I can see familiar patterns from the culture war repeating themselves.\n\nMy highly speculative thesis is that people who like AI are motivated by an *aesthetics of success*, and people who don't like AI are motivated by an *aesthetics of failure*, or a tragic aesthetics.  These positions also correspond in a very loose way to the left/right divide, respectively.  I'll try to explain what I mean.\n\nTraditionally, leftism since Marx was founded in a belief in utopian progress - that we could resolve social problems through willful, rational action, ultimately culminating in a terminal optimal social order that was free of contradictions, or as Marx put it, \"the riddle of history solved\".  Now, it's possible to claim that modern (or even classic) leftism is not about this at all, and that it's actually a thinly disguised form of ethnic warfare.  That may be true.  But even so, you can't deny that this utopian impulse did exist in and continues to inform leftism, and more importantly, people who *enjoy* this vision of the future, people who find it *aesthetically* pleasing, people who hear the idea of an optimal non-contradictory social order and think \"hey that sounds like a good idea\", tend to be drawn to leftism.\n\nThe same utopian impulse from Marxism also underlies the transhumanism of, for example, Yudkowsky's [Fun Theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K4aGvLnHvYgX9pZHS/the-fun-theory-sequence).  The idea (as far as I can tell from lightly skimming it) is that we could construct a perfect reality that satisfies every constraint we could ever wish to optimize for - it's exactly as exciting as we need, exactly as pleasant as we need, exactly as challenging as we need, and if for some reason you wish to meet a tragic end where you fail to fulfill all your goals, well hey we can arrange for that too.  It is logically perfect in every way - no one is excluded, no one could ask for more, even the people whose very wish is to be excluded from the utopia.  I think the relation between this kind of transhumanism on the one hand, and the development of AI on the other, is pretty obvious - if you enjoy, on an aesthetic level, the idea of a perfect transhumanist future, then you probably also enjoy on an aesthetic level when AI smashes through fundamental human limitations.\n\nI am *in no way* saying that everyone who gets warm fuzzies for AI and transhumanism is a leftist.  Certainly we have many counterexamples on this forum.  Nor does every leftist like the idea of AI - there are plenty of leftist artists complaining on twitter about AI art as we speak.  But I do think that leftists and people who like AI are aligned on this general pro-utopian axis - they agree that a utopian future is fundamentally desirable, even if they disagree on implementation details, and many other contemporary political issues besides.\n\nThe key thing to understand about the other side, the opposition to this utopian ideal, is that *not everyone thinks that utopia is desirable*.  Some of us consciously reject it.  I mean this in a very deep way, as deep as you can possibly conceive.  I mean that even in the most logically perfect utopia you can imagine, one where everyone gets the exact amount of challenge and pain and tragedy that is suited to them, one where I can live in my tragic broken reality and you can live in your blissful nice one and we can somehow coexist simultaneously - *I still don't want that*.  I don't want reality to be like that.  I don't want reality to be at peace.  I want there to be failure in the very nature of things.  I want us to never reach a final state of peace, even if there is fire and brimstone built into that overarching peace.\n\nFrom Zizek's \"Less Than Nothing\":\n\n&gt;It is true that one finds in Hegel a systematic drive to cover everything, to propose an account of all phenomena in the universe in their essential structure; but this drive does not mean that Hegel strives to locate every phenomenon within a harmonious global edifice; on the contrary, the point of dialectical analysis is to demonstrate how every phenomenon, everything that happens, fails in its own way, implies a crack, antagonism, imbalance, in its very heart.  Hegel's gaze upon reality is that of a Roentgen apparatus which sees in everything that is alive the traces of its future death.\n\nI find this to be an immensely aesthetically pleasing passage - it's how I want reality to be.  I imagine that transhumanists will not feel as warmly towards it (although this is an empirical hypothesis that is subject to refutation through counterexamples).  To you, there is beauty in triumph; problems are meant to be solved, and then quietly and safely set aside, conquered, dealt with.  You want to [resolve on the I chord](https://youtu.be/6aezSL_GvZA?t=430).  We won, you say; there's no need to go backwards now.  Man stands victorious at the summit of his knowledge.  You thought we couldn't make a machine that paints beautiful pictures?  Well, we did it.  We put the sum total of man's visual knowledge into a machine.  That's what we were able to accomplish; our triumph over this domain is total.  The beauty of our actions is measured by the strength of the gods we have slain.\n\nTo me, there is beauty in failure - no problem ever fully solved, no debate ever put to rest, no point of finality ever reached.  Not because there is an angry God who will slap us down if we exceed our station, but because *failure is built into the very nature of things*.  The moment of triumph becomes the moment of defeat, not due to any external force, but because of the necessity of its own inner movement.  Reality as a demonic house of mirrors where every moment of recognition is the moment of misrecognition, every realization comes too late that the act of will was actually the ultimate act of self-sabotage - this is reality as I *aesthetically* want it to be.  Doesn't mean it is.  But it's what I want - it's what I like.  And our likes and dislikes are awfully important when it comes to motivating our actions.\n\nHopefully there's something here to discuss.\n\n&gt;Out of love for mankind... I conceived it as my task to create difficulties everywhere.\n\n- Kierkegaard",

NYSED and local school districts have large financial incentives to graduate as many students as possible. These incentives were put in place by both federal and state legislators who meant well and were trying to encourage good public school performance (good performance == graduation, of course, in their eyes). Teachers and principals have large quality-of-life incentives to pass students. Failing students brings scrutiny, parent and student complaints, superintendent pressure, guidance counselor inquisitions, paperwork, and meeting after meeting. It’s much easier to pass everyone.\n\nTL;DR: The criteria on an exam needed to graduate from high school in New York have been lowered to the point that it can be passed by someone who barely attended class.\n\nI first saw this on /r/slatestarcodex. In [the comments](https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/wro3vz/guessing_c_for_every_answer_is_now_enough_to_pass), someone asked why the SAT wasn't more widely used by universities and employers, given that it is more standardized and objective.

    "body": "**Culture war in Finland: Stupidest day in Finnish politics for a long time**\n\nCONTEXT: It's not a new thing that Finnish PM Sanna Marin, 36, has been frequently seen out and about, drinking and dancing in clubs and such. Of course it's not a new thing for Finnish politicians to use alcohol or even get into accidents and such while doing so, but this is the new era and everyone has smartphones.\n\nPreviously the [major affair was in December](https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-finlands-prime-minister-sanna-marin-apologises-for-going-clubbing-after-coronavirus-exposure-12490903), when she was out late in a Helsinki club even though she had been exposed to Covid and there were still Covid restrictions for various things; even though the restrictions didn't affect what she, specifically, was doing, it was considered improper. On these evenings she's been spotted with an entourage of local pop stars and other celebs.\n\nAnyway, last week, she was at one of the major music festivals in Finland, Flow Festival - not the biggest, but a classic hipster festival and certainly \"upscale\" - and had pics taken [with the attending celebs](https://is.mediadelivery.fi/img/468/7089604209104a472752cf1aa503aeb2.jpg). This caused some tut-tutting about behaving immaturely during great crises in Europe and the world. Whatever.\n\nNow it turns out that one of the members of her entourage took a [video of being a drunk party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C-djV-ptEM) with her entourage and posted it on IG - private account for 92 people, to be sure, but of course something like that's going to get out. The video started spreading yesterday, and the entirety of today has consisted on Finnish social and traditional media obsessing about the clip, specifically about the specific charges of whether her entourage uses cocaine.\n\nOf course PM partying in an entourage that's on drugs would be scandal in other countries, too, whether they took coke personally or not, but Finland tends to currently be particularly conservative on drugs compared to other Western countries - even pot decriminalization is not really soemthing that most would be consider to be short-term achievable.\n\nHard drugs are, of course a whole other question. I haven't used anything stronger than pot in my life and it's been years since I've even smoked, but my understanding is that coke has been a facet of celebrity life at some level. However, it's only recent years when it has really hit the scene in Helsinki. Usually, the hard drug of choice for Finns has been speed.\n\nNow, none of the celebrities are actually snorting anything up their nose in the video, so what's the evidence for drug use? Well, apart from the fact that they're, ya know, smiling and having fun and so on in the video (Finns might drink alcohol, but we do it to get drunk, not to actually have fun), at some parts of the video, some of them shout \"Fuck it, this makes me feel good\" in reference to something unseen and the word that might be \"jauhojengi\" (\"flour gang\") or something else. Also, some claim that some of the pixels in the video indeed make it look like there's coke on the table. (Others claim it's a phone.) One particular claim is even that people on the video must be on drugs since there are so few bottles or glasses seen.\n\n\"Flour gang\" has instantly became a meme here, even though it's now unclear 1. whether \"flour\" is actually Finnish drug lingo, or whether it has ever been used to refer to powder drugs here by anyone and 2. whether the words \"jauhojengi\" are actually used - the video features people dancing to and singing washed-up pop rapper Petri Nygård's lyrics for the old hit song \"Selvä päivä\" (\"Sober day\"), which is about, as you might guess, drinking. (You can find [translated lyrics](https://lyricstranslate.com/en/selv%C3%A4-p%C3%A4iv%C3%A4-sober1-day.html) here if you really wish.) The word heard as \"jauho\" might well instead be a reference to \"jallu\", or Jaloviina, an iconic Finnish booze brand that's 50 % brandy and 50 % vodka and features in a metric ton of local music.\n\nSeveral medias took the whole \"flour gang\" thing and ran with it, probably one reason being that earlier in the week they were criticized for going too easy on Marin and her government. Now others are attacking media for pushing a theory originally spread (at least on Twitter) by conspiracy theorist accounts that have otherwise taken a pro-Russian narratie. Yes, there are even references to whole thing being a Russian disinfo campaign.\n\nMarin has herself [had to comment on this](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-finnish-pm-sanna-marin-says-no-drugs-just-lots-of-dancing-at-wild/), saying that she is disappointed in the video leaking, that she only had mild alcoholic drinks and doesn't use drugs and that she's willing to even take a drug test (not that it would show cocaine use anyway, more than a few days having passed from the party). Of course it still might turn out one or more of the celeb entourage members have been on drugs, who knows?\n\nAll in all, it would probably be the best if the PM quit back on partying or at least chose better friends to avoid embarassing stuff leaking out (also, you know, for general security reasons), the first rule of the Flour Gang is to never talk about the Flour Gang, PMs should find better music to dance to than a local whiteboy 50 Cent and politics here can indeed be as dumb as anywhere else, especially with the social media and stuff.",

Can empathy be turned off on purpose? These are but a small sampling of the questions I've asked myself, and I don't have answers. I don't know what empathy is, but I know 1. I have less of it than most people do, if I even have it at all and 2. a lot of people have empathy only when it's convenient. I waffle on whether people in my outgroup/people whose outgroup includes me are particularly unempathetic, or whether my cognitive bias just makes me think that they are.\n\nI've tried to understand this concept of empathy not because I think it's important to understand, but because the word \"empathy\" gets tossed around a lot and I'd like to know how to interpret it. Maybe it's one of those words like \"racism\" or \"woke\" that has no precise definition and is, at best, a direction.\n\nAs a rule, I don't like seeing people suffer. However, when someone is suffering, I cannot say I feel their pain, because I'm not them. I only know what it's like to be me and have the particular experiences that I've had. The closest I can get to putting myself in the place of another person is thinking back to an experience I've had that made me feel a certain way and acting as though that's exactly how my interlocutor feels. That's not empathy, but an approximation. The way people describe empathy makes it sound like a superpower, like mind reading.

This is a fairly interesting omission from the forum in its own right as this forum has at least traditionally had a strong SF Tech overlap. \n\nBut for those who didn't get the story, Tornado cash is a new Smart Contract that is intended to obscure the block-chain addresses used in transactions by bundling them together to obfuscate any single transaction. The US Treasury blacklisted the coin blacklisted and declared it illegal for Americans to own or use following it being used to funnel money to North Korea [see: https://nitter.net/RyanSAdams/status/1558129960140816384#m, https://www.pcmag.com/news/tornado-cash-developer-arrested-as-blacklisted-crypto-site-goes-down, https://www.foxbusiness.com/financials/dutch-authorities-arrest-suspected-developer-tornado-cash-platform-launder-billions]. \n\nDutch authorities (Pertsev is Dutch) have claimed to have an independent investigation and the arrest was for concealing criminal financial flows and money laundering on behalf of the Dutch prosecutor's office.

I beg forgiveness on that.\n\nThe article basically analyzes the conservative claim on social media from last week that the 87,000 tax collectors in the Inflation Reduction Act would be used to attack poor people. While the maps seem to indicate that, and further seem more specifically to be targeting *non-white people*, the truth of the matter is more nuanced. The audits are disproportionately attacking folks who file the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) due presumptively to some systemic flagging mechanism within the IRS. And since that's a measure specifically for poor people, their audits also predominantly hit poor people.\n\nPart of this has to do with changes in staffing. They have more low grade \"tax examiners\" and fewer higher grade \"revenue agents,\" and the examiners are largely issuing \"correspondence audits\" which are simpler things which basically just demand more information. But since they're demanding them from poorer folks who may not have all the information or understand the cryptic language the correspondence audits are issued in, targeting them pumps the enforcement numbers up and makes the auditors look good.\n\nSo now if we set that on a shelf and examine one of the more popular definitions of \"systemic racism\" (Socioeconomic and government systems which produce differential racial outcomes) then it is apparent that the IRS's EITC flagging criteria are a result of a \"racist system\" because it fits the definition in use.\n\nWhether this provision within the Inflation Reduction Act itself then qualifies as \"racist\" will in the end depend on whether the $80 billion earmark in the law includes a way to fix the racist system, or whether it will just be thrown at increasing operations as they currently exist, in which case the EITC audits will just increase.\n\nArticle has numerous charts, maps, and references.",

    "body": "I've noticed an interesting shift among the progressive movement lately. I think there's starting to be a recognition that the fervor and policies born in 2020 were fairly flawed, as evidenced by the legacy of ideas like defund the police, and elections in fairly left areas in which people rejected the progressive candidates in places like NYC, NJ, VA, and SF (the [SF one](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/chesa-boudin-recall-san-francisco-crime/629907/) in particular is interesting. Chesa Boudin really served as a microcosm of progressivism who was given free reign, as were the city council elections that took place around the same time, thus his election served to some extent as a referendum on progressivism).\n\nBut what's interesting is that progressives, in self reflecting and having to analyze why this has occurred, have blamed progressive white people. And to a considerable degree the same thing has been occurring with respect to the policies corporations instituted during 2020. Which is so crazy to me. On the one hand, I agree and find overeducated white progressives who come from wealthy families to be among the most insufferable demographics. But on the other, their only real crime is that they listened to what was being demanded of them, that they be allies and use their supposed privilege to advance the views of anti-racists. It's kind of like they're being told \"Lol you thought we were serious with all of that stuff? What the fuck is wrong with you?\" It sort of validates the view that anti-racists have anti-white undercurrents. Like if they did unambiguously have anti-white undercurrents, how would they respond to the recognition of the ideological excesses of 2020? They would blame white people. Like if you’re a white progressive and want to support movements and ideas like that, at this point I don’t know what the fuck you’re supposed to do. If you don’t support it you’re part of the problem as identified by people you agree with, and if you do support it you’re going to be the scape goat when shit goes south and it becomes clear that the policies you supported to advance the ends you were told to advance were deeply flawed.\n\nI think it also reveals a lack of strategy on the part of people working to advance those ideas, even within their own paradigm. Their view is that white people wield disproportionately more institutional power than non-white people do, so if that’s true you would want those people with outsized power and who agree with you to use that power to advance your ends. But instead they are condemning them and de-incentivizing their participation. It just seems very counterintuitive.\n\nI think it really comes down to the fact that activists are insatiable. when they’re actually given the reins, asked what exactly they want, and allowed to implement policies, they don’t actually know. or if they do have proposals it's always impractically radical stuff that only makes sense to the small group of people who agree with them like just razing institutions and starting over or defunding the police or something equally as bizzare. it reminds me a lot of the occupy wall street people. They’re the dog that caught the car. They aren’t there to actually catch the car, they’re there to chase the car. implementing the change that they desire requires an understanding of things as they are (you have to understand the problem before you can develop a solution), but activists’ characteristic commitment to ideology precludes them from interpreting the world or developing solutions that go even a bit outside the scope of their ideology. Like can anyone seriously envision a series of events and policies that would have caused BLM to be like 'welp. that's pretty much what we were asking for. you did it and solved the problem. guess we can just pack up our shit and go home.' like even over the course of their ideas being implemented over 10 years I can't envision that occurring. \n\nProgressive activists are the dog that caught the car, and once they caught the car and fucked it away they blamed it on the person who served as the distraction that slowed the car down and opened the door for the dog to do what it wanted to do. I think this is indicative of intellectual rot and my view is that to some extent the movement has been exposed and they sorta blew it when they had the spotlight.",
