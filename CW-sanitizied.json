    "body": "# Why do so many people dislike capitalism?\n\nAnd I'm not saying in this post that there are no good arguments about capitalism, I'm only trying to understand the *modal* argument against capitalism.\n\nI think people inherently don't like being told what to do. When someone compels you to do something, chances are it benefits them more than it benefits you, so we have an automatic reflex to assume that we're being shortchanged.\n\nThe weird thing is, when you look around at modern society, there's no one entity that really tells you what to do. If you don't like your job, you can quit at any time and no one will make you keep working. But then, if you don't have any job, you'll probably have to live on the street and that's not pleasant, so if you want to live a normal life you'll have to find *someone* who has money and convince them to give it to you.\n\nThe system that coordinates this is capitalism, so indirectly, the market forces of capitalism are telling everyone what to do. That inherently makes people dislike it, I think. You can ask yourself \"why am I doing something I hate every day?\" and trace the causal chain back and eventually you'll get to \"because capitalism\". That's probably not going to endear someone to capitalism!\n\nPeople won't say it explicitly, and it feels like of strawmannish to say out loud, but I genuinely think maybe 50% people who say things like \"fuck capitalism\" are imagining in their heads \"Capitalism makes everyone have to do stuff they hate all day and most people don't even get paid that much money for it. Wouldn't it be great if there were a system where nobody had to work and we still had our modern living standards?\"\n\nThrough this lens, a lot of arguments that seemed weird to me started to make sense.\n\n1. The subreddit /r/antiwork. Enough said I think. Some people say that their real goal is just \"workplace reform\" or something like that, but I think that's just the motte. \n2. [Leftie youtube PhilTube made a video about \"bullshit jobs\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_X-812q_Jc). If you're not familiar, [bullshit jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) says that half of all work people do in the developed world is pointless. If you look at his examples, like \"programmers repairing bloated code\", I think you'll find this assertion a bit questionable. But you can understand why it's a very tempting idea: if half of jobs are completely pointless, that means everyone could work 20 hours a week instead of 40 with no loss in productivity! \n3. There's of course the preference for small businesses over megacorps. When a mom and pop shop hires you to work the register, that's not capitalism making you do it, that's just mom and pop asking you to do something for them and paying you for your time. They're probably giving you a good deal, right? But when Amazon hires you to work in the warehouse, even if they pay better than mom and pop and offer better benefits, suddenly is some weird foreign global system that's getting you to work for them. They're probably ripping you off!\n\nAgain, to be clear, I'm not saying there are no good arguments against capitalism or anything like that. I think it's okay to look at bad arguments for position X, as long as you don't come away from that process thinking that those are representative of the best arguments for position X.",

    "body": "In the UK the Tories are having a new leadership election. For one reason or another a lot of minority candidates are in the race and people are talking about it. Much of it is presented as a reply to lawyer, full time virtue signalling tweeter, and [fox killer](https://barristerblogger.com/2019/12/26/should-jolyon-maugham-be-prosecuted-for-bludgeoning-a-fox-to-death/) Jolyon Maugham.\n\n[This article](https://www.thenational.scot/news/20267870.jolyon-maugham-sparks-racism-debate-deleted-tweet-sunak/) covers the origin. \n\n[Of course the Conservative Party could choose an ethnic minority leader](https://capx.co/of-course-the-conservative-party-could-choose-an-ethnic-minority-leader/) says Sunder Katwala\n\n&gt; That ethnic minorities can reach the top of the political ladder matters – but it would certainly not make either Britain or the Conservative party a post-racial nirvana. While it will take more to shift the Conservatives’ share of the ethnic minority vote, the leadership contest sends a powerful symbolic message about the race to the top. The next challenge will be to develop the substantive agenda to deliver on that promise.\n\n[In a more humourous article about poorly air conditioned leadership speeches](https://archive.ph/8pIpT#selection-1559.0-1559.144) Tim Stanley remarks \n\n&gt; Actually, I think historians will write that the two notable things about this race were, one, it was incredibly diverse and, two, nobody cared.\n\nRakib Eshan says [The left’s problem with diversity](https://www.spiked-online.com/2022/07/11/the-lefts-problem-with-diversity/)\n\n&gt; The left’s unhealthy obsession with racial identity and ethnic heritage can only do more harm than good. Treating ethnic-minority people not as individuals but as representatives of ethnic groups will only undermine our multi-ethnic democracy.\n\n&gt; Beyond the identitarian game-playing, Britain is grappling with myriad social and economic problems. From the cost-of-living crisis to the endless backlogs in the NHS, the Tories have left numerous open goals for the opposition. The classic conservative message, that family stability and hard work can insulate people from harsh economic conditions, sounds tin-eared at best amid the current crises. These are the bread-and-butter domestic issues that Tory leadership candidates should be challenged on. But instead, the Conservatives’ opponents have been reduced to race-baiting playground behaviour.\n\nTomiwa Owolade writes for the New Statesman [It’s absurd to say the Conservative Party isn’t ready for a non-white leader](https://www.newstatesman.com/quickfire/2022/07/its-absurd-to-say-the-conservative-party-isnt-ready-for-a-non-white-leader)\n\n&gt; But the third and most pressing point is this: why shouldn’t an ethnic minority person be a Conservative? If we accept that not all ethnic minority people are the same – which should be the first plank of anti-racism – then we have to accept that they do not all share the same political perspective. And nor should they. Political pluralism should be staunchly defended: it is as important an element of diversity as any other.\n\n--------------------\n\nI'd sum up the whole debate like this:\n\n* The left know the Tories are doing better than Labour on diversity at the top so they're keeping quiet.\n* The right don't care that much, and are mostly talking about taxes and cost of living. (Except Kemi Badenoch whose mostly talking about free speech and culture) But are willing to take a bit of a victory lap to indulge themselves. \n* While everyone writing about this topic is by definition engaging in culture wars. I think you can say that people who mention the fox are more tribal than people who don't.",

    "body": "[Noah Smith on how Shinzo Abe is not the man the West paints him to be.](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/abe-shinzo-a-retrospective) Some excerpts:\n\n**Economic Policy**\n\n&gt;But most important of all was the shift in the economic role of women. Before Abe, Japan had persistently lagged in terms of women’s labor force participation, especially among mothers. The country’s sexism was legendary and entrenched. When Abe came to power at the end of 2012, I definitely did not expect him to change this — during his brief, abortive first tenure as PM, his health minister caused a national scandal by referring to women as “birth-giving machines”. Abe’s reputation as a staunch cultural conservative seemed to presage more business-as-usual.  \nBut it was not business-as-usual. As soon as he got into office for the second time, Abe began to talk up the importance of women in the workforce, and to implement some real policies toward this end as well. By 2014, it was clear to me that the national dialogue around the issue had shifted.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The key number we were all keeping an eye on here was women’s labor force participation, which surpassed the number for the United States for the first time in 2017.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So on macroeconomic policy and structural reform, Abe really delivered in a way that I didn’t expect him to. And the results were clear — falling unemployment despite a flood of new workers into the labor force, record profits for small and medium sized businesses, and modestly rising incomes despite rapid aging and a growth in the old-age dependency ratio.\n\n**Surprisingly Liberal**\n\n&gt;But by the second time Abe took power, his approach had changed. Abe visited Yasukuni Shrine — where the ashes of several Japanese war criminals are kept — once at the beginning of his term in office, but did not do so afterwards. This was in contrast to his mentor Koizumi Junichiro, who had made annual visits when he was Prime Minister in the 2000s. That was the first hint that Abe was behaving in a less overtly nationalist manner in his second term.  \nIn 2015, Abe reversed his previous denialist stance on the issue of Korean “comfort women” (WW2-era sex slaves), issuing a formal apology and explicitly laying the blame on the Japanese military for the first time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But Abe’s most liberal actions came in an area that’s not (yet) a hot-button issue in Japan — immigration. Under Abe, Japan opened itself up to immigration in a way that it never has before, with a “guest worker” program that offered a path to permanent residence, and a fast-track permanent residency program for skilled workers. The number of foreigners living and working and settling down in Japan soared.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The anti-racist wave that beat back the racists online was present in the real world too — anti-racist counter-protesters showed up to shout down the hateful Zaitokukai, usually outnumbering them by a huge margin. Of course, Abe doesn’t get credit for that activism, but unlike Donald Trump — who spent a lot of time attacking “antifa” and ran cover for racist demonstrators — Abe and his administration focused on cracking down on the racists. That kind of leadership makes a difference.  \nOn almost every issue of race and nationhood, therefore, Abe — in his second term — behaved as the polar opposite of Donald Trump. He opened up his country to immigration, tourism, and trade, apologized for past misdeeds, made overtures to old enemies, and cracked down on racism.",

    "body": "We talked quite a bit about the quality of information in the media ecosystem and how that has intersected with science of questionable quality in the Covid universe, but today I want to highlight an example that's generally a bit further from the culture war. Over the weekend, my NYT digest pinged me with the now one year old wellness article *[Do We Really Need to Take 10,000 Steps a Day for Our Health?](https://archive.ph/Xq0Fv#selection-319.0-322.0)*. As someone that's immediately triggered by people looking for excuses to justify their sedentary lifestyles, I naturally clicked through for a quick rage-read (put aside for a moment how unhealthy *that* behavior is). So, what's the origin of the claim that fewer steps is actually fine?\n\n&gt;A 2019 study by Dr. Lee and her colleagues found that women in their 70s who managed as few as 4,400 steps a day reduced their risk of premature death by about 40 percent, compared to women completing 2,700 or fewer steps a day. The risks for early death continued to drop among the women walking more than 5,000 steps a day, but benefits plateaued at about 7,500 daily steps. In other words, older women who completed fewer than half of the mythic 10,000 daily steps tended to live substantially longer than those who covered even less ground.\n\nWait, *what*? How does this causal inference chain work? If you showed me [that study](https://archive.ph/3Xcuo), I'd think it's fine as far as it goes, but that the only thing that it really tells us is that elderly women that have dropped to as few as 2,700 steps are often pretty well on death's door, which is what I would have already expected. There's pretty much nothing I can draw from that regarding the value of moving more for young and middle-aged people. There definitely isn't anything strong enough to move me off the prior that moving more is almost always a good thing. I suppose I agree that there's no magic number and if there was, it'd be a hell of a coincidence that it happened to line up with a shiny, round number, but that's never really been the point anyway. Oh well though, she's not done citing evidence:\n\n&gt;Another, more expansive study last year of almost 5,000 middle-aged men and women of various ethnicities likewise found that 10,000 steps a day are not a requirement for longevity. In that study, people who walked for about 8,000 steps a day were half as likely to die prematurely from heart disease or any other cause as those who accumulated 4,000 steps a day. The statistical benefits of additional steps were slight, meaning it did not hurt people to amass more daily steps, up to and beyond the 10,000-steps mark. But the extra steps did not provide much additional protection against dying young, either.\n\nWell, that's a bit more encouraging, so [what does that study say](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2763292)? \n\n&gt;A total of 4840 participants (mean age, 56.8 years; 2435 [54%] women; 1732 [36%] individuals with obesity) wore accelerometers for a mean of 5.7 days for a mean of 14.4 hours per day. The mean number of steps per day was 9124. There were 1165 deaths over a mean 10.1 years of follow-up, including 406 CVD and 283 cancer deaths. The unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality was 76.7 per 1000 person-years (419 deaths) for the 655 individuals who took less than 4000 steps per day; 21.4 per 1000 person-years (488 deaths) for the 1727 individuals who took 4000 to 7999 steps per day; 6.9 per 1000 person-years (176 deaths) for the 1539 individuals who took 8000 to 11 999 steps per day; and 4.8 per 1000 person-years (82 deaths) for the 919 individuals who took at least 12 000 steps per day. Compared with taking 4000 steps per day, taking 8000 steps per day was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.44-0.55]), as was taking 12 000 steps per day (HR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.28-0.45]). Unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality by peak 30 cadence was 32.9 per 1000 person-years (406 deaths) for the 1080 individuals who took 18.5 to 56.0 steps per minute; 12.6 per 1000 person-years (207 deaths) for the 1153 individuals who took 56.1 to 69.2 steps per minute; 6.8 per 1000 person-years (124 deaths) for the 1074 individuals who took 69.3 to 82.8 steps per minute; and 5.3 per 1000 person-years (108 deaths) for the 1037 individuals who took 82.9 to 149.5 steps per minute. Greater step intensity was not significantly associated with lower mortality after adjustment for total steps per day (eg, highest vs lowest quartile of peak 30 cadence: HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.65-1.27]; P value for trend = .34).\n\nOK, this is actually pretty good. It's still more in the direction of predictive data than advice (IMO), but those differences are *really* large. We should be looking at that and describing dropping to 4,000 steps per day in middle age as an emergency, a strong predictor of impending doom. This doesn't necessarily provide advice for the young, but we can probably start drawing some inferences about just how bad it is to not move around much. Of note, the 12,000 step group actually did a decent bit better than the 8,000 step group; they have overlapping confidence intervals, so that's a weak conclusion, but I'd personally be inclined to take it as a suggestion that we don't really have any cap on the \"more is better\" line of thinking. What's the conclusion from our intrepid NYT reporter?\n\n&gt;The good news is that upping our current step counts by even a few thousand additional strides most days could be a reasonable, sufficient — and achievable — goal, Dr. Lee said. The formal physical activity guidelines issued by the United States and other governments use time, not steps, as a recommendation, and suggest we exercise for at least 150 minutes a week, or a half-hour most days, in addition to any moving around we do as part of our normal, daily lives. Translated into step counts, Dr. Lee said, that total would work out to a little more than 16,000 steps a week of exercise for most people, or about 2,000 to 3,000 steps most days. (Two thousand steps equal approximately a mile.) If, like many people, we currently take about 5,000 steps a day during the course of everyday activities like shopping and housework, adding the extra 2,000 to 3,000 steps would take us to a total of between 7,000 and 8,000 steps most days, which, Dr. Lee said, seems to be the step-count sweet spot.\n\nWait, *what*? How is that the \"sweet spot\"? Is this based on the idea that it's some unbearable suffering to go for a long walk? I'm just absolutely blown away that anyone would treat 10,000 steps as (implied above) unreasonable and unachievable. Just how low of a bar are we setting and why is that the tone that a NYT blogger wants to set for people?\n\nOn one level, I know I'm being petty, but I actually do think misunderstanding causality and failing to actually look at the data in a couple pretty simple papers highlights just how bad science and medical journalism is. It's not just politically charged topics like Covid and environmentalism, it's something as simple as, \"should people be advised to take more than 8,000 steps?\". When the writing is this bad on something that I wouldn't expect bias to creep in, I find that I'm unsurprised that it goes completely off the rails on topics where there's a tribal affiliation with morally good conclusions.",
