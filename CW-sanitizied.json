    "body": "a theory for why violent crime might be going up.\n\nI'm sure there are a variety of factors contributing here, but one that I think is probably a relevant is that violent crime is [disproportionately](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/revcoa18.pdf) committed by black people, so focusing on arresting violent offenders would necessarily result in disproportionately arresting black people. Or perhaps that black people received longer sentences under the current government \n in the event that violent offenders tend to get longer sentences.  No one lobbying for the progressive, or perhaps even black, vote wants to be the focus of a headline saying that arrests of black people increased under their leadership. Conversations surrounding equity are simply not nuanced enough for the politician to be able to counter that there's more to it than those statistics, that it's just because they focused more on violent crime so people who commit violent crime were arrested at higher rates. And this could also explain why violent crime rates have gone up more in blue cities on a per capita basis. \n\nI just wanna say, I hate to be the guy to bring this point up. I'm not just out here looking to take jabs like this, so if there is anything I'm missing, definitely let me know.\n\nMy ultimate point is that I have to imagine politicians on the left looking for votes are not unaware of this reasoning.",

    "body": "It blows my mind how thoroughly Trump’s 2016 campaign has been forgotten. What I mean is that Trump effectively ran on a single issue in 2016: immigration. He was going to “build the wall and deport them all.” That’s why he was elected, not because of “wokeness,” or “liberal elites,” or to end foreign wars or whatever. \n\nAnd yet that’s been almost entirely forgotten in the years since. Trump’s presidency was a resounding failure on the anti-immigration front, so maybe that’s why. \n\nBut for whatever reason, today immigration has fallen almost completely by the wayside compared to 2016. On both sides. The daily “Trump bad” pieces in the media are rarely about immigrants anymore, they’re about Trump’s “erosion of democratic norms” or SCOTUS or whatever. The right on the other hand has been completely consumed by drag queen story hour, abortion, woke Disney and a dozen other stupid non-issues that don’t even rate in comparison to mass immigration. \n\nIt really is incredible. Nobody cared about Trump, the man. They shouldn’t have, anyways. There wasn’t, and isn’t, anything impressive anything about him. There was a little novelty value at the beginning but it wore off pretty quick. The only reason he got anywhere was he spoke to something no other politician had the courage to: the wide-spread but socially unacceptable fears of demographic replacement among white Americans. \n\n(Incidentally, everyone recognized this across the political spectrum, except for neocon DR3 types. Well, they recognized it, too, they just pretended otherwise).\n\nThis is what had everybody in a tizzy in 2016, right and left. This is what made left-wingers fear turbo-Hitler, and what made right-wingers think, “hey, maybe we can actually get somewhere with this guy.” \n\nUnfortunately, most people are hopeless morons so this somehow managed to turn into a Trump cult wherein millions of brain-dead right-wing Americans worship a fat old real estate mogul as if he were a god and their millions of brain-dead left-wing counterparts revile him like a demon, with an almost complete disregard on both sides for the actual original source of his popularity. \n\nI’m not sure what point I’m actually making here. Maybe that when “did that TEACHER with BLUE HAIR just say her pronouns are THEY/THEM?” is considered by ‘conservatives’ as big (or bigger!) an issue than millions of immigrants entering the country every year and demographic replacement continuing apace with no sign of abatement, it well and truly is Over. \n\n*Gott Strafe* LibsOfTikTok.",

    "body": "\n**The ease of orthodoxy**\n\nA few weeks ago I came across a Paul Graham essay I had missed when it first came out: http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html\n\nThe whole thing is good but I want to highlight this paragraph and footnote:\n\n&gt; To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the features of a religion. In particular it must have **strict and arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their purity by obeying**, and its adherents must believe that **anyone who obeys these rules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn't**. \n\n&gt; The superficial demands of orthodoxy make it an inexpensive substitute for virtue. And that in turn is **one of the reasons orthodoxy is so attractive to bad people. You could be a horrible person, and yet as long as you're orthodox, you're better than everyone who isn't**.\n\nThat explains a whole lot. There are people who are held inline just by fear of crossing the orthodoxy, but even normal people enjoy the thrill of moral superiority.\n\nAnd then there are the people who behave legitimately horribly but skate by by shouting orthofoxy. It is my default assumption for [mal](https://i.imgur.com/gcRoCAm.png)e [feminist](https://www.vulture.com/article/joss-whedon-allegations.html)s who are banking up brownie points because they know they are going to need them. They have karma and they intend to spend it.\n\nSo lo and behold when this week we get a perfect example, [Dan Price](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/technology/dan-price-resign-social-media.html). ([Archive link for NYT](https://archive.ph/TDCP5))\n\n**You can count on journalists to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other options**\n\nYou remember Dan Price. If not by the name, then as the guy who took a big pay cut from his $1.1 million salary to set a minimum wage of $70,000 for employees at his company, Gravity Payments. He did this because he found it unfair to get paid so much. He got a huge amount of publicity from all the usual sources, doing appearances on the *Daily Show* and similar puffery. Rush Limbaugh, on the other hand, called him a socialist, which if Price was scripting this would be exactly what he would have asked for.\n\nThen-at-Bloomberg reporter Karen Weise found out really quick [that there was a lot underneath the surface](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-gravity-ceo-dan-price/). ([Archive link for Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/v0wdA)). Price's brother sued him after the announcement because the brother was so mad about the wage increase, do you remember? Seattle Times and Inc magazine sure do.\n\nAs background, Price claimed his prior salary of $1.1 milion was set by market rates, but just compared to similar businesses and revenues, you would expect something closer to what was a third of his prior salary, so he was not giving up much. When Weise asked him about that in an interview, he changed the subject and ended the interview.\n\nWell, the reality is that his brother Lucas served him with a lawsuit claiming he was being overpaid. And *then* two weeks later Price docked his own pay. To what level? I have not been able to figure that out, but it could have been \"slashed\" from 3x market rate to 2x market rate.\n\nWhen confronted with this:\n\n&gt; In a follow-up interview in mid-November, I pressed Price about the inconsistency. How could what he told me about being served two weeks after announcing the raise be true when the court records indicated otherwise?\n\n&gt; “Umm, I’m not, I have to look,” he said.\n\n&gt; The court document, I said, definitely says March 16.\n\n&gt; “I am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise,” he replied.\n\n&gt; “The court record shows you being served on March 16 ... at 1:25 p.m.,” I said. “And actually, your answer to it was dated April 3,” also before the pay hike.\n\n&gt; “I am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise,” he repeated.\n\n&gt; I asked again how that could be, saying the declaration of service shows Price was served with the complaint, the summons, and other documents, “that you are a male, who is white, age 30, 5-feet-8-inches, medium height, dark hair.”\n\n&gt; He paused for 20 seconds. “Are you there?” he asked, then twice repeated his statement that he was only aware of the suit being initiated in late April. “I’d be happy to answer any other questions you may have,” he added.\n\nWhat else could conme out? His ex-wife who did a TedX talk at the University of Kentucky where she read from her journal entries from the time she was married. “He got mad at me for ignoring him and grabbed me and shook me again.” ... “He also threw me to the ground and got on top of me. He started punching me in the stomach and slapped me across the face. I was shaking so bad.”\n\n\n**\"What are you going to do, cancel me?\" - Man who was cancelled**\n\nWeise relayed these quotes to Price, who said he was not comfortable responding when he had no evidence of such an allegation. He called back three hours later to remember to say that the events never happend.\n\nWeise published her article and everyone who loved being in the room with him ran for the exits. Someone had called the emperor naked, and suddenly there were other things to do.\n\nTaking a page from Bill Clinton, Price told his staff that his ex-wife was nuts and needed to be restrained, but admitted he should not have done that. A year later his staff spontaneously gifted him with a new Tesla because they loved him so much, which was another media set up according to his head of marketing, another employee in marketing, and the young woman who had at the time claimed credit for coming up with the idea. Price gives this recitation of facts the Sharper Image  how-dare-you-say-our-product-is-fake-when-this-hurts-the-feelings-of-our-customers-who-did-not-know-that treatment: “the idea that some people are trying to soil this cherished memory is deeply hurtful.” He was quickly forgotten again.\n\n**Just tweet through it**\n\nBut Price was determined to get his spotlight back. He set out on a new quest to uncancel himself and hired an ex-Seattle Times reporter to shit out orthodoxy 24/7/365 on all social media channels.\n\nHe got back into the spotlight. Nick Kristof's NYT wrote [a lauditory opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/opinion/sunday/dan-price-minimum-wage.html) ([archive link for NYT](https://archive.ph/c5WU1)). Did it contain anything negative at all? Yes, it admitted there were \"bumps.\" Kristof links to the NYT's old story from when the narrative was that Lucas's lawsuit was in response to the pay policy. Kristof does not correct that narrative but knows better than to repeat it since it has been proven false by court records.\n\n&gt; There were bumps, no doubt about it. A couple of important employees quit, apparently feeling less valued when new hires were close to them in pay. The publicity forced Gravity, which processes credit card payments for small businesses, to hire additional people to handle a deluge of inquiries. Worst of all, Price’s brother, who owned a stake in the company, sued and alleged that Price hadn’t consulted him on decisions.\n\nNothing there is literally incorrect! Publish it! We are in the height of #MeToo but no need to publish accusations from his ex-wife TedX talk.\n\nOh, the ex-wife's TedX talk? Gravity's head of marketing called the University of Kentucky about \"potential defamation lawsuit\" and the university declined to publish it. This was known back in 2016 but no need to bring that up in a 2019 piece. Definitely nothing #MeToo relevant here, nosiree.\n\n**You can count on journalists to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other options and then forgotten the previous narrative and then once again exhausted all other options**\n\nSo Karen Weise writes a new article at NYT (the first link). And it turns out that he has been building up his SEO as the standard male feminist to lure in women. Doug Forbesm, a blogger, had been collecting accounts of women accusing Price for years. No one, including the NYT, wanted to run the story so he blogged them himself. Besides his ex-wife we have:\n\n* Serena Jowers filmed them having sex without her knowledge and three other women say he did the same to them.\n\n* Another described Price having sex without her consent in the middle of the night.\n\n* In a car ride, Shelby Hayne said he grabbed her throat and would not let go, and then drove donuts around a parking lot when he realized he was not getting any.\n\n* Danny Askini said he pushed her against a wall when he did not invite her upstairs after a date.\n\n* Kacie Margis did not know there were any warning signs because they did not come up in Google searches, and ended up in Palm Springs with him. She says she got locked out of their room while wearing a bikini, and later he had sex with her while she was asleep after taking an edible.\n\nThe Hayne incident ended up being investigated by the cops, which is what broke the dam and let everything else finally come out. \n\nHe resigned as CEO so he could devote his energy full time to fighting the false accusations against him. As Karen Weise is writing this article, you can tell she loves rubbing it in the face of media, including the NYT that she is currently writing the article for. And she fucking loves juxtaposing Price's orthodox social media posts with his actual behvavior. Particularly his posts about how easy it is for a man to disprove false allegations. (-͡°-͜ʖ-͡°)☞\n\nCurrent web searches are all about articles of his resignation so there may not be a third act for him.\n\nThe assault charge got dropped from the Hayne incident, but the cops had a gem they documented:\n\n&gt; According to the police report, Mr. Price boasted that no one had believed Ms. Colón’s allegations of abuse “because of who he is and that no one would believe her either.”\n\nAfter all, what use is all that cred as a male feminist if you cannot spend it?",

But, of course, this isn’t a novel idea.  In a dissent from the Seventh Circuit’s 2019 decision in Kanter v. Barr, then-Judge Amy Coney Barrett posited that the U.S. historical tradition of gun regulation—including laws disarming “\\[s\\]laves and Native Americans,” although obviously unconstitutional today—supports laws “based on present-day judgments about categories of people whose possession of guns would endanger the public safety” (such as, potentially, those who have posted online about a desire to commit violent acts).\n\nSo what is this referring to? In the response, the state leans on this argument:\n\n&gt;2. New York’s Good Moral Character Requirement Is Relevantly Similar To A Long Tradition Of Anglo-American History And Doctrine  \n&gt;  \n&gt;New York’s good moral character requirement is consistent with the long history in both England and America of disarming those whose *associations, reputation,* or conduct suggested they posed a danger to others or to the public order...\n\nItalics mine\n\n&gt;From the early days of English settlement in America, the colonies sought to prevent Native American tribes from acquiring firearms, passing laws forbidding the sale and trading of arms to Indigenous people....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;even after the English Bill of Rights established a right of the people to arm themselves, the right was only given to Protestants, based on a continued belief that Catholics were likely to engage in conduct that would harm themselves or others and upset the peace...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Virginia followed this example, passing an act in 1756 that ordered the disarmament of all Catholics or “reputed Papists” who refused to take an oath of loyalty to the colonial government. An Act for Disarming Papists, and Reputed Papisits \\[sic\\], Refusing to Take the Oaths to the Government (1756)\n\nWhile all of this may be good law practice, it's red meat for the war.

    "body": "Following up my “equality” post from the other day, I will talk about abortion and the way in which I strongly disagree with the framing on both sides of the issue. I think abortion is a similar issue because, like \"equality,\" people on \"both sides of the issue\" today share much more common ground than they think, and are thoroughly blinkered as a result. \n\nThe “anti-abortion” side is pretty straightforward, at least ostensibly. “Human life is sacred, fetus is human life, therefore no kill.” \n\nThe “pro-abortion” side cannot dispute the idea that human life qua human life, that is, individual members of the biological species *homo sapiens*, is sacred and inherently worthy protecting. So they must marshal different sorts of arguments, appealing to bodily autonomy or the inhumanity of the fetus. \n\nIntuitively, to me, it’s obvious that abortion is not equal to murder. It also seems to have been obvious to most people through most of history, since abortion has rarely ever been considered equal to murder, by law or custom. Even when it has been considered unsavory and even criminal, it was not considered equivalent to stabbing a man in the street or dashing out an infant’s brains. \n\nWhy is this? I think it is the same the reason that, in the classical world, infanticide was not considered equal to murder, either. Exposure was a common practice in the ancient world. Anti-abortion activists today are very fond of pointing out that the vast majority of abortion is not in cases of rape or incest, but simply in cases of a mother who does not feel she is “ready” or “capable” of taking care of a child. Likewise, in the ancient world, countless babies were exposed with the rationale, “just another mouth to feed,” or even, “don’t wanna take care of this thing,\" and thus left to die on rubbish heaps. \n\nAgain, this was a practice that was sometimes frowned upon, sometimes condemned, though never outlawed as far as I know, but never considered equal to actual murder. \n\nThis is because to be a full-fledged “human” it is not enough to be a biological member of the species *homo sapiens*. Humanity is contextual as much, or more so, as it is biological. To be a human means having a place in a social structure, obligations and rights. You have parents, children, brothers, sisters, friends, patrons, clients. You understand religion, history, civic duty. \n\nIf a member of the species *homo sapiens* was raised by wolves in the forest, and grew up without language, human parents, friends, religion, ethics, or socialization of any kind, he would be morally equal to a wild beast and could be killed with the same impunity as a wolf. A fetus, or an infant for that matter, is in the same position. This is what makes abortion unequal to murder, if it is a crime at all. \n\nModern anti-abortion activists cannot make this argument because they are, like their enemies, wedded to the idea that being homo sapiens makes one inherently sacred.",

Yet the interests of the wealthy have bought the ears of our elected officials. The cost seems very very minimal too, maybe just a couple million a year of campaign contributions to a handful of pivotal senators to save tens of billions in taxes over time.\n\nEven though the pundit class all knows about these, my suspicion is that the public doesn't care because these things seem like too arcane of details.\n\nThis to me is a fundamental unfairness within democracy. Yes technically we are a system of one person one vote, but as wealth can compound in an unlimited way AND wealth can be converted to equal political influence, we are destined to live in effectively an oligarchy.\n\nYes sometimes the oligarchies views can be swayed through naming and shaming and their offspring indoctrinated, but by and large we are much closer to 1$ 1 vote than 1 person 1 vote. Some among us may even view this as just in the sense that entrepreneurs who provide the most value to society should have a greater influence on society, but we're setting up a society where it's far more likely that someone who's rich is able to become an entrepreneur in the first place, ala Elon musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates. In addition to the genetic advantages of having smart parents, they also were afforded the connections and wealth to enable them to take risks.\n\nWith immigration of the best and brightest from around the world + randomness of genetics one generation to the next, there is still some chance of social mobility in the USA.\n\nBut I fear we are heading towards more and more of a static society of a late stage empire. Maybe with genetic engineering available and AGI light being owned by Google shareholders soon, we truly will revert to Neo feudalism, but gattaca style. Where everyone in society knows there station and doesn't bother rising above it.",

In general, it seems comparable to DALLE2, Imagen, and Parti, beating them in some ways and losing to them in others; the most general comment I'd offer is that it seems to do worse with semantic content and better with textures. This isn't too important: the next generation (which is to say, 6-12 months from now) will beat all of them in all their best aspects.\n\nAside from a lot of verbiage around using it ethically, the official and publicly hosted version includes a safety classifier that removes bad outputs. Yay? Of course, since it's open source, it's easy enough to modify the code, and the world got right to it. We already have the UnstableDiffusion and PornDiffusion subreddits, and there will be an proliferation of them and their content in the coming months without the need to dance around the OpenAI and Google ~~blacklists~~ blocklists. I mentioned this to a friend, and she said that at least we'll have a couples years before we could supply images of a person and have porn generated from them. I didn't have the heart to point her to [textual-inversion](https://textual-inversion.github.io/). Who'd have thought porn actresses would be some of the first to fall to AI? If it's any consolation to them, many other occupations are going to be wiped out in the coming first wave.\n\nIt seems like society is not just unprepared for this but unaware of how far along we are in the automated generation of digital content. For awhile it seemed like the hope was that professional gatekeepers would protect us, but it was obvious that strategy just needed a single defector to fail. If it wasn't Stability, it'd have been Yandex. If it wasn't Yandex, it would be a leak.\n\nRegardless, now the cat is out of the bag. I don't think there was or is any way to prevent or stop this, or even that it's bad that it's happening. What does seem likely is that we're in for a rough ride as society reacts to something that's blindsided it.",

    "body": "So reading some substacks has reminded me that there are basically four different kinds of writers on the culture war, or really any kind of commentary on conflict. \n\n1. Partisan propagandists. These are your Nathan J Robinsons. Their positions are predetermined, so their analyses are rarely anything but hackneyed. \"My side is good, the other side is bad,\" doesn't leave much room for nuance *or* actual insight. I used Robinson as an easy example, but there are plenty of weird Trumpists who somehow wanted to say that Russia were the good guys invading Ukraine. Although I'll totally admit that they're analyses weren't stale to start off with, they still quickly became predictable.\n\n2. Cynics/insult analysts. I am struggling to come up with any examples right now, but there are a lot of these in respected editorial positions. These people sometimes have interesting analysis, but so often they resort to content-free insults in order to show their disdain and that they are above the conflict. Never do they ever have actually constructive things to say. They just tear stuff down.These types of analysts had their hey day in the 90s, but plenty of them are still going by inertia in respected legacy media even today. This is actually the group that annoys me the most and got me to write up this analysis because I always forget they exist, and I will be fooled into reading some article because it isn't just partisan drivel, only to realize that it is the equivalent of socio-political malingering and their delight in being unorthodox is an end-goal in itself.\n\n3. (Un)orthodox ideologues. These are your Rod Drehers and Freddie DeBoers. Although they certainly have a side in the conflict, that side is just a means to an end, not a cause in itself. They have some greater vision that they are loyal to, and this allows them to see and critique \"their\" side in surprising and effective ways and see value in proposals from their \"opponents.\" These are the types of editorials that are really interesting to read.\n\n4. Exhaustively fair analysts. These are the Scott Alexanders. This is the rarest type, at least in conflict commentary. Most of the people who do this are probably being paid plenty of money for private analysis. Or, if not private, at least largely wonky topics that most people don't care about. Still, these are the gold standard when it comes to commentary. Not just because if their analysis, they aren't necessarily any more insightful than the 3s, but because their attempts to engage with all opinions charitably makes them powerful when it comes to persuasion. 1s are also very powerful when it comes to persuasion with their audience, but only on whatever topics won't make them considered traitors to their cause/audience. Scott has no such limits, and as a result he has convinced people to change positions on all sorts of issues. He has made people more trans-sympathetic and turned leftists into free-market supporters.  But it is also the hardest to do. People have complained that Scott doesn't really dig in and engage with a lot of topics like he used to. This style of writing takes the most intellectual and emotional energy. It's much harder than when you already know everyone on the other side is bad and wrong and your side is good and right. Or everyone is just corrupt and stupid, no matter the side. Especially since it is hard to remain an insightful, charitable person once you have had the eye of sauron upon you. Just look at Jordan Peterson.",

    "body": "**Nuclear weapons are a panacea that would bring us close to world peace were it not for the US**\n\nEvery so often, people bring up the fact that Taiwan's military spending is moribund, somewhere below 2% of GDP (China is at a similar level). The US is around 4%. They call for Taiwan to [get serious](https://international.thenewslens.com/article/123554) with its training and spend more on their own defence. It does not seem fair for the US to spend proportionately more for another countries security...\n\nHowever, there is only so much that Taiwan can do when outnumbered 20:1 in GDP. Taiwan is totally dependent upon foreign fuel and foreign food. The island produces around 10% of their food, China around 65%. There is only one way Taiwan could hope to deter the vastly larger Chinese military: nuclear weapons. The US [shut down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction) the Taiwanese nuclear program twice. Now, the US has forward-based nuclear weapons to Taiwan in the past but it is unlikely to do so today, given that China now has the power to hit the US mainland. \n\nIf Taiwan had nuclear weapons, there would be no potential crisis. China would not invade a country with a credible nuclear deterrent. The US enabled this looming disaster by suppressing Taiwan's nuclear ambitions and giving them vague, indefinite not-promises instead.\n\nSince Pakistan and India acquired nuclear weapons, they had only one small skirmish when in the past they would wage full-scale wars. Naturally, the US [sanctioned and harassed](https://www.eetimes.com/u-s-lifts-sanctions-against-india-pakistan/) them for taking this step towards peace. \n\nThere have been no full-scale great power conflicts since WW2, a 70-year historical anomaly. Nuclear weapons make it unprofitable to wage war, so states don't do it.\n\nIf my country, Australia, had nuclear weapons, we wouldn't need to fight in expensive, pointless US wars since we wouldn't need their nuclear umbrella or assistance. We would have genuine strategic independence, we could relax and enjoy mining rent.\n\nNow, one counterargument to my nuclear panacea argument is the tail-risk of nuclear war. If the US weren't so irresponsible, there would have been a much lower chance of nuclear war during the Cold War. It was the US's decision to invent the Cuban Missile Crisis, violently objecting to internal defense decisions made by the Soviets and Cubans. There are obvious similarities with the current Ukraine war and there is the mitigating factor that Cuba was in the US sphere while Ukraine is/was/contested in the Russian sphere. I don't particularly want to get bogged down in the movement of spheres of influence though. The way the US handled the crisis was extraordinarily aggressive. The US imposed a 'quarantine' of Cuba, an effective blockade. They flew [U-2 spy planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis#Crisis_continues) over Cuban airspace and had the temerity to complain when one was shot down! They dropped dummy depth charges on Soviet submarines to force them to surface, pointlessly causing the drama that legendary Arkhipov had to resolve. The US took various steps to raise tensions, dispersing its bombers around civilian airports and keeping some constantly in the air. They made it look as though they were preparing for nuclear war.\n\nThe 1983 nuclear scare is also the US's fault. Why were they launching [psychological operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83#Psychological_operations) and exercises right next to Kamchatka if not to spook the Soviets? Raising tensions in this way is deeply irresponsible, it erodes the commons of mutually assured destruction to eke out small-scale gains in analyzing Soviet military readiness, observing radar patterns etc... It's needlessly provocative to mock-punch somebody but pull your fist away at the last moment. SDI was similarly bad - if you don't want a nuclear war, don't invite a pre-emptive strike by creating a strategic defense system! Of course, the US is still doing it, they left the ABM treaty and have been building up a large missile defense apparatus via AEGIS and GMD.\n\nWhile North Korean leadership is regularly labelled as insane, they have not invaded anybody since the 1950s. Iran hasn't invaded anyone either, though they do wage proxy war (an activity not unknown by the US). On what basis can we argue that they would be irresponsible nuclear powers? Occasional political rhetoric calling for the destruction of Israel should not come before the logic of MAD, which has a far stronger empirical and historical basis. The Israelis have their fare share of [religious terrorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_religious_terrorism), yet they have remained responsible with their arsenal. \n\nObviously, it's advantageous for the US (and other nuclear powers to a lesser extent) to sanction and bully other states into refraining from nuclearizing. The more states that have nuclear weapons, the less powerful they become. If Iraq or Libya had nukes, the US couldn't have attacked them. The US of course has the strongest global power projection capacity and thus the most to lose from massive nuclearization. It isn't surprising that the US is the most eager to suppress nuclear weapons. \n\nBut I think this is important to consider when we discuss the looming risk of war, of geopolitical conflict generally. The assumption of nuclear risk in my view is excessively high and confuses nuclear risks with US risks. If Ukraine had nuclear weapons, there would be no problem today. What is far more destabilizing are airy promises of unspecified support for countries far away from their nuclear patron. Taiwan is only the most obvious example.\n\nIf the non-proliferation treaty didn't exist, the world would be a much better place and there would be fewer wars.",

Over the past decade, the political zeitgeist in India has been apparently captured indisputably by Hindu Nationalism in the national capacity, while still struggling in many states. Any strand of liberalism left isn't really a direction anymore, but pressure from above or outside. The term 'South Asia' is not very well liked in India, which is seen by many nationalists as a reductionism of their civilisation to another geographic patch of landmass and above all, a tacit affirmation of the current nation states of India and Pakistan as equally legitimate in inheriting the cultural ethnos of the subcontinent.\n\nBut in more recent years, the term has produced another bone to pick. White liberals are largely seen as the new cultural imperialists out to atomise societies and rearrange social relations between the sexes, ethnic groups, etc. They're also seen as militantly anti-India on matters such as Kashmir, with 'South Asian' think tanks being their academic arm to dissipate psyops against India. Finally, they're perceived to be tacitly pro-Pakistan. The last one is a litmus test for a lot of Indians as to whether its all about values or consumer demographics. Is Hindu Nationalism a genuine concern, or just another cudgel against Indians? If Indians are fair game to be criticised for their attitude towards Pakistanis, the reverse should be axiomatic, correct? Well, BBC and other media are seen as hypocritically smearing India over its domestic problems with communalism, caste, gender, etc., while violent crimes by Pakistani origin men in the UK are obscured, leave alone Pakistan's own social problems. Last year, NYT's [job listing](https://www.newslaundry.com/2021/07/08/did-nyts-job-posting-for-a-business-correspondent-in-india-deserve-the-outrage-it-got) for an India correspondent sparked a huge furore in Indian media. The part about India's South Asian neighbours especially raised eyebrows as to whether the implication was that India is the belligerent actor in the region, when every single one of the [Indo-Pak wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts) was initiated by Pakistan, one of which even involved a [huge genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide) by the Pakistani Army. This event is not discussed in the media, and Indian syllabi consider every even after Independence as contemporary history, so its not discussed in history textbooks either. But ever since war ignited in Ukraine almost 6 months ago, and India's repeated refusal to condemn the invasion and continued purchase of Russian oil, 1971 has been resuscitated yet again, as was Soviet support to India at the time. Suddenly, many Hindu Nationalists who were previously indifferent to Russia, turned [Russophilic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/29/india-russia-ukraine-media/). But I think this is largely out of hostility to liberals than anything else.\n\nFor now, it looks like Hindu Nationalism is not about to lose its political clout in India and this will continue to leave lots of annoyance with liberals. Even the BJP's political opponents have caved on key issues like the [Rohingya refugees](http://twocircles.net/2022aug22/446679.html) to pose any competition. In all, the Nehruvian era Congress elites simply did not connect to the subalterns in producing the cultural and economic prosperity that they had wanted, whether in their socialist shade during the Cold War or in their neoliberal shade since 2004. And the vacuum it left behind is no longer its own to fill.",
