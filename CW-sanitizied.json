They made Will unambiguously gay in season 4.  I hate it.  I hate everything about it.\n\nI remember when Stranger Things came out, a lot of us 80's kids loved it.  It felt relatively authentic to our childhoods, especially being a nerd back then.  A group of us loved it so much, we got together for a retro AD&amp;D 2E campaign.\n\nThe biking around everywhere.  The relatively undeveloped spread out suburban/rural town.  The total lack of adult supervision.  And of course, being a nerd super into something that utterly consumes your every waking thought.  And every moment spent at school is a moment you are patiently, or not so patiently, waiting to get back to that thing.\n\nProbably the most authentic part of it, to me, was Will being a late bloomer.  Because myself and most of my nerd friends, damned near through highschool for most of them, weren't that interested in girls.  Even afraid of them to be honest.  And this often resulted in us getting picked on, beat up, and of course called gay.  Back when that was an acceptable insult to throw around at a public grade school.\n\nMaybe one got a girlfriend.  But most had inclinations not dissimilar from the \"gay\" sentiments Will is constantly expressing, of just wanting to play D&amp;D and Nintendo their whole life.  I can barely describe how much this character choice rubs me the wrong way.  In effect, it validates every bully we ever had who thought the way we were made us gay.\n\nI donno, I hear there are some closeted gay 80's kids applauding it.  Good for them I guess?  Turns out culture truly is a zero sum game.",

    "body": "(Sort of) New from me: [Anger At Student Loan Cancellation Is Justified](https://tracingwoodgrains.substack.com/p/anger-at-student-loan-cancellation?sd=pf)\n\nThis essay will be largely familiar to all who read my thoughts on student loans in the culture war thread [two years ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/jv161w/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_november_16/gckh5ca/?context=999). Given the current salience of the issue, I thought I should revisit and expand the essay to account for the actual loan cancellation announcement. Partially excerpted below, with a focus on sections not included in my original post:\n\n&gt; In other words, it's not that one already suffered and got theirs, while the other is suffering. It's that one got their reward (no debt) and the other got theirs (meaningful university experience), and now the second wants to get the first's reward too. It's a pure ant and grasshopper story. City Journal calls this the “chump effect”, policy that punishes those who follow prosocial norms while rewarding those who defect, ultimately degrading social trust and eroding those norms. [...]\n\n&gt; In saying all this, I want to be clear: I have no quarrel with those who got a genuine raw deal from college, those who were deceived by predatory institutions or pressured into attending schools they did not belong at, those who suffered the costs of university while reaping none of the benefits. Nor do I object to people who took out loans, secured upward mobility, and work to pay those loans back taking the write-off that has been offered. The core of my ire is reserved for the Nathan J Robinsons and Briahna Joy Grays of the world, the champagne socialists who agreed to student loans to build influence and prestige before using that influence to change the agreement retroactively—and for the politicians who yielded to pressure and altered the deal for political expediency. People are not grasshoppers for taking loans out or accepting write-offs when offered, but for accepting a cost to gain an edge over others, then turning around to demand those others pay that cost. [...]\n\n&gt; I vocally supported Biden in 2020 and have no regrets about that choice. Between almost any Democrat and Trump, I will pick the Democrat without hesitation, even with risks like this in mind. But my alliance with the left has always been an uneasy one, with no shortage of serious disputes. I am a politically unaffiliated centrist who recognizes that the value of my vote, inasmuch as it exists, lies in its willingness to flip. I have a small platform and a strong personal stake in this issue—while it’s certainly not the biggest issue in politics, it’s one that has a dramatically outsized role in my own life and where my own advocacy energy seems well-placed. I believe the Democrats should lose votes and political capital as a direct result of this cynically timed vote-buying to a larger extent than my own voice can influence, providing an impetus for them to change direction sharply before 2024.\n\n&gt; Given all of this, I will not vote blue in 2022. I cannot support a party that does not even pretend to understand my concerns, one that helps its activists gleefully wrest a bribe from the commons as they cynically claim to speak for the poor, one that arbitrarily frees a relatively advantaged group from their freely entered obligations at the expense of those who avoided those debts—then acts as if all who object are hypocrites worthy of no attention or respect. If this is the direction “progressive” politics is going, I want no part of it.",

    "body": "So the USA is supposed to be this semi-libertarian, cutthroat, winner-take-all and fuck the rest place, if you ever hear a non-American speak of the country. But it sure isn't! Somehow every big blue city managed to vote its way into high taxes and low law enforcement, individual states (RI, I forget about any others) tried to turn travel into \"papers, please\", and the president forced every gov't employee to either take a shot (not discussing efficacy, just the coercion) or quit their jobs. \n\nSo I'm very curious - why do Americans suddenly care about their neighbors? How did the country go from \"fuck you, I'm gonna do what I want\" to \"Heaven forbid I misgender you\"? What happened to the people that conquered every frontier they could find? I'm not asking rhetorically, I'm genuinely puzzled as to how the culture has completely changed, because it can't be as simple as a top-down change - after all, the USSR fell apart, and the state controlled the entirety of the educational pipeline. \n\nHere's the real question, finally: what made the general person in America suddenly in favor of redistribution? What got everyone to stop feeling like a temporarily embarrassed millionaire? And why did it work in the USA? It can't be as simple as a top-down edict, because if that actually worked, the USSR would still be around. And yet, country that was the antithesis of communism seems to be leaning in to the nanny state thing pretty hard. Is it just because the USSR fell apart and there's no longer any counterexample to warn away from? What happened to the nine scariest words in the English language? \n\nI just can't put together a model for the type of American that defines the Overton window. How on earth did the people of the most prosperous, most capitalist country change their minds?\n\nMy current working theory is that the Purutanisn that runs through the very core of the USA was suppressed for a generation or two (60s-10s or so) and is now reasserting itself. What is happening now is very much in line with Salem. Maybe everyone was just lucky to catch the industrial revolution and then the technological revolution and reap the benefits of the increased productivity to keep themselves occupied with their own prosperity, but now that technological progress has stalled (in the sense that there is nothing new being made, just incremental improvements) everything is back to how it was - segregation (look at all the skin color-specific affinity groups, both at work and at school), policing male/female interactions, etc.",

Some acted effeminate, some had a strange sense of humor, some were quirky, some walked funny or had certain affectations in their voice. Basically in all the standard gay stereotypes that we have as a society (or maybe in general? Do those stereotypes hold cross-culturally?). I maintained, as I was taught at the time, that just because someone acts that way, it has no bearing on their sexual orientation. They could be effeminate, but still like women. And as we grew up, guess what? Those boys all came out of the closet as gay, some in high school, some afterward.\n\nI could see 3 possibilities:\n\n1. The stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason. They acted that way because having those behaviors were highly correlated with being gay. Basically, liking men goes hand in hand with gay behavior, for most cases\n2. Because everyone in their lives \"knew\" they were gay due to the way that they acted, they absorbed it into their own sense of self, and thus, essentially became gay. Basically, gay behavior leads to liking men.\n3. Because they were gay, they saw the signals that you're supposed to produce in the culture, and subsequently acted them out. Basically, liking men leads to gay behavior\n\nI'm not sure which makes the most sense as an explanation.\n\nI'm still disturbed that I was the \"good\" kid, who did as I was told, and did not judge anyone or make assumptions about anyone based on their signals, just as I was taught to, and ended up being 100% wrong because of it. I also wonder if the popular perception in culture has changed, these days. With so much emphasis on identity, are people still taught that anyone could be anything, and that their behavior is uncorrelated to their sexual identity? Or does being gay go beyond just liking men, and it's more about performance than ever?",

We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically there's about to be some kind of dump that's similar to that. So just be vigilant.\"\n\nBy my interpretation, Zuckerberg is implying that his team acted based on the request from the FBI. Perhaps the FBI will have plausible deniability to assert that this was a \"general request\" rather than a specific demand to spike this story. Twitter censorship was even more aggressive than Facebook's, so it would be interesting to know if Twitter received similar requests from the FBI and if any of this communication referred to this story in particular.\n\nIs Zuckerberg mistakenly generating controversy by apparently blaming the FBI for Facebook's decision to censor the story in the runup to the election? Or is he just being honest in confessing the truth on Rogan's show? Zuckerberg has always shown more personal hesitancy to engage in censorship, although in the past he has [ultimately folded in the face of enormous pressure](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54509975). I think he knows this will create more controversy for the FBI and he's signaling that he does not want similar requests in future election cycles.\n\nBut as we've discussed recently, Facebook's content policy is now run by [ex-CIA](https://mronline.org/2022/07/14/meet-the-ex-cia-agents-deciding-facebooks-content-policy/) so similar requests for the cooperation of Facebook's moderation team may not even become known to Zuckerberg himself.",

Nothing conclusive, and the police announce that [they don't suspect foul play](https://news.yahoo.com/finnish-police-not-action-against-095348944.html/) related to videos. [Marin took a drug test](https://yle.fi/news/3-12588465), but since it's an urine test and not a hair test, critics claim it proves nothing.\n\n\\- Some major other local discussions: why wasn't Marin [formally on holiday when partying](https://yle.fi/news/3-12583726)? what if the Russians had attacked while she was drunk, or if there had been a crisis equivalent to the [MS Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_MS_Estonia) ship disaster? (Note: Russia has actually sent most of the troops in the Northwestern area to Ukraine, and Finnish crisis laws are written in a way that would nevertheless enable reacting to crises even if she had actually been in complete blackout mode.) Are the celebrities that Marin partied with high-status enough? (They're basically Instagram influencers and pop stars, and 5-10 years younger than 36-year-old Marin)? Is it all just media effort to get clicks and try to demonstrate they're not going easy on Marin for being young and female and leftist?\n\n\\- Marin was also accused of cheating on her husband (and the father of her child) when a [video turned out](https://www.is.fi/politiikka/art-2000009015380.html) where she's dancing with a guy (actually locally quite famous actor/singer Olavi Uusivirta) who is totally trying to get his mack on. I wouldn't say the video shows her cheating, unless she and her husband have agreed the other party can't even dance with the opposite sex. At least as far as I've interpreted it, she's not really responding to her attempts and (I would guess) gently tells him to stop trying at some point. When asked about this video, Marin said that she thought Uusivirta \"was trying to whisper her something\", which is quite silly, but a friend of mine, when we talked about the scandal, said that she probably phrased it that way since if she had said \"Olavi Uusivirta was trying to lick my neck even though I said no\" it would probably have been a career-ender for him, rather than her.\n\n\\- It turns out that two of Marin's celeb friends took a picture of themselves kissing while topless at Marin's official residence in Kesäranta, ie. Finland's Downing Street 11. This was widely considered to be inappropiate due to the official status of the location, as well as due to the idea that there might have been state secrets in the apartment. (One columnist even compared it to January 6, lol. If you want evidence about the mental American colonization of European politics...) [Marin promptly apologized](https://yle.fi/news/3-12589779).\n\n\\- There's a ton of news about this in foreign media, which is a huge thing in Finland in itself, since Finland is a country of 5,5 million people and, as such countries often tend to do, is hugely interested in all the cases where it is mentioned outside of its own borders, as [this meme, for instance](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/400x/12412665.jpg), indicates. (I've heard that New Zealanders, for instance, behave the same way). Foreign coverage, like [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/24/finlands-pm-is-a-young-woman-in-power-her-partying-is-the-total-opposite-of-disgrace?CMP=share_btn_fb), seems to range from \"look at this hot PM\" to \"is this a plot by Putin\" to \"haha, it turns out that Finns are stuffy and conservative for hating their PM for dancing\". As I've noted, the actual criticisms aren't really as much about dancing as about the possibility of drug use in her vicinity and about the crises.\n\n\\- [Marin gives a tearful address](https://yle.fi/news/3-12591456) in Social Democratic party meeting, saying \"I am a human being. In the midst of the crisis, I have been thinking about Ukraine and about all of you\" (the [rest of her speech was about Ukraine](https://yle.fi/news/3-12589250) and shows the hardening of opinions in Finland about Russia, it wasn't just a random statement).\n\nI'm guessing that if there's not something new and conclusive turning up, the scandal is going to start dying, but of course something new and conclusive might very well turn up. Finnish social medias have been abuzz with constant suggestions there's new videos moving on around, including one journalist claiming that a video in the \"Thor network\" showing drug use, but this turning out to be a prank.\n\n(edit: edited in a paragraph about the dancing video with Uusivirta)",

But it's been 6 months and support seems as strong as ever, at least judging by the recent 3bn military transfer along with the number of blue-and-yellow emojis on twitter. For many reasons, I think this war is not only a great chance to beat back Russian expansionism, but also to bring Ukraine closer to the west, hence why this question is important for me.\n\nSo--why do Americans seem so eager to help Ukraine?\n\nMy take is that it's mainly because they're acting out values that we admire.\n\nZelensky, for one, didn't run away and has remained deeply engaged throughout the conflict. As have many Ukrainians, both men and women, who chose to either stay behind or go back after the initial exodus. But it's not just personal courage that's delivered to us via news reports that we admire--it's also the example of national unity.\n\nIt struck me how low of an opinion Americans have to Afghans and Iraqis. The boots on the ground critique has focused on how cowardly or lazy their soldiers are, but I think the bigger reason for American disdain for them is their complete lack of national allegiance.  Perhaps I'm talking out of my ass, but these two societies don't exactly fit the definition of society because they're more like a loose collection of tribes. In that sense, what they did made absolute sense: why risk your life for a different tribe? But from an American, even a Western perspective, this looks like a complete lack of skin in the game, especially in view of the recent news pouring out of the country of what their women are now subject to what with the taliban in power. The unspoken question is: why didn't they fight to protect their society and their way of life? (Taking into account a handful of individuals who did the needful).\n\nI think Americans will continue to support Ukraine for the near future, at least another year or two because the Ukrainians are behaving in ways that Americans, irrespective of political leanings, can admire.",

Or perhaps that black people received longer sentences under the current government \n in the event that violent offenders tend to get longer sentences.  No one lobbying for the progressive, or perhaps even black, vote wants to be the focus of a headline saying that arrests of black people increased under their leadership. Conversations surrounding equity are simply not nuanced enough for the politician to be able to counter that there's more to it than those statistics, that it's just because they focused more on violent crime so people who commit violent crime were arrested at higher rates.

    "body": "It blows my mind how thoroughly Trump’s 2016 campaign has been forgotten. What I mean is that Trump effectively ran on a single issue in 2016: immigration. He was going to “build the wall and deport them all.” That’s why he was elected, not because of “wokeness,” or “liberal elites,” or to end foreign wars or whatever. \n\nAnd yet that’s been almost entirely forgotten in the years since. Trump’s presidency was a resounding failure on the anti-immigration front, so maybe that’s why. \n\nBut for whatever reason, today immigration has fallen almost completely by the wayside compared to 2016. On both sides. The daily “Trump bad” pieces in the media are rarely about immigrants anymore, they’re about Trump’s “erosion of democratic norms” or SCOTUS or whatever. The right on the other hand has been completely consumed by drag queen story hour, abortion, woke Disney and a dozen other stupid non-issues that don’t even rate in comparison to mass immigration. \n\nIt really is incredible. Nobody cared about Trump, the man. They shouldn’t have, anyways. There wasn’t, and isn’t, anything impressive anything about him. There was a little novelty value at the beginning but it wore off pretty quick. The only reason he got anywhere was he spoke to something no other politician had the courage to: the wide-spread but socially unacceptable fears of demographic replacement among white Americans. \n\n(Incidentally, everyone recognized this across the political spectrum, except for neocon DR3 types. Well, they recognized it, too, they just pretended otherwise).\n\nThis is what had everybody in a tizzy in 2016, right and left. This is what made left-wingers fear turbo-Hitler, and what made right-wingers think, “hey, maybe we can actually get somewhere with this guy.” \n\nUnfortunately, most people are hopeless morons so this somehow managed to turn into a Trump cult wherein millions of brain-dead right-wing Americans worship a fat old real estate mogul as if he were a god and their millions of brain-dead left-wing counterparts revile him like a demon, with an almost complete disregard on both sides for the actual original source of his popularity. \n\nI’m not sure what point I’m actually making here. Maybe that when “did that TEACHER with BLUE HAIR just say her pronouns are THEY/THEM?” is considered by ‘conservatives’ as big (or bigger!) an issue than millions of immigrants entering the country every year and demographic replacement continuing apace with no sign of abatement, it well and truly is Over. \n\n*Gott Strafe* LibsOfTikTok.",

    "body": "\n**The ease of orthodoxy**\n\nA few weeks ago I came across a Paul Graham essay I had missed when it first came out: http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html\n\nThe whole thing is good but I want to highlight this paragraph and footnote:\n\n&gt; To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the features of a religion. In particular it must have **strict and arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their purity by obeying**, and its adherents must believe that **anyone who obeys these rules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn't**. \n\n&gt; The superficial demands of orthodoxy make it an inexpensive substitute for virtue. And that in turn is **one of the reasons orthodoxy is so attractive to bad people. You could be a horrible person, and yet as long as you're orthodox, you're better than everyone who isn't**.\n\nThat explains a whole lot. There are people who are held inline just by fear of crossing the orthodoxy, but even normal people enjoy the thrill of moral superiority.\n\nAnd then there are the people who behave legitimately horribly but skate by by shouting orthofoxy. It is my default assumption for [mal](https://i.imgur.com/gcRoCAm.png)e [feminist](https://www.vulture.com/article/joss-whedon-allegations.html)s who are banking up brownie points because they know they are going to need them. They have karma and they intend to spend it.\n\nSo lo and behold when this week we get a perfect example, [Dan Price](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/technology/dan-price-resign-social-media.html). ([Archive link for NYT](https://archive.ph/TDCP5))\n\n**You can count on journalists to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other options**\n\nYou remember Dan Price. If not by the name, then as the guy who took a big pay cut from his $1.1 million salary to set a minimum wage of $70,000 for employees at his company, Gravity Payments. He did this because he found it unfair to get paid so much. He got a huge amount of publicity from all the usual sources, doing appearances on the *Daily Show* and similar puffery. Rush Limbaugh, on the other hand, called him a socialist, which if Price was scripting this would be exactly what he would have asked for.\n\nThen-at-Bloomberg reporter Karen Weise found out really quick [that there was a lot underneath the surface](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-gravity-ceo-dan-price/). ([Archive link for Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/v0wdA)). Price's brother sued him after the announcement because the brother was so mad about the wage increase, do you remember? Seattle Times and Inc magazine sure do.\n\nAs background, Price claimed his prior salary of $1.1 milion was set by market rates, but just compared to similar businesses and revenues, you would expect something closer to what was a third of his prior salary, so he was not giving up much. When Weise asked him about that in an interview, he changed the subject and ended the interview.\n\nWell, the reality is that his brother Lucas served him with a lawsuit claiming he was being overpaid. And *then* two weeks later Price docked his own pay. To what level? I have not been able to figure that out, but it could have been \"slashed\" from 3x market rate to 2x market rate.\n\nWhen confronted with this:\n\n&gt; In a follow-up interview in mid-November, I pressed Price about the inconsistency. How could what he told me about being served two weeks after announcing the raise be true when the court records indicated otherwise?\n\n&gt; “Umm, I’m not, I have to look,” he said.\n\n&gt; The court document, I said, definitely says March 16.\n\n&gt; “I am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise,” he replied.\n\n&gt; “The court record shows you being served on March 16 ... at 1:25 p.m.,” I said. “And actually, your answer to it was dated April 3,” also before the pay hike.\n\n&gt; “I am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise,” he repeated.\n\n&gt; I asked again how that could be, saying the declaration of service shows Price was served with the complaint, the summons, and other documents, “that you are a male, who is white, age 30, 5-feet-8-inches, medium height, dark hair.”\n\n&gt; He paused for 20 seconds. “Are you there?” he asked, then twice repeated his statement that he was only aware of the suit being initiated in late April. “I’d be happy to answer any other questions you may have,” he added.\n\nWhat else could conme out? His ex-wife who did a TedX talk at the University of Kentucky where she read from her journal entries from the time she was married. “He got mad at me for ignoring him and grabbed me and shook me again.” ... “He also threw me to the ground and got on top of me. He started punching me in the stomach and slapped me across the face. I was shaking so bad.”\n\n\n**\"What are you going to do, cancel me?\" - Man who was cancelled**\n\nWeise relayed these quotes to Price, who said he was not comfortable responding when he had no evidence of such an allegation. He called back three hours later to remember to say that the events never happend.\n\nWeise published her article and everyone who loved being in the room with him ran for the exits. Someone had called the emperor naked, and suddenly there were other things to do.\n\nTaking a page from Bill Clinton, Price told his staff that his ex-wife was nuts and needed to be restrained, but admitted he should not have done that. A year later his staff spontaneously gifted him with a new Tesla because they loved him so much, which was another media set up according to his head of marketing, another employee in marketing, and the young woman who had at the time claimed credit for coming up with the idea. Price gives this recitation of facts the Sharper Image  how-dare-you-say-our-product-is-fake-when-this-hurts-the-feelings-of-our-customers-who-did-not-know-that treatment: “the idea that some people are trying to soil this cherished memory is deeply hurtful.” He was quickly forgotten again.\n\n**Just tweet through it**\n\nBut Price was determined to get his spotlight back. He set out on a new quest to uncancel himself and hired an ex-Seattle Times reporter to shit out orthodoxy 24/7/365 on all social media channels.\n\nHe got back into the spotlight. Nick Kristof's NYT wrote [a lauditory opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/opinion/sunday/dan-price-minimum-wage.html) ([archive link for NYT](https://archive.ph/c5WU1)). Did it contain anything negative at all? Yes, it admitted there were \"bumps.\" Kristof links to the NYT's old story from when the narrative was that Lucas's lawsuit was in response to the pay policy. Kristof does not correct that narrative but knows better than to repeat it since it has been proven false by court records.\n\n&gt; There were bumps, no doubt about it. A couple of important employees quit, apparently feeling less valued when new hires were close to them in pay. The publicity forced Gravity, which processes credit card payments for small businesses, to hire additional people to handle a deluge of inquiries. Worst of all, Price’s brother, who owned a stake in the company, sued and alleged that Price hadn’t consulted him on decisions.\n\nNothing there is literally incorrect! Publish it! We are in the height of #MeToo but no need to publish accusations from his ex-wife TedX talk.\n\nOh, the ex-wife's TedX talk? Gravity's head of marketing called the University of Kentucky about \"potential defamation lawsuit\" and the university declined to publish it. This was known back in 2016 but no need to bring that up in a 2019 piece. Definitely nothing #MeToo relevant here, nosiree.\n\n**You can count on journalists to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other options and then forgotten the previous narrative and then once again exhausted all other options**\n\nSo Karen Weise writes a new article at NYT (the first link). And it turns out that he has been building up his SEO as the standard male feminist to lure in women. Doug Forbesm, a blogger, had been collecting accounts of women accusing Price for years. No one, including the NYT, wanted to run the story so he blogged them himself. Besides his ex-wife we have:\n\n* Serena Jowers filmed them having sex without her knowledge and three other women say he did the same to them.\n\n* Another described Price having sex without her consent in the middle of the night.\n\n* In a car ride, Shelby Hayne said he grabbed her throat and would not let go, and then drove donuts around a parking lot when he realized he was not getting any.\n\n* Danny Askini said he pushed her against a wall when he did not invite her upstairs after a date.\n\n* Kacie Margis did not know there were any warning signs because they did not come up in Google searches, and ended up in Palm Springs with him. She says she got locked out of their room while wearing a bikini, and later he had sex with her while she was asleep after taking an edible.\n\nThe Hayne incident ended up being investigated by the cops, which is what broke the dam and let everything else finally come out. \n\nHe resigned as CEO so he could devote his energy full time to fighting the false accusations against him. As Karen Weise is writing this article, you can tell she loves rubbing it in the face of media, including the NYT that she is currently writing the article for. And she fucking loves juxtaposing Price's orthodox social media posts with his actual behvavior. Particularly his posts about how easy it is for a man to disprove false allegations. (-͡°-͜ʖ-͡°)☞\n\nCurrent web searches are all about articles of his resignation so there may not be a third act for him.\n\nThe assault charge got dropped from the Hayne incident, but the cops had a gem they documented:\n\n&gt; According to the police report, Mr. Price boasted that no one had believed Ms. Colón’s allegations of abuse “because of who he is and that no one would believe her either.”\n\nAfter all, what use is all that cred as a male feminist if you cannot spend it?",

But, of course, this isn’t a novel idea.  In a dissent from the Seventh Circuit’s 2019 decision in Kanter v. Barr, then-Judge Amy Coney Barrett posited that the U.S. historical tradition of gun regulation—including laws disarming “\\[s\\]laves and Native Americans,” although obviously unconstitutional today—supports laws “based on present-day judgments about categories of people whose possession of guns would endanger the public safety” (such as, potentially, those who have posted online about a desire to commit violent acts).\n\nSo what is this referring to? In the response, the state leans on this argument:\n\n&gt;2. New York’s Good Moral Character Requirement Is Relevantly Similar To A Long Tradition Of Anglo-American History And Doctrine  \n&gt;  \n&gt;New York’s good moral character requirement is consistent with the long history in both England and America of disarming those whose *associations, reputation,* or conduct suggested they posed a danger to others or to the public order...\n\nItalics mine\n\n&gt;From the early days of English settlement in America, the colonies sought to prevent Native American tribes from acquiring firearms, passing laws forbidding the sale and trading of arms to Indigenous people....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;even after the English Bill of Rights established a right of the people to arm themselves, the right was only given to Protestants, based on a continued belief that Catholics were likely to engage in conduct that would harm themselves or others and upset the peace...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Virginia followed this example, passing an act in 1756 that ordered the disarmament of all Catholics or “reputed Papists” who refused to take an oath of loyalty to the colonial government. An Act for Disarming Papists, and Reputed Papisits \\[sic\\], Refusing to Take the Oaths to the Government (1756)\n\nWhile all of this may be good law practice, it's red meat for the war.

Perhaps during the month or two following the election there was the (quite implausible) possibility that someone could genuinely believe the election actually was stolen, and we really could convince them with evidence.

    "body": "Following up my “equality” post from the other day, I will talk about abortion and the way in which I strongly disagree with the framing on both sides of the issue. I think abortion is a similar issue because, like \"equality,\" people on \"both sides of the issue\" today share much more common ground than they think, and are thoroughly blinkered as a result. \n\nThe “anti-abortion” side is pretty straightforward, at least ostensibly. “Human life is sacred, fetus is human life, therefore no kill.” \n\nThe “pro-abortion” side cannot dispute the idea that human life qua human life, that is, individual members of the biological species *homo sapiens*, is sacred and inherently worthy protecting. So they must marshal different sorts of arguments, appealing to bodily autonomy or the inhumanity of the fetus. \n\nIntuitively, to me, it’s obvious that abortion is not equal to murder. It also seems to have been obvious to most people through most of history, since abortion has rarely ever been considered equal to murder, by law or custom. Even when it has been considered unsavory and even criminal, it was not considered equivalent to stabbing a man in the street or dashing out an infant’s brains. \n\nWhy is this? I think it is the same the reason that, in the classical world, infanticide was not considered equal to murder, either. Exposure was a common practice in the ancient world. Anti-abortion activists today are very fond of pointing out that the vast majority of abortion is not in cases of rape or incest, but simply in cases of a mother who does not feel she is “ready” or “capable” of taking care of a child. Likewise, in the ancient world, countless babies were exposed with the rationale, “just another mouth to feed,” or even, “don’t wanna take care of this thing,\" and thus left to die on rubbish heaps. \n\nAgain, this was a practice that was sometimes frowned upon, sometimes condemned, though never outlawed as far as I know, but never considered equal to actual murder. \n\nThis is because to be a full-fledged “human” it is not enough to be a biological member of the species *homo sapiens*. Humanity is contextual as much, or more so, as it is biological. To be a human means having a place in a social structure, obligations and rights. You have parents, children, brothers, sisters, friends, patrons, clients. You understand religion, history, civic duty. \n\nIf a member of the species *homo sapiens* was raised by wolves in the forest, and grew up without language, human parents, friends, religion, ethics, or socialization of any kind, he would be morally equal to a wild beast and could be killed with the same impunity as a wolf. A fetus, or an infant for that matter, is in the same position. This is what makes abortion unequal to murder, if it is a crime at all. \n\nModern anti-abortion activists cannot make this argument because they are, like their enemies, wedded to the idea that being homo sapiens makes one inherently sacred.",

Yet the interests of the wealthy have bought the ears of our elected officials. The cost seems very very minimal too, maybe just a couple million a year of campaign contributions to a handful of pivotal senators to save tens of billions in taxes over time.\n\nEven though the pundit class all knows about these, my suspicion is that the public doesn't care because these things seem like too arcane of details.\n\nThis to me is a fundamental unfairness within democracy. Yes technically we are a system of one person one vote, but as wealth can compound in an unlimited way AND wealth can be converted to equal political influence, we are destined to live in effectively an oligarchy.\n\nYes sometimes the oligarchies views can be swayed through naming and shaming and their offspring indoctrinated, but by and large we are much closer to 1$ 1 vote than 1 person 1 vote. Some among us may even view this as just in the sense that entrepreneurs who provide the most value to society should have a greater influence on society, but we're setting up a society where it's far more likely that someone who's rich is able to become an entrepreneur in the first place, ala Elon musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates.
