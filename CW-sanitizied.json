I personally don't have a problem with the idea of people being transgender. My biggest problem with it is I think we don't have the technology to actually do what is being promised and the surgery/transitioning is cruel to vulnerable people. All you have to do is go on /b or /pol to see the results to see that this is not a settled scientific process. I know it sounds gross, but seeing the results of these surgeries just makes me sick to my stomach. And then you have the child side where kids who aren't even fully developed emotionally/physically getting life changing surgery that can't be reversed. This is what bothers me the most.\n\nI truly think we will look back on this time the same as we do with lobotomies. It feels like we are doing experimental surgery on vulnerable people who would be better off staying their assigned gender. That's my argument against this current (what I consider) madness.\n\nI feel that most people agree with me here. However, if transitioning was actually possible, would you change your mind? To me, it makes the debate over. If you can safely and effectively transition people, what is the downside?\n\nEdit: On the 4chan part, I was being glib there. The point I was trying to make is that we only see bad results. With how aggressive the trans lobby is, if they were actually the same in how they looked, people would be saying look it's indistinguishable. That fact that we don't see this shows they know it looks unnatural and would be off-putting to most people if they actually saw the results. I’ve never seen a trans person pass irl. If they can’t make a person pass, there’s no way they can make a passing sex organ. The only people I've seen pass (and only online) are people who didn't go through puberty as the opposite sex. But that would basically mean we'd have to transition children, which I am pretty skeptical of.",

    "body": "**Biological Sex without Teleology**\n\nAre a bird's wings \"for\" flying?\n\nFrom a metaphysical naturalist understanding of modern biology, the answer has to be no. \"For\" implies a purpose, and purpose belongs to agents.\n\nAn airplane's wings are for flying - the intentions of engineers ensure that. But birds had no creator, no agent involved in their existence. We might be able to metaphorically talk about a bird being \"designed\" or \"built\" for flight, but it is only that: a metaphor.\n\nIf we want to limit our description to what can be described based on an physico-empirical view of reality, then a bird's wing's **make flight possible** or **allow them to fly**, but we can't speak about a bird's wings being \"for\" anything at all.\n\nSo too with the word \"need.\"\n\nDoes a seed \"need\" water and sunlight and nutrient rich soil? A metaphysical naturalist would say no. \"Need\" implies that there's some sort of goal, or right way for a seed to be, but the universe doesn't care if a seed dies or grows into a giant tree over many eons.\n\nHumans trying to grow seeds might \"need\" water, and fertilizer and a location with the right amount of sun in order to fulfill that goal, but regarding the seed itself we can only make predictions about the outcomes of different conditions on the seed.\n\nIf the seed experiences Scenario A (X units of water delivered at intervals Y, Z units of soil of composition W, V hours of average daily sun exposure, etc.) then it will grow into a big tree, but if the seed experiences Scenario B (no water, no sun, no soil) it will stay a seed and die, with a thousand possible predictions branching off from these two.\n\nSo what do we make of \"sex\" from this standpoint?\n\nI think the radical thing that this line of thinking implies is to stop thinking about \"man\" and \"woman\" as some sort of natural pairing.\n\nJust as there are seeds, and we can make predictions about what effects particular conditions will have on the seed, so too there are animals and we can make predictions about what effects particular conditions will have on those animals.\n\nIf the gamete of animal A finds its way to the gamete of animal B, we might get a zygote, or we might get nothing at all depending on the particular animals involved and the particular gametes.\n\nThings start to come down to categoricity and disciplined pattern formation.\n\nIs a penis \"for\" a vagina? Is an ovum \"for\" a sperm? Do men and women have some sort of complimentary relationship?\n\nIt is almost certain that humans come pre-installed with social hardware that predisposes them to think of human males and human females as belonging to one type or category in some sense - the human. But if we pull back the curtains, we can see an equally valid way of slicing up reality: men and women are different but \"related\" things.\n\nMen and women rely on each other to reproduce their own kind. Men can't make more of themselves without women, and women can't make more of themselves without men. But why think of them as part of one \"species\" or \"type\"? Sure, they share a lot of similarities, and can be contrasted against things like \"rabbits\" as a whole, even as one can draw parallels between \"human males\" and \"rabbit males.\"\n\nI believe it was Bret Weinstein who said that if alien biologists came down to Earth, they would rediscover the concept of sex every day. I don't exactly take issue with this claim, but I do wonder if the aliens would have the encyclopedia entry \"Humans\", or if there would be two encyclopedia entries \"[Human-Male]\" and \"[Human-Female].\"\n\nThere's one layer deeper to go here, though. Would the alien biologists even stop there? How would they deal with intersex individuals?\n\nI think a certain form of so-called \"binary\" thinking is to talk about there being men and women, with intersex individuals being deviations from the norm that can still be forced into one of those two boxes, or filed away into a \"freak of nature\" box (though we would never call it that with modern social mores.)\n\nBut I think this \"binary\" thinking has exactly the same problem that \"needs\"- or \"for\"-based thinking produces: it engages in teleological thinking.\n\nWe could imagine that instead of having abstractions at the level of \"man\" and woman\" that the alien biologists have a unique compound word for everything that basically contains every bit of information about that thing known to the aliens.\n\nAt this level, maybe the alien biologists could notice patterns between two things, which for us would become categories, but for them remain unabstracted, ungeneralized observations about the entirety of existing things. Maybe these aliens don't even have the concept of \"distinct things\" but instead build up observations from correlations of raw sensory data that doesn't get processed by modules in their brain into \"objects\" and \"animals\" and \"things\", but instead is dealt with as a Unity with sub-patterns within patterns that can be interacted with and about which predictions can be made.\n\nI think our brain modules do a lot of work in making certain \"categories\" seem more plausible than others, that is the source of the shadow of teleology projected back out into the world. However, once we see past the shadow, it might genuinely become impossible to pick a point to stop cutting reality at the joints.",

    "body": "So, fellow Europoors, what's the status of the electricity/cost-of-living crisis in your hoods?\n\nFinland is getting hit less than Central Europe, but getting hit nevertheless. We haven't been \\*quite\\* as dependent on Russian power than many other countries - Russian gas was only 5 % of the energy supply, Russians cut the flow already back in May, and in general Russian electricity imports have formed 10 % of the Finnish electricity use. However, prices are still expected to rise very high in the winter, naturally the season when the society most needs electricity and has to import it.\n\nThe crisis is particularly - as everywhere else - hitting those living in detached housing. Even though district heating and, lately, geothermal are increasingly popular for heating, and an increasing amoung of air-source heat pumps have been installed there's still a lot of them relying on direct electric heating, which on current terms translates to \"pay up the nose\". Such houses might well see electricity bills hitting well over a thousand a month, unless nothing is done.\n\nAmong various issues:\n\n\\- Nordic electricity generation is reliant on water power, and though the Nordic countries haven't seen droughts on the Central European level, these are still affecting water power generation. Finland has imported electricity from Norway, and now the Norwegians are mulling restricting [electricity exports](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/22095-lintilae-norway-restricting-electricity-exports-would-play-into-putin-s-hands.html).\n\n\\- There would still be a chance to avoid the worst of it - if the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear generator goes fully online before the schedule, or at least is not delayed any more. Olkiluoto 3 has been the white whale of nuclear projects for years now, incredibly delayed and costly project that is now in test use, with those tests also frequently facing unplanned downtimes. The current estimate for Olkiluoto 3 finally starting commercial use is December 2022, but we'll see. In particular having OL3 being online and without issues would lead to stability - less need to worry about whether winter's particularly cold and how windy/sunny it is for renewables.\n\n\\- While browsing Twitter, I've seen a fair amount of what can only be described as 'schadenfreude' by pro-Russian right-wingers in various countries mocking Europeans with high energy bills and Ukraine flags in the profile photo. There's next to none of that here, as the entire Finnish society continues to be broadly pro-Ukrainian. I haven't seen any major political actors suggesting trying to make nice with Russia as a solution, of course it would be hard to do that by our lonesome anyway as long as we're a part of the EU, and Russians might tell us to pound sand anyway.\n\n\\- The environmental aspect is, of course, a big local culture war, especially in a country where much (most?) of the culture war has been environmentalism-related for a long time. It's not an easy question, non-/anti-environmentalists say that of course when you do things to drive up the costs of polluting the prices of electricity (which cannot really be produced in any way without \\*some\\* pollution) environmentalists claim that without the environmental measures the situation would be worse, comparing us to Britain where the junking of \"green crap\" led to end to insulation efforts or to countries that are more dependent on fossil fuels than us.\n\n\\- There's a back-up power reserve including, among others, Finland's last electricity-generation-oriented coal plant (other coal plants mainly generate heat). It's pretty certain that if it comes to firing up the power reserve or rolling blackouts, the power reserve is going to be fired up - that's what reserves are for, after all - but there are calls to do this already at this point with the electric bills going up, and apparently there are difficulties related to this, such as the fact that the said coal plant would need some heavy maintenance to bring back up.\n\n\\- much of the price rise is caused by market issues, Finland being a part of the European electric grid and thus being affected by the comparatively larger issues of the other countries, the sheer uncertainty of the situation hiking up the futures, and so on. Of course, if nations like Norway restrict exports, there's just going to be a domino effect with it being easier and easier for other nations to do the same when necessity calls. It's hard to see these sorts of crises as anything less than further evidence in the breakdown of globalization, unless it alternatively finally becomes the crisis the European elites can use to enact the European federation.\n\nThe government is planning measures to alleviate the crisis. Currently, the news are reporting that they're considering a measure for a tax rebate on bills over 500€ / month and a cut on the electricity VAT, as well as some less defined measure to help the poorest families and some throw-ins like doubled child benefits etc.\n\nTo me, this seems counterproductive - like tailormade to help the most energy-consumptive housing and the least-well off, but leaving large urban middle classes living in flats or in less-consumptive detached housing with only the VAT benefit. If we want to actually avoid rolling blackouts, and unless there's some measures that will lead to a lot of new electricity fast, it would seem we'd need to find some ways to reduce electricity use while ensuring that this won't break family budgets. That might mean models like guaranteeing a certain fixed price for electricity use under some ceiling and leaving market prices in force above that.",

    "body": "After failing to uncover evidence of what has been alleged as the greatest electoral fraud in the history of the world, the back-up plan for some in that camp is to display a \"tough on election fraud\" approach. But in effect, it looks like they're taking out their frustrations on random nobodies. One of those guys was Hervis Rogers, who went viral during the 2020 election for waiting in line at a polling place for six hours and being the last person to vote. He eagerly spoke to and gave his name to a TV news crew that was on site, presumably proud to showcase to the public how committed he was to voting.\n\nBut, it turns out, [Rogers was a convicted felon](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/politics/2021/07/14/the-arrest-of-hervis-rogers-brings-bail-reform-into-focus). Now 62 years old, he had been convicted of a burglary almost 3 decades prior, spent 9 years in prison, and was eventually released in 2004. But he remained on parole until June 2020, and Texas law makes it a felony for anyone to \"knowingly\" vote while still serving a parole sentence. The publicity of being broadcast as the face of the voting franchise is likely what prompted an investigation into his voting record. Although his voting rights were restored in time for the 2020 election, Rogers had somehow cast ballots on two separate occasions (in March 2020 and November 2018) while he was still on parole.\n\nTexas' Attorney General, Ken Paxton, [brought the hammer down on Rogers](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/11/texas-voter-arrested-parole/). Paxton had been one of the most enthusiastic boosters of Trump's stolen election theories, and he was responsible for filing the doomed [SCOTUS case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._Pennsylvania) in this realm. Paxton [publicized Rogers' case](https://twitter.com/kenpaxtontx/status/1413642254598688774?lang=en) as a way to flex how seriously he takes allegations of election fraud (Note: Paxton has [ongoing criminal legal issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Paxton#Legal_issues). He was indicted for securities fraud in 2015, and in 2020 several of his deputies had resigned in protest and accused him of bribery and corruption. It's likely that Paxton's enthusiasm in this area was leveraged for the purpose of seeking a presidential pardon). Rogers was arrested and held in jail on $100,000 bail. \n\nPretrial bail is [nominally intended to encourage good behavior](https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/the-poverty-trap-of-monetary-bail) from the accused while they wait for their trial. And with that in mind, it's impossible for me to appreciate how someone accused of illegally voting is somehow such a dramatic danger to the community to warrant $100k bail (especially since by the time he was arrested, Rogers' voting rights had been restored for more than a year). Sky-high bail in this case appears to have been used as a way to impose punishment *now*, regardless of the presumption of innocence, and regardless of what ends up happening to his charges down the road.\n\nBecause the facts of Rogers' situation meant that pretrial detention was very likely the only thing they ever would've gotten out of his case. It's difficult to see how the prosecution could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Rogers \"knew\" he was legally barred from voting. After all, he was able to cast ballots on two separate occasions with no issues, and he showed no hesitation about speaking to a camera crew.\n\nThe same thing is again playing out, but this time in Florida. Gov. Ron DeSantis has similarly jumped on the \"tough-on-fraud\" bandwagon and has endorsed several proposals, including advocating for a ballot signature match system [which likely would have disqualified his own voter registration](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2021/04/13/desantis-wants-voters-signatures-to-match-would-his-pass-the-test/). DeSantis recently held a press conference to announce that 20 people with felony convictions who voted in the 2020 election will be arrested and charged. This was showcased as the \"opening salvo\" for the newly minted \"Office of Election Crimes and Security\" that was created by DeSantis.\n\nBefore 2018, Florida had permanent felony disenfranchisement laws (one of only four states). The only way for a felon to regain their voting rights then was to petition the State Board of Executive Clemency. Gov. Charlie Crist had instituted a system of automatic restoration and approved 155,000 applications during his tenure. Gov. Rick Scott ended this system, and the number of approved applications plummeted to 3,000. Florida voters ended up overwhelmingly approving [Amendment 4 in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Florida_Amendment_4), which instituted automatic voting right restoration for felons \"after they complete all terms of their sentence\". That specific clause became the subject of intense litigation, and the Legislature codified that \"all terms\" included paying all outstanding fines.\n\nA persistent problem with this implementation is that nobody seems to have a good idea of when exactly \"complete all terms\" actually happens. State officials have [repeatedly admitted in court they have no good centralized system in place to make this determination](https://www.wlrn.org/news/2019-10-04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-floridas-amendment-4-lawsuit). Court records (many of which several decades old) are all over the place and poorly catalogued, with each local clerk's office using a different format. Sometimes fines are collected by multiple different government agencies, and there is no easy system in place to double-check the ledgers.\n\nThe 20 people whose arrests DeSantis touted so far appear to have been in the same situation: They were *[specifically told by election authorities that they could vote](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/26/desantis-voter-fraud-defendants-florida-00053788)*.\n\nGiven how messy Amendment 4's implementation has been, it's unclear how any normal person is expected to navigate to an answer on their own. Getting an assurance from the local election authority seems to be the best that anyone can expect. So if anyone should get into trouble, perhaps it's the local officials who messed up? That's the tack [some on the DeSantis camp](https://twitter.com/tarynfenske/status/1563261005303787521) are staking.

Those local officials approved the voting registration of people with felony convictions who by any measure appear to believe they were eligible to vote. Those people voted. Almost two years later, they get publicly arrested and dragged to jail for being dumb enough to believe someone from the government. Anyone want to defend this move?",

    "body": "I am kinda surprised that we haven't done the Duke/BYU volleyball yet.\n\nA few days ago, the Duke volleyball played a game at BYU.  The game was overshadowed by allegations of ugly racism when Duke's black starter, Rachel Richardson (I think there are several black women on the team, but only she is a starter) said that she heard someone racially abuse her throughout the match.  The player's ~~grandmother~~ godmother also took to twitter to say that the player was called the n-word \"every time she served\".\n\nThis story hit the national papers with the predictable headlines - strong denunciation against racism, praise for Rachel as a strong person standing up to adversity, denunciation of coaches and officials, athleticndepartments, the crowd at the game, and all Mormons.\n\nBYU's AD apologized profusely, and the school indefinitely banned a fan identified by Duke as the racist abuser. Rachel herself appeared on several national news stories, with the expected taking points and responses. \n\nA few days later, though, people stated asking questions.  Several students who were at the game came forward on the record to say that the racial slurs nevered happened.  Officials reviewed video of the crowd from the game, including when people claimed slurs were used - and AFAIK they've found... nothing. \n\nThere are other questions.  People started wondering why her teammates - whom one assumes both at least kinda like her (she certainly hasn't denounced any of her teammates as evil racists) , and, being 20 year old female athletes at an elite US institution are probably among the wokest people on the whole planet - haven't said anything,  as far as I've seen?\n\nDisclaimer - it's not like I've done extensive research.  But I've deen no articles writing anyone other than her or her family.   The Duke captain has an instagram that was updated two weeks ago - nothing.  All the quotes are from Richardson or her immediate family. \n\nAnd by the way - that ~~grandmother~~ godmother?  She happens to be a politician running for some office. \n\nI guess it would be hard for this story to be more unbelievable than the Duke lacrosse case (where the prosecutor was literally explicitly trying to frame some innocent kids of the right demographic, and was later disbarred),  and that was ~10 years ago, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.\n\nEdit - someone asked for links.  Disclaimer - I have a day job.  I am not claiming to be an expert or to have done extensive research as honestly, is not worth it.  But I am being honest in saying what I haven't seen.  If someone can post links that credibly contradict what I said (for examples, her teammates reacting strongly on the night of the event), I will gladly reconsider.  It's also hard to prove a negative,  and I'm certainly not going to trawl through 30 college students' instagrams.  All my links were from google or twitter, so nothing hard to find.\n\nDuke volleyball captains instagrams are easily google-able, so I'm not linking them.\n\nThe original face-value sucks are also very easy to find (abc, espn, usatoday, etc etc etc)\n\nHere are some links calling the account into question\n\nhttps://www.sltrib.com/sports/2022/08/30/fan-who-was-banned-by-byu-does/\n\nI'd *really* rather not link turtleboy sports given their culrure war angle but if nobody else is gonna cover it (and tweets are now deleted), whatcha gonna do?\n\nhttps://tbdailynews.com/video-shows-that-duke-volleyball-player-and-her-politician-godmother-are-lying-about-being-called-n-word-during-byu-game/",

It is quite long, has a number of attachments, and gives us a lot more insight into the investigation so far.\n\nMy highlights:\n\n1.  The filing includes a partially redacted photo of some of the documents seized during the search. *(Attachment F, last page of the pdf)*\n\n This photo will be the front page of basically every paper tomorrow, and was certainly a conscious choice to include as it looks extremely damning.  There are a bunch of documents with really blatant cover sheets and TOP SECRET // SCI printed in 36 point red font multiple times.\n\n2.  The filing also gives us a copy of the subpoena that was issued on May 11 of this year, and the response provided on June 3. *(attachments C and E)*\n\n The subpoena demanded:\n\n &gt;Any and all documents or writings in the custody or control of Donald J. Trump and/or the Office of\nDonald J. Trump bearing classification markings, including but not limited to the following: Top Secret,\nSecret , Confidential, Top Secret/ SI- G/NOFORN/ ORCON , Top Secret/ SI-G/NOFORN, Top Secret/HCS\nO /NOFORN/ ORCON, Top Secret/ HCS- /NOFORN, Top Secret/HCS- P/NOFORN/ ORCON,\nSecret/ HCS- P/NOFORN, Top Secret/ TK/ NOFORN/ ORCON, Top Secret/ TK/ NOFORN,\nSecret NOFORN, Confidential/ NOFORN, TS , TS / SAP , TS / SI-G/NF/OC , TS / SI- G/ NF, TS/ HCS\nO/ NF/ OC, TS/ HCS- O/NF, TS/ HCS- P/NF/ OC , TS / HCS-P/ NF, TS/ HCS- P/ SI- G, TS / HCS- P/ SI/ TK ,\nTS/ TK/NF/ OC , TS/ TK/NF, S/ NF, S / FRD , S /NATO, S / SI, C , and C /NF\n\n The response said:\n\n &gt;Based upon the information that has been provided to me ,I am authorized to certify , on\nbehalf of the Office of Donald J. Trump , the following :\n\n &gt;a. A diligent search was conducted of the boxes that were moved from the White\nHouse to Florida;\n\n &gt;b. This search was conducted after receipt of the subpoena, in order to locate any\nand all documents that are responsive to the subpoena;\n\n &gt;c. Any and all responsive documents accompany this certification; and\n\n &gt; d. No copy, written notation, or reproduction of any kind was retained as to any\nresponsive document.\n\n &gt;I swear or affirm that the above statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\n\n The response to the subpoena was to produce a single envelope, double wrapped in tape, which contained 38 documents with different classification markings.\n\n3.  DoJ says they found classified documents in Trump's office desk in the drawer which contained his passports, *(p. 12)* which was the reason his passports were seized.  The warrant told them to seize all contents of any containers that have classified information.\n\n4. DoJ says multiple times *(p. 4 and 8)* that at no point prior to the execution of the search warrant execution did Trump claim he had declassified any of these documents despite numerous opportunities to do so.\n\n5. DoJ hints at some specific evidence about documents being moved around Mar-A-Lago beyond what's known so far.  In particular they say *(p. 10)*:\n\n &gt;Through further investigation, the FBI uncovered multiple sources of evidence\nindicating that the response to the May 11 grand jury subpoena was incomplete and that\nclassified documents remained at the Premises, notwithstanding the sworn certification made\nto the government on June 3. In particular, the government developed evidence that a search\nlimited to the Storage Room would not have uncovered all the classified documents at the\nPremises. The government also developed evidence that government records were likely\nconcealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct\nthe government’s investigation. ... This included evidence indicating that boxes formerly in the Storage Room\nwere not returned prior to counsel’s review.\n\n6. DoJ says they have finished their privilege review for attorney/client privilege already, and do not think executive privilege can possibly apply, and did not filter for it.",

I don't detect much sneering, mostly specific disagreements with specific things.  \n\n2. Sam Altman (OpenAI) re-tweeting that list of lethalities post (would link but short on time rn, easily found if you scroll back far enough)\n\n3. Stability AI (of Stable Diffusion fame) is related to EleutherAI in some capacity. There's definitely a lot of personnel overlap. Emad (head of Stability AI, someone Ilforte has spoken very fondly of) has retweeted various LW posts ([1)](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1563715319566409729) and has [retweeted this job ad](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1512405527350943746) from Conjecture, the Alignment focused spin-off of EleutherAI, founded by Connor Leahy, seems to have alignment takes that are not far from Yud's, as you can tell if you either watch his interview on a [recent podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz4G9zrlAGs&amp;ab_channel=TheInsideView) or simply read his feed. \n\nnote: These are three differnet organizations, all with relatively diverse views on AI, especially Stability AI vs the others. \n\n\n**What is the point of this post?**\n\nIlforte is an extremely eloquent writer. He is probably the most talented (certainly the most compelling! though IMO his prose is often far from lucid...) prose writer currently active on /themotte. And yet he seems to have a completely evidence-free view on the possible danger of AGI, has a deeply suspicious view of Yud, who, for all of his many flaws, is so bad at hiding his own views that he spends all of his weirdness points debating PR-toxic topics like baby qualia-- (you can accuse Yud of a few things, but a talented dissassembler for the sake of other goals he definitely is not...)\n\nIlforte seems to have decided to direct all of his immense verbal talent to deriding pessimistic takes on AGI, and I think this bad. I think a redteaming of paranoid takes on AI is great, but Ilforte has often made his arguments mostly through suspicion of AI-suspicious people.\n\nI think its time someone pointed at this argument directly and engaged with it. I'm not that person, unfortunately, because I'm drowning in work rn, but I'm planting a flag here and hoping Ilforte and others can debate productively about ways that [suspicious of AGI] and [suspicious of those who are suspicious of AGI] can productively disagree and understand the world better.",

    "body": "**There's Still a TJ Test, Actually**\n\nThe [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology) is a magnet STEM-focused high school in Northern Virginia established in 1985. The school has special facilities meant to provide opportunities for students who show achievement and passion for STEM and who will eventually pursue careers in science, engineering, or medicine. It has courses in things like artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics, DNA science, and machine learning. It also has several labs where students can do research projects. It was [ranked](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/virginia/districts/fairfax-county-public-schools/thomas-jefferson-high-school-for-science-and-technology-20461) as the best school in the country in 2022. \n\nUntil recently, TJ admitted students through a competitive process similar to the college admissions process in which prior academic achievement, teacher recommendations, and an exam similar to the SAT played a major role. The school had a low proportion of black and Hispanic students who were admitted, and this was long a complaint of left-wing activists who advocate reforms to the admissions process so that more non-Asian minorities would be admitted. In particular, they blamed the admissions exam for eliminating most such students from consideration.\n\nIn 2020, those activists got their way. The school board voted to eliminate the admissions test in [October 2020](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/thomas-jefferson-high-admissions-change/2020/10/07/0a1f8faa-08a7-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html) and later that year made other reforms to the admissions process, including setting minimum quotas for admission at the middle school level and adding \"experience factors\" to the process. The [class of students](https://www.fcps.edu/news/tjhsst-offers-admission-550-students-broadens-access-students-who-have-aptitude-stem) admitted the next year went from being 4.52% black and Hispanic to 18.36%. \n\nAn advocacy group opposed to the 2020 changes [sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_for_TJ_v._Fairfax_County_School_Board), alleging the changes discriminated against Asian Americans, whose share of admitted students decreased from 73.05% to 54.36%. The case is currently pending before the appeals court.\n\nOne thing I realized while I was researching this is that there actually still is a test that influences your probability of admission to TJ. One of the \"experience factors\" that increases a student's odds of being admitted in the [new admissions process](https://www.fcps.edu/registration/thomas-jefferson-high-school-science-and-technology-admissions/tjhsst-freshman) is whether they are an English Language Learner (ELL). An [ELL is a student](https://wida.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/resource/explaining-ell-status-english.pdf) who has extra support learning English in school. How do schools identify which students need extra support learning English?\n\nWell, there's a test. Schools administer an English skills test and students who perform poorly on it are identified as ELL and offered extra instruction in special classes for ELLs. \n\nWhat this means for TJ is that a student's chance of being admitted to an elite school for the academically excellent is *increased* if they perform *poorly* enough on evaluations of their language skills.\n\nThe reason the school board added this consideration is obvious: The [large majority (78%)](https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/el-characteristics/index.html#four) of ELLs are Hispanic, so preferring ELLs in the admissions process is a way to increase the proportion of Hispanics admitted without needing to add race to the admissions process explicitly (which would be more easily challenged legally). Asians make up 11% of ELLs too, but it's notable that Hispanics outnumber Asians among ELLs by 7:1 but only by about 3:1 in the general population ([6.1% vs. 18.9%](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045221)). A lot of Asian kids speak two languages but their parents made sure they were good enough with English that they don't need any special instruction.\n\nThis is just... so backwards. I don't think it would be fair to prefer students who speak more than one language in admission to TJ. But I could see an argument for it: Students who successfully learned a second language and succeeded enough to be equally or almost equally academically impressive as students who speak English natively have done something really impressive, now that they've mastered the lingua franca, they'll probably shine even brighter. In fact, this describes a large proportion of the students admitted to TJ under the old process. But that's not what they're doing with this new process. They're specifically preferring the students who were *least* successful at learning the new language, the ones who struggled the *most* with it. \n\nOn top of that, immigrant families who were responsible and ~~paid off their student loans~~ taught their kids English fluency and saved the taxpayer-funded school system the extra burden of dealing with kids who don't know English are punished, while the ones who depended on the government for that are rewarded.\n\nWell, expect an increase in enrollment in ELL programs in Fairfax County of kids who seem to be speak pretty good English most of the time.",

Krugman's mostly calling out Republican hypocrisy in one form or another (fine as far as it goes), but the substantive part follows:\n\n&gt;The Biden administration says that its plan will provide relief to as many as 43 million Americans. That’s a lot of people, not a small, cosseted elite.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;even if you subscribe to the Trump diner theory of politics — according to which the only voters who matter are blue-collar guys wearing baseball caps — you should be aware that some of those guys probably took out loans to attend trade schools or community colleges, all too often getting nothing but debt in return. Even among those who didn’t take out student loans, many probably have children, siblings, cousins or friends who did. So the Biden plan will touch many people.\n\nDynarski's article focuses on the borrowers hardest hit.\n\n&gt;Defaults and financial distress are concentrated among the millions of students who drop out without a degree. The financial prospects for college dropouts are poor; they earn little more than do workers with no college education ...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And dropout is not at all rare. A bit less than half of college students don’t earn a bachelor’s degree. Some people earn a shorter, two-year associate degree. But more than a quarter of those who start college hoping to earn a degree drop out with no credential.\n\nIf we take those articles at face value \\[0\\], we're talking about a program that provides relief to about 13 million Americans that fit a very sympathetic profile and badly need it - and a bonanza for another 30 million people, most of whom do not need that relief. \\[1\\]\n\n**Would Anyone Support Country Club Loan Relief?**\n\nLet's pretend for a moment that a Republican administration instituted a program subsidizing country club membership. After all, a lot of businesses are built and supported by the informal networks around country clubs, plus people that belong to country clubs tend to be successful.\n\nSo picture that: 60-70% of the borrowers do pretty well for themselves. Their businesses improve and they get richer. However, a substantial minority of the loan recipients don't have access to high-quality country clubs with their impressive facilities and wealthy cohorts. 30-40% take out loans to join municipal clubs or some strange off-brand variation called into being by the amount of money pumped into the system. The people do not flourish, their businesses do not succeed.\n\nI don't think many people would stand for a country club relief program for both groups, and I don't think the New York Times would publish multiple defenses of the program in the space of a week.\n\nThis comparison might not sound fair, especially if you went to community college or commuter school (to say nothing of a for-profit college), but I promise it is directionally accurate.\\[2\\]\n\nAt liberal arts colleges, most private universities, and flagship state schools (at least), you get unbelievable amenities for your money. It's not just the oft-ridiculed climbing walls and lazy rivers - I'm talking about the basics, the features of college that predate the crazy expansion of the last thirty (?) years: access to first-rate facilities, people paid to serve you, people paid to do your dishes, and on top of all that, excellent event programming so that, if your studies ever bore you, you'll still be stimulated.\n\nUltimately, I'm shocked that so many early reactions to this involve a shrug, or (worse) approval of the policy, seemingly based on the sympathetic profile of a minority of beneficiaries, though maybe that's my naivete. Another writer here (responding to Trace's post, I think) wrote convincingly that people probably just conceive of this as \"free college\" rather than debt. That's an idea that's probably more popular than \"free country clubs\" (and definitely more popular than \"free country clubs for the rich\"), but I'm not sure it deserves the support.\n\n\\[0\\] People that have some college but no degree already do moderately better than people with a high-school diploma, [per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm), or [this Northeastern University study](https://www.northeastern.edu/bachelors-completion/news/average-salary-by-education-level), or any of the dozens of links that pop up when you start to research education and income.\n\n\\[1\\] \"More than a quarter\" = 30% \\* Krugman's \"43 million Americans\", then round it up.\n\n\\[2\\] Apart from, of course, the educational experience. But I must say, this is easy to overstate, especially if you've been [Fred-pilled](https://substack.com/profile/12666725-freddie-deboer).",

She's clearly coming from a woke perspective — \"I only date people on the left; I guess that makes me 'rightphobic', but I'm okay with that,\" lol. But she's also far more nuanced than your typical Twitter SJW (is there a less-dated noun for That Type? anyway)\n\nSome notable excerpts, emphasis added by me:\n\n&gt; **A society that rejects transgender people’s bodies as valid is also one that deeply fetishizes them.** As a trans woman, most of the men I’d describe as “chasers” are men who get off on the social taboo of sleeping with transgender women and the fact that no one knows what they’re doing. Partially because they’re ashamed, but also because the secret excites them. Their secrecy also maintains their chances with cis women, who tend to be their preference. These men know that a lot of cis women would be repulsed if they knew they were attracted to transgender women, and this is the excuse they give for treating trans women how they do. Unfortunately, most chasers are in the position they’re in because they saw a trans woman who challenged their understanding of self, and they slowly but surely developed the habit of secretly consuming transgender pornography and contacting transgender women. They were curious, but then they learned they can prey on a group of people who are so used to not being preferred that they are often willing to go the extra mile to satisfy those who have privilege over them. **In fact, because transgender women know that they are rarely preferred over cis women, the attention of cis men is very validating to transgender women who are in an insecure phase of life. It’s not uncommon for transgender women to feel flattered by the affection of a man who identifies as heterosexual because, to them the expression of attraction is also a validation of them as women.** So, you have a group of heterosexual men who might otherwise be unimpressive whose inherent quality is now seen as impressive long before anything else is established. Some men become intoxicated by the idea that all they have to do is say they’re straight and gorgeous transgender women, who haven’t quite found their worth, will overlook all of their flaws, all of the reasons other women have rejected them all to feel more proximity to their privilege. This often leads to some very toxic and abusive dynamics that are very stressful for transgender women. **These men are actively attracted to them and choose to mistreat them because they are transgender. For me, that will always feel more transphobic than someone simply saying no to me.**\n\n---\n\n&gt; Who men tend to prefer becomes very obvious when you are polyamorous. **I’ve dated men of various racial backgrounds who all denied they had a preference but were often primary partnered to cis white women. If they weren’t when I met them, almost all of them left or paused their relationships with me because of a new, cis white partner.** Removing monogamy from the conversation, allows for these things to be seen more clearly because a monogamous person could easily argue that it’s a coincidence that they just so happened to fall in love with someone who fits the idealized beauty standard. When you live in a very diverse city and all of your partners are that idealized beauty standard, it’s obvious you have a preference; but these people will deny it. **If you went to a Polyamory social and lined up every woman who was primary partnered, most of them will be cis and white; that’s not a coincidence. You’ll notice the “secondary” partners tend to be a bit darker skinned, often more queer, sometimes less cis than their primary. Often times, men primary their “preference” and keep their curiosities or the less socially acceptable partners as secondaries. To this day, I have never met a cis man primary partnered to a transgender woman with a cis woman as a secondary, but I have been the transgender secondary partner for many polyamorous men in LA.** If you were to ask these men if they had a preference, they would absolutely say no, but you see their preferences clear as day and you notice how when new women of color come to the event, they don’t get swarmed with attention the same way a white girl would. None of these socially aware, left leaning people want to say that they have a preference, but they do. But being a bit graceful, another aspect of “preference” that isn’t often discussed is that sometimes their “preference” really isn’t even their own. \n\nThere are a couple poly people here, right? Hoping you can comment on whether her perception matches yours as well. Not because I don't believe her — sounds very plausible — but because scene dynamics can vary, regionally and otherwise, so I'm curious.\n\nOverall, the territory she treads in this essay is familiar — it's the madonna-whore dichotomy, the difference between a good-time girl and the one you take home to mama. I can imagine it's very frustrating to be sorted into the \"whore\" category sheerly because of your demographic. Last excerpt:\n\n&gt; Maybe it’s because I date men, but my experience with being less preferred has often been that I’m placed in a position where my intimate partners mistreat me and expect me to stay because they know I’m less preferred. It took me a while to understand that white men like my ex who very performatively trash white women to uplift women of color are doing so out of bitterness and a history of rejection. A lot of times when these men have low self-esteem, they’ll pursue someone they know they have more privilege than to prey on theirs instead. **Through our relationship, I knew he had insecurities, but I didn’t make the connection that those insecurities meant that he was intimidated by the white women he preferred and that he saw me as easier to connect with because I existed outside of most people’s preferences.** When he spoke about white women, it was always about how they were too prissy or high maintenance. He’d complain about women who had standards and were willing to say no and not settle for less. In retrospect, I can see that he knew he’d get away with relying on me financially because perhaps subconsciously, I did buy into the idea that a relationship with him was flattering, and I didn’t want to walk away from it. Chasers will often trash cis women in a similar way. They’ll talk about how much more feminine trans women are and how bitchy and stuck up cis women are. It’s all constructed to prey on the insecurities they know society promotes within you. These are often relationships where I’m expected to do a lot and to put up with more shit than the women they prefer. I cannot even believe that I spent all of this money in my last relationship providing for a man who is far more privileged than I’ll ever be, but that’s often the position you end up in. **These men often expect you to do more labor for them because you do not have the same bargaining power as their preference. I’ve seen men who were broke for me, be rich for their preference.** These relationships always left me feeling depleted and the only reason I speak so much about them is that they’ve left me with lasting trauma that has very viciously affected me and made me so fearful of men and their true desires. For that reason, it’s hard for me to hear conversations that attribute bigotry to someone rejecting someone they do not prefer. **I struggle to buy into the idea that because a man is attracted to me, he’s less bigoted than the men who reject me on the basis of who I am and leave me alone. I wish so many of my former intimate partners simply left me alone and pursued their preferences until one stuck. I wish they’d stop using me as a stop gap between relationships with the kind of women they prefer.** I wish I could stop being in relationships where I’m expected to settle for less, because of who I am. I cannot remember every man who’s rejected me for being a trans woman, but to this day, I feel the pain of being so intimate with men who mistreated me because I’m a transgender woman.\n\nI definitely sympathize with the issue of having your low self-esteem used as manipulation leverage within an intimate relationship, by someone who is doing that shit because they too have low self-esteem (whether the self-assessment, by either party, is warranted or not).\n\nAnother theme of the essay, not emphasized as much in the longer passages that I quoted, is the degree to which desire is culturally mediated. She writes, \"What I dislike about this discourse is that on one hand it acknowledges that the type of people we're attracted to is linked to our socialization, but it downplays the depth of that socialization.\"\n\nAs for myself, I don't really have a point here. I thought her perspective — her inside view of dating as a black trans woman — was very interesting. I def encourage you to read the [whole post](https://blaqueinthecity.com/2022/05/21/dating-preferences-and-the-painful-burden-of-being-less-preferred-but-always-desired-2/).\n\nThoughts? I know you'll have 'em ;P",

    "body": "**\"Christianity built western civilization\"** \n\nDid it? What does this actually mean? It is a sentiment I encounter often. Including on this subreddit in the course of a discussion a few days/weeks ago (most articulately elucidated by /u/FCfromSSC). \n\nIt usually comes up in arguments between Christian and non-Christian right-wingers. e.g:\n\n\"Christianity is a cringe cuck Asiatic soy religion\" \n\n\"Actually Christianity is heckin based and redpilled and built western civilization.\" \n\nI disagree with the proposition, or at least, I am pretty sure I do. \n\nI think \"Christianity built western civilization\" can be interpreted a number of ways. \n\nFirst, and least charitably, it could be taken to mean that Christianity has had a very great influence on western civilization over the course of the past, say, fifteen centuries. This is undeniable. There would be no Gothic cathedrals, no *Divine Comedy* without Christianity. Sure. But I don't think this is what is meant by \"Christianity built western civilization.\" Because this is a very tautological and uninteresting interpretation of the proposition. If not for Christianity, European civilization would not bear a Christian stamp. Sure. So what?\n\nThere is a stronger interpretation, which is that Christianity added something (or some*things*) to European civilization which, while not explicitly Christian, it would not have had without Christianity. For example, it sometimes said that the scientific method is rooted in a Christian worldview (I happen to think this is absurd). However, I could still probably agree with this. European civilization would certainly have been very different without Christianity. Fun as counterfactuals are, we will never know precisely *how* it would have been different, but it certainly would have been, and many of these differences would probably have been subtle and not immediately tied to the absence of Christianity. \n\nThe strongest interpretation of the proposition, and the one I believe its defenders are adhering to, is something like, \"European civilization is/was *great* and its *greatness* is entirely or largely owed to Christianity.\" This is the interpretation I strongly *disagree* with. \n\nIt depends on what you think is (or was) *great* about European civilization. If you are a Christian, and you say, \"Christianity is true, and therefore a civilization that exemplifies Christian morals and virtue is great,\" then we have a very deep disagreement, because I *don't* think Christianity is true. The argument will have to be suspended while we dig down to a deeper level and argue about the truth of Christianity. \n\nBut most defenders of the proposition don't tend to argue so bluntly. In my experience, they attempt to find common ground with the non-Christian RWer by which they can persuade them that the greatness of European civilization, agreed upon by both parties, can be credited to Christianity. \n\nSo what made European civilization great? In my view it is obvious. \n\nFirst and foremost, strength and power. Various nations of Europe subjected a greater portion of the world than any before them. All of the Americas, all of Africa (save a few stubborn states), great swathes of Asia. It was a feat unequalled in world history, and \"great\" by any reasonable measure. \n\nSecondly, artistic and cultural achievement. It is obvious that Europe has been the world center for great art for the past several centuries. I confess I am no connoisseur, but *The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa* has left me in awe since high school. To say nothing of architecture, literature, etc. \n\nThirdly, scientific achievement. Again, it is quite indisputable that Europe has been the center of scientific and technological excellence for the past several centuries. Northwestern Europe, in particular. No industrial revolution without England. \n\nSo the question is, to what extent was Christianity responsible for any of these three?\n\nI believe the answer is \"barely,\" or \"not at all,\" since Europe was leading in all three even before Christianization. If anything there was something of a backslide on all three metrics in the early middle ages. I'm not trying to resurrect \"hole left by the Christian dark ages,\" but if Christianity had a stimulating effect on European greatness you would not expect its proliferation to coincide with the political, cultural, economic, and artistic decay that characterized late antiquity and the early medieval period. \n\nThis argument is usually capped off with something along the lines of, \"well, you're just a LARPer, western civilization has been Christian for centuries so trying to resurrect pagan Greece or Rome is just dumb and pointless.\" Which may be true, but is also a huge self-own considering how many online Christian RWers are trad monarchist LARPer types. One might as easily say, \"well, the west has been liberal democratic for two centuries, now. Trying to resurrect catholic monarchy is just dumb and pointless.\" Or bring it even further down to date. \"Trying to resurrect the 1950s is dumb and pointless, that was more than half a century ago. Move on, stop LARPing.\" You get the point. \n\nI am aware that today, the great majority of western conservatives are Christian or at least Christian adjacent. In real life, I don't call Christian conservatives cringe and tell them they should be worshipping the Olympians. That would, indeed, be silly and pointless. I am happy to make common cause with Christian RWers IRL. But this is an argument I get into regularly in niche internet spaces, and I happen to think I have the better part of it. I am curious what the users of this subreddit think, since this is after all one of the niche internet spaces in which I have had this and related arguments. \n\nSIDENOTE: the also-common argument that \"Christianity united Europe\" is not addressed above because it is almost too stupid for words. After the dissolution of pagan Rome, Europe was never so united again until the 20th century. Christian Europeans spent centuries warring with their fellow Christian Europeans. And of course during the Based Crusades™ another set of Based Crusaders was up north slaughtering Baltic pagans. Not that any of this matters because pan-European nationalism is dumb in most contexts anyways.",

    "body": "How many people here can hold an emotion for 10 minutes?\n\nSam Harris had a quote recently where he said ' 10 minutes of anger can really fuck up your life ' and I understood it to be obviously true. But how many people can actually hold an emotion that long? I've held sadness twice for a longer period of time: once when a long term gf and I broke up, and once when my best friend killed themselves. I also get angry in spurts - browsing Reddit sometimes does it or hearing peoples various political opinions I disagree with or know that are incorrect - but it's just a spur of the moment issue. Another example is sports. I love sports but I really never get too up or too down about my teams performance; there's always next year + being a Marlins and Dolphins fan that would just be an outlet to constant anger. Otherwise, pretty much every other emotion is just done after what seems like several seconds. \n\nThis leads me to question if otherwise I am emotionally comatose the majority of my life? \n\nNow Sam was talking about it in relation (I believe) of criminality and, as always, of free will and I'm talking about it more on a personal level, and that's what I'd like to hear feedback on: how long do you hold onto emotions? And how does this impact your life daily and in general?",

    "body": "Lost in the shuffle last week was an interview between [Trump’s AG Bill Barr]( https://www.commonsense.news/p/bill-barr-calls-bullsht) and Bari Weiss. I don’t normally enjoy writing about this kind of piece because of how heated people can get, but I found this interesting enough that I’ll give it a go.\n\nTl;dr: Likes:  \n-\tTrump, the president \n-\tThe right’s interpretation of Russiagate  \n-\tRepublicans  \n-\tJoe Manchin and Stephen Breyer  \nDislikes:  \n-\tTrump, the person  \n-\tProgressives (unclear to me how wide a net this casts)  \n-\tPolitical tribalism  \n\nBarr tells a few stories that echo what has come out about the Trump administration in a number of books and other sources. Stories like this one:\n\n&gt;AG BARR: It was on June 1 when the president was bellowing at a number of his cabinet secretaries, especially the military guys—the secretary and chairman of the joint chiefs. He was calling all of us “fucking losers” at the top of his lungs. \nOr this one, where he tried to resign over the allegations Trump was making of election fraud:\n&gt;AG BARR: He was in a little dining room that adjoins the Oval Office. He was as furious as I’d ever seen him. He confronted me and said, “Did you say this to the AP?” And I said, “I did. Because it was the truth.” I went over some of the allegations. He said there was plenty of evidence of fraud. I explained in some detail why the allegations didn’t fly. I told him that there were only five or six weeks to challenge a presidential election because the Constitution requires the Electoral College to meet at a certain date and he didn’t have much time. He’d already wasted five of your six weeks with this crazy stuff about the Dominion machines. He’d wheeled out this clown show of lawyers that no reputable lawyer is willing to work with.  \n&gt;I said, “Look, I know you’re unhappy with me. I’m going to tender my resignation.” And he slammed the table. Everyone jumped. And he said, “Accepted.” So I said OK and left. I was getting into my car right outside the White House and all of a sudden, people started pounding on the windows. It was late at night and raining, so it was sort of this eerie thing. The president sent Cipollone, another White House lawyer, out there, to retrieve me and tell me “Nevermind, he’s not going to fire you, and would you come back in?” And I said, “I don't think there's any use to going back in tonight. I’m going to go home. But we can talk about it in the morning.” \n\nI suppose it depends how much credence you lend to his version of events over Trump’s. Barr genuinely seems to like what Trump did while in office, though, if that moves your needle towards believing him. I won’t link those quotes due to space concerns. He also doesn’t lend any credence to the election fraud theories:\n\n&gt;AG BARR: I was somewhat demoralized that he was leaving office this way. The left says, “Oh, you said all these nice things about him in your resignation.” But I felt that what he should do was focus on all his achievements and leave with dignity. Whether he thought there was fraud or not, he had his day in court and he lost.  \n&gt;So I was demoralized that he was going out the way he was. I thought it was very unfair to all the people, especially the younger people, who had worked in the administration. It hurt them getting jobs and it also hurt the Republican Party, which I thought up until then, could take the high ground as the party of law and order.  \n&gt;I would say it [the January 6th riot] was an effort to intimidate Congress and the vice president. I haven’t heard words from the president that I would consider incitement under the law. That’s a very high bar because of our First Amendment, and it should be a high bar. But I did feel that he was morally responsible for it because he led these people to believe that something could happen on Capitol Hill that would reverse the election. That there’s something they could do involving pressuring the vice president and Congress that would overturn the election. \n\nBarr also says a number of things about politics that make me think that compromise and a rapprochement are possible. Perhaps I’m projecting, but he seems to argue against reactionary politics and towards something more constructive:\n\n&gt;Something I’m pretty tired of from the right is the constant pandering to outrage. The picking and picking at the scab without trying to channel those feelings in a constructive direction. In my opinion, Ronald Reagan was a great populist not because he followed the frustrated instincts and the outrage of the people, but because he channeled it and was constructive with it…We have these institutions that need reform. The first step is to win an election with a decisive majority that allows you to put a program into effect and fix some of these problems going forward. That is not done by just throwing fuel on the fire of outrage on one side of the equation while the other side does the same thing on their side…I think we should basically try to persuade people. People like Youngkin, the Governor of Virginia, have shown that the Republican Party is a potential majority party.  \n&gt;The problem with Trump is that it’s all about running a base election. Whip up your base, get them all upset and outraged, and turn them out at the polls. Both sides do that. That is a prescription for continued hostility and demoralization of the country. The first side to break out of that will do so by restoring politics to what it should be, which is the politics of trying to capture a majority of the people through persuasion and with a decisive enough majority to change things…I say to the people that want to make America great again, “What will it take to do that?” You don’t do it just by making your base madder and madder.  \n\nAnd yet, at the same time, the way he talks about liberals is depressing:\n\n&gt;although we’ve been sort of harping on the warts of Trumpism, I think the greatest threat to the country is the radical progressive movement and what it’s degenerated into. In 2016, had there been another Democratic administration, I was concerned that we’d have dug an even deeper hole that would be much harder to get out of. I think Trump did serve a historic purpose: He was sort of the wrecking ball and against progressive excess. People were mad about it, and they wanted a no-nonsense person who would be a wrecking ball, and he did that. What I’m saying now is that we need something different moving forward. I give him credit for identifying people’s frustrations and being willing to call out some of the progressive excess that other people were cowering about then.  \n\n&gt;If we’ve left it behind, I don't think this ends well for the country. I don't see that this leads to any future for the country. I think we have to return to that if we’re going to have a future. I put this on the doorstep of the radical progressives as their responsibility. They’re the ones who have sharply shifted. The political model before this was the liberal democratic spectrum where you have right and left, but we’re all within the liberal, democratic, Anglo-American political tradition.  \n\n&gt;What we’ve moved to is a bipolar system that’s more typical of revolutionary countries, where you have a party like the Marxists or some other totalitarian party trying to take power. It’s all or nothing and anything goes. It’s war by other means. That’s where we are, and it doesn’t end well.  \n\n&gt;Those of us who are traditional conservatives, Reagan conservatives––I grew up on Bill Buckley and so forth––believe in the Anglo-American system of politics. We have a First Amendment that allows citizens to debate and come to some consensus for the public good. One of the things that bothers me is that people talk about democracy and the threat to democracy. Well, what did the framers think was the threat to democracy? In Federalist 10, Madison says it’s when the majority uses democracy to oppress the minority. When someone takes a transient 51% majority and tries to ram things down the throat of the other 49%, and now we’re finding ourselves sort of oscillating between those two worlds. Get 51 votes, good: Obamacare. You have 51 votes and you shove it down people’s throats. Whereas the institutions that we’ve had before this were meant to require some form of consensus and incremental change. They allowed people to build up some consensus for an approach, and things moved slowly. That’s not good enough for revolutionaries, who want to tear things down or change things instantaneously. I think that’s the basic challenge we face right now.\n\nautomod_multipart_lockme",

Still there has been an idea I have been developing for a while.\n\nIt was always easy to dismiss as toxic masculinity, motivated by misogyny and sexism. This may be to some extent true but I propose a different framing that unites all the disparate factions even though I don't think they realize so themselves. It's about the male gender role. It's no secret that the traditional male gender role is not what it used to be. Between the state and women in the workforce the provider is largely obsolete and the feminism friendly attempts to construct a new one are just unappealing and don't really address mens desires at all. How the factions differ is their reaction to that.\n\nRedpill sometimes gets accused of being patriarchal and while some are certainly sympathetic to it (though I think part of that faction has split off into the newer tradlarpers) they instead decide feel that women don't live up to their standards and *enjoy the decline* becoming philanderers instead. The archetype of philanderer did exist but it was never considered something commendable or worth emulating under traditional conventions. The MGTOW are pretty similar, but they decide to quit altogether. MRA try to renegotiate their place using more conventional activist tactics to get the legal recognition framing it in the terms of *rights* in parallel to women. I think what both are really getting at is that women don't want to hold up their end of the bargain, but still expect men to do theirs and that's fundamentally unfair. Traditional gender roles might have given men some power that could be abused but it also came with responsibilities that remain unrecognized, even as women got *liberated* from theirs. \n\nI think this is a discussion we should have, but unfortunately men constructing a new narrative is hostile to modern feminism. When you're accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression, as they say.",
