    "body": "**On not assimilating**\n\nPeople here often complain that minorities coming from third world countries don't assimilate into western culture and keep up their own cultural traditions from back home and do not mix with the natives to any significant degree. When you tell them that white \"expats\" are just as guilty of the exact same behaviours the standard refrain is that the expats aren't going to permanently live in their new country and so it's fine, and besides they are net contributors to the economies of the foreign countries so they should be grateful of such people.\n\nHowever this fails to account for the large  number of e.g. white retirees from countries like the UK that go off to spend their dotage in a place like Spain with more sun and less rain. These \"expats\" are going off to permanently live the rest of their lives in their new countries and are a net drain on public finances because of all the healthcare expenditure associated with old age. Also, the pensioner emigres also display the exact same insular behaviour of not learning the languages/creating their own internal communities they spend all their time in that third world immigrants/expats do. And yet, we do not see anywhere near the amount of criticism of this behaviour from westerners that they dispense towards minority immigrants doing the exact same stuff. To me this feels extremely hypocritical and something that should be called out.\n\nEDIT: I'm getting lots of replies in the form of \"pensioners don't have kids which makes it all completely different\" and I can't help but be reminded of a common tactic I see (principally from the left) where they say \"X is true\" and you counter with \"what about situation Y where X is not true\" and they then say \"but in Y there is factor Z so it doesn't count\" where they never ever brought up factor Z during their initial \"X is true\" statement. I think that is bad reasoning, and equally I think this too is bad reasoning, you're looking for minute differences between the situation I presented and that of immigrants to the west and saying that those differences render my argument invalid.",

The author also argues [against](https://medium.com/@akhivae/demography-is-not-destiny-the-problem-with-demographic-reductionism-44d092f2e52c) the significance of demographics.\n\nA counter might be that both these societies are facing a  \"demographic clog\" and home a lot more people than they could afford to. Its also worth noting that in both these countries are moving out of agriculture and more education and other resources are going to be required for children. Not to mention, abortion has been legal in India for decades now. Private schooling is also extremely expensive yet very vital for upward mobility, since the public education infrastructure is kafkaesque, which probably also limits fertility. I think demographic decline is inevitable but perhaps religiosity can slow the decline in sustainable proportions and avoid a South Korea style age quake.",

    "body": "**More drama in the Canadian Conservative party leadership race**\n\nI've written several posts on the troubles of Canada's Conservative party ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/sgv76g/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_january_31/hvg0wzx/?context=999), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/sbg7zr/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_january_24/huo263m/?context=999), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/k8bxy1/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_december_07/gf783sz/?context=999), and presumably elsewhere as well). They're in the middle of a leadership campaign right now, with Pierre Poilievre as the favourite. I've described him as the Canadian equivalent of Ben Shapiro: young, scrappy, no life experience outside of politics, sort of a partisan attack dog, makes youtube compilations of owning the Libs, etc. He's primarily being opposed by two more moderate candidates: Jean Charest and Patrick Brown. All three candidates were engaged in a veritable arms race of fundraising and signing up new party members to vote.\n\nOr I should say Poilievre *was* being opposed by two moderate candidates. The Conservative Party announced two days ago that Patrick Brown was [being expelled from the leadership contest](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/patrick-brown-ouster-vassy-kapelos-1.6512385) for vague claims of breaching the Elections Act; today a whistleblower came forward to claim that Brown was knowingly using [private funds to pay campaign staff.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/whistleblow-brown-disqualification-payment-1.6514122)\n\nNow this might normally be your typical scandal. But it's creating a lot of speculation because this isn't the first time that Patrick Brown has been conveniently ousted for a more \"true blue\" candidate. In 2018 he was the leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative party heading into a provincial election he was projected to win in a landslide, when, several months before the vote there [emerged allegations of sexual misconduct](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/patrick-brown-resigns-ontario-pc-1.4503040), and within hours his entire staff had quit. He resigned the next day despite protesting his innocence, and was ultimately replaced by Doug Ford (brother of the dearly departed Rob, and still the Ontario Premier). Ultimately the allegations against Brown all fell apart under scrutiny, and he [won a settlement against CTV News for defamation.](https://globalnews.ca/news/8670496/patrick-brown-story-ctv-correction/) (This is just gossip, but pretty much everyone in the know thinks this episode was a coup orchestrated by Vic Fedeli to oust Brown and prevent him from becoming Premier).\n\nSo for Brown to be the victim of yet *another* conveniently timed scandal raises some eyebrows. In fact, the timing is so convenient that [his name will remain on the ballots](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/conservative-party-not-printing-new-ballots-despite-patrick-brown-s-disqualification-1.5976994) despite being disqualified. \n\nI'm not sure what's true in this story. I must say I have a bias towards Brown and against Poilievre, and certainly it stinks to high heaven that his is happening to him *again*. This isn't the only recent conservative leadership campaign in Canada to suffer from these kind of shenanigans; Kenney's leadership bid in Alberta featured all kinds of skullduggery and there was enough bad blood over Andrew Scheer's win for the federal party that it caused the loser(?) Maxime Bernier to start a schism. The new rules for the leadership race that strongly encourages trying to sign up as many new members as possible (legitimately or not) may be fostering all kinds of nefarious plots. In any case it makes for top-end political popcorn.",

He was \"getting Brexit done\" and successfully broke through the red wall of Labour voters in middle England. With the left sinking more and more in the morass of identity politics, the conservatives were well-positioned to win the working-class voters who were fed up with woke politicians playing to the prejudices of the urban professional-managerial class. In 2020 with the spread of BLM fads in the summer of race riots in America the conservative government had successfully posed as defenders of history and tradition against the ignorant rioters. Their performance on covid was also praised because Brexit enabled the government to avoid being yoked to the inefficient Brussels bureaucracy. Given the continuing culture wars, with their leftist opponents reliably picking the wrong side, it seemed that the conservatives were poised to just keep winning.\n\nYet today Johnson has resigned. This came after a bunch of his ministers quit the government in the last 48 hours. Boris was stampeded to the exit by his own party, shrugging  in his resignation speech that \"them's the breaks\". Notably for all the comparisons to Trump, this never happened to the latter for the GOP was much more house-trained under Trump than the Tories ever were under Johnson. This has already been described as a slow-moving coup perpetrated by the liberal media with their never-ending drip-drip of various \"scandals\" and \"-gates\" which panicked conservative MPs and whetted their appetites for back-stabbing once they smelled the blood in the water. Ultimately, Johnson has only himself to blame because losing control of your own party in a parliamentary system is fatal.",

    "body": "**Is This the End of Newsmax and OAN?**\n\nThis is coming a bit late, but over the past month or so, a court in Delaware has denied motions to dismiss in Dominion's lawsuits against Newsmax and Fox News. The court hasn't ruled on a similar suit against OAN yet but, given that it is, in my opinion, the strongest of the three, I'd be willing to bet that this one moves forward as well. Dominion is suing these media companies for defamation, claiming that statements concerning their Venezuelan ties, role in rigging the 2020 election, etc. have damaged their business to the tune of billions of dollars. \n\nThe reason I'm seriously wondering if these two networks are finished is because, with these rulings, Dominion has cleared the biggest hurdle of the lawsuit. When defamation involves public figures and matters of public interest (as this defamation undoubtedly does), plaintiffs must show that the defendant acted with \"actual malice\"; that is, they must prove that the defamatory statements were made either with the express knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. This is a tough standard to meet and is why celebrities haven't put supermarket tabloids out of business. Media companies in the United States are given pretty wide latitude to report on rumors, allegations, and other items where certainty isn't exactly bulletproof. But if they have actual knowledge that something is untrue, and publish it anyway, they can be held liable. \"Reckless disregard\" is much slipperier, but the general idea is that if you have piles of evidence that strongly suggest that something isn't true you can't just publish it without cautionary language indicating the uncertainty surrounding it. As a caution, I'm only explaining all this to provide context for how this case may play out. I'm not interested in debating whether it's fair that something some liberal network said should be considered defamatory, because first, these cases are very fact dependent and I don't know all the facts about hypothetical MSNBC cockups, and, second, it's irrelevant unless there's actually a lawsuit. \n\nAnyway, this standard is notoriously difficult to meet, mainly because most entities worth suing are sufficiently sophisticated to avoid making false statements of fact. It should also be noted that the decisions don't conclusively say that the networks acted with actual malice, simply that Dominion has alleged enough facts that a reasonable jury could conclude that they acted with actual malice. I'd also note that I left Fox out of the headline because the case against them appears to be significantly weaker than the cases against Newsmax and OAN, and in any event they are more likely to be able to pay a settlement or verdict. Having failed to get a motion to dismiss, the networks can assert a number of defenses:\n\n**Truth:** I doubt they'll actually assert this, as it would essentially involve proving that Dominion has ties to Hugo Chavez and created software designed to rig the election. If the networks had any evidence of this they wouldn't have held onto it to be used in a future lawsuit.\n\n**Statement of Opinion:** Opinions are protected under the First Amendment. However, merely couching a defamatory statement as an opinion isn't enough to overcome a defamation claim; the courts aren't going to make it so you can get away with anything as long as you preface it with \"I think.\" This is one defense the networks are likely to assert, but proving it is going to be difficult. Given the sheer amount of coverage OAN and Newsmax gave to the Dominion allegations (with OAN seemingly airing Mike Lindell documentaries as fast as he could produce them), claiming that they were merely expressing an opinion with no intention of presenting the reporting as factual is going to be a hard sell.\n\n**Privilege:** Occasionally, there are certain situations where one is privileged to make defamatory statements without consequence. These usually relate to official proceedings—court testimony, legislative sessions, etc. The one privilege that Newsmax, in particular, is claiming is a \"neutral reportage\" privilege that says in essence that when public figures make statements about matters of public concern, news organizations are privileged to report those allegations without fear of defamation. There are two obvious problems with this defense. The first is that it is derived from certain Circuit Court decisions that imply it's a First Amendment issue. This means that it's not a recognized common-law defense and isn't necessarily a protected constitutional right. So Newsmax is arguing that a state court should apply precedent from a Federal court that isn't even controlling over the entire Federal Court system; in effect, they want a Delaware court to give non-controlling law the force of a constitutional imperative, which isn't exactly firm footing. The second problem is that even if the court takes them up on their offer, it's highly unlikely that Newsmax meets the criteria required for protection. Without listing all the elements, it's clear that the privilege, to the extent that it exists, is intended to protect media agencies who neutrally and dispassionately report the contents of defamatory allegations without taking sides. Newsmax and OAN became All Fraud All the Time for months following the election, and repeatedly had guests like Sidney Powell repeating the allegations to sympathetic interviewers who offered little to no pushback, and in many cases parroted the allegations themselves. It's unlikely that any reasonable person could have watched either network's coverage of the election challenges for any period of time and come to the conclusion that they weren't putting forth any particular point of view. \n\n**Retraction:** If a defendant retracts the defamatory statements in a timely manner it will usually serve as an effective defense. This is a nonstarter her, however, since Dominion repeatedly asked the networks to issue retractions and not only did the networks refuse, but continued airing defamatory material in spite of these requests.\n\nGiven that the Actual Malice hurdle has been cleared and the available defenses aren't good, I'd say that the chances of a jury verdict are pretty high. The only real question is damages, but given that they're confident in asking for over a billion dollars, even a significant reduction would still be disastrous for Newsmax and OAN. These aren't large networks with a ton of cash lying around, and this probably wouldn't be their only debt. If a jury awards a tenth of what Dominion is asking they're probably looking at bankruptcy.\n\nThe most obvious counterargument to this is \"If the networks' cases are so bad, they'll just settle.\" The problem with this is that the networks couldn't offer any amount of money to make it worth it for Dominion to settle (the exception is Fox, but the case against Fox is much weaker and Fox has more money). Dominion isn't suing second-tier networks because it expects to get a lot of money. It's suing them to get vindication and rehabilitate their public image. The biggest issue for Dominion moving forward is that the taint of these allegations makes it difficult for them to get contracts. If a county is looking to replace its voting machines or renew an existing contract with Dominion, there is going to be a certain amount of public pressure to go with another vendor \"just to stay on the safe side\". I don't know the ins and outs of every state's bidding  procedures to know if a county can be forced into accepting a Dominion contract, but if there's any room for discretion a county may opt to ignore Dominion entirely just to avoid any possible controversy. The potential damages are unknowable, and Dominion is obviously erring on the high side, and Dominion knows that it can't possibly hope to recover for all the damage the allegations did. What they can hope for, however, is that a jury verdict stating not only are the allegations unproven or lacking in evidence (as some of the Powell lawsuit dismissals implied), but are demonstrably and indisputable false. False to the point that we're making those who repeated them publicly pay large sums of money. It's not perfect, but it's probably the best Dominion can hope for.",

They are, at worst, pretending they don’t know that what they are doing is wrong; or, what is almost as bad, they are utterly clueless: they are unable or unwilling to listen to women because their own sense of entitlement drowns out everything else.\n\nThe concept of \"entitlement\" is frequently used in feminist discourse to explain male sexual behavior, particularly in cases of rape and sexual assault.  I am skeptical of this concept and its explanatory power, and I'll attempt to outline why.\n\nMy own personal theory is that male sexual behavior, good and bad, is largely explained by the fact that men simply desire to engage in the sexual acts that they carry out, in the same way that the fact that people eat food is largely explained by the fact that people get hungry and food tastes good.  My intention in this post is not to defend the desire theory though - it's just to critique the entitlement theory.\n\nActually, I'm skeptical that the idea of \"acting out of a sense of entitlement\" is even coherent.  Entitlement seems to me, first and foremost, to be an objective relation that obtains between you and something else, not a psychological attitude that you take towards something else.  To be entitled to X is to be in a legal or social relation with X that grants you control over or access to X.  Your attitudes and motivations don't enter into the picture.  \n\nIndeed, when I try to imagine thought experiments where I or someone else is primarily motivated to act by a \"sense of entitlement\", I'm not sure if I can do it.  It always seems more appropriate to use other concepts to explain the motivations instead - raw desire, or protecting one's wounded pride, or maintaining the coherence of one's self-image, or any number of things.  But it's hard to think of a scenario where \"entitlement\" seems like an appropriate psychological concept to explain someone's motivations.  Ultimately, it seems that it's just a sneer-like word, too pre-loaded with moral judgment to be explanatorily useful.\n\nIt seems more plausible to defend the idea that someone could act out of a *mistaken belief* that they are entitled to something, rather than acting out of raw entitlement itself.  These sorts of scenarios are much easier to imagine.  But is this what men actually do?  I think not.  What man actually believes that he's entitled to sexual access to women in today's Western society?  I've seen no evidence that any sizable number of men actually believe this, but I've seen plenty of evidence to the contrary.\n\nConsider the discourse that circulates in \"manosphere\", \"The Red Pill\", and \"pick-up artist\" forums.  I don't know how you can walk away with any belief other than that these men are *acutely* aware that they are *not* entitled to sexual access to women in any way.  They become completely obsessed with the idea of self-improvement, because the only alternative in their view is dying bitter and alone.  Every day is a constant Darwinian struggle against other men for access to extremely scarce reproductive resources.  Even if they are able to secure a long-term relationship or even marriage with a woman, they are never allowed a moment's rest.  They constantly have to be on top of their game, always striving to assert dominance, otherwise their woman will leave them for Chad Thundercock at the drop of a hat.  How could anyone think that this paints a psychological portrait of an entitled individual?\n\nGiven the flaws with the entitlement theory, why are feminists so attracted to it?  I have two hypotheses:\n\nOne is a simple failure of imagination on the part of women.  In the female experience, there is no analogue of male sexual desire.  (Probably there are many feminists who reject the idea that men and women experience sexual desire differently at all).  Women have a hard time believing that men could really just want sex *that fucking much*, to the point that it drives men to do the sorts of insane and violent things that men are known for.\n\nThe second is that feminism demands a theory of male sexual desire that renders it socially mutable.  If men do what they do because of biological drives, then that means we just have to live with it, which is horrifying.  But if men do what they do because they've been instilled with a false sense of entitlement, then we can just educate them on the appropriate way to have relations with women and everything will be fine.  So the thinking goes.  I make no judgments here - I'm just outlining my thinking on why feminism is structurally predisposed to adopt certain theories over others.\n\nOf course, I don't think that male sexual behavior *entirely* reduces to basic biological desires.  Certainly sexual behavior can be rooted in other motives as well, like social validation.  But I'm skeptical that entitlement has a role to play in the overall picture.",

    "body": "There are many, many valid reasons to oppose the overturning of Roe. But I think it’s dangerous and inaccurate to frame this solely as women’s rights being taken away. That’s absolutely an element, but we need to be cognizant that we’re not just talking about a Pap smear here. Framing this as only being an issue of womens rights necessarily means that anyone who supported the ruling is literally just out there to rescind the rights of women. And that misses that, ultimately, abortion laws are about at what point a fetus becomes a life, and therefore at what point it becomes wrong. Most people agree that late term abortions are wrong, so I think most concede that to some extent. But those who supported this ruling did so because they think that a fetus is a human almost immediately. To me this really just illustrates the detrimental and all-consuming impact of identity politics, in which everything is viewed first and foremost with respect to one’s identity. There are important factors outside of that and that is not always the primary consideration. \n\nReally, though, what I want to drive home is that viewing this solely in terms of women’s rights guarantees that you miss the other sides POV and necessarily means they are just evil people. And failing to consider this ensures that this debate is never actually going to reflect the real issue here. People are just going to view it as good v evil. And I wanna be clear here and say that I am not defending those who supported the ruling.",

    "body": "####Illiteracy of Christianity\n\nApologies for the rambling tone.\n\nI recently started playing *Wasteland 3* and been having a lot of fun. Early on in the game, there is [a cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXeHwhLPKz8) of the Christian hymn [*Are You Washed in the Blood?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Washed_in_the_Blood) that plays as part of a dramatic setpiece battle. I found the cover really quite catchy, and went to listen to it outside the game and find the original hymn (I hadn't heard it before). Apparently I wasn't the only one who enjoyed the song and many other Wasteland 3 players did the same. However, I found their comments on the 'genuine' renditions by actual Christian artists to be very strange to me. They frequently describing the tone and lyrics (and the Youtube comments of Christians) on the song as 'creepy' or 'cultish'.\n\nIt's obvious why people find the Wasteland 3 version creepy. It's a pretty sinister sounding rendition and you hear it when you the player are fighting a post-apocalyptic inbred redneck cult family while destruction and blood surround you. The 'genuine' versions are more tricky. Clearly [many Christians listening to the hymn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJWgpljckbA) don't feel it's creepy, but fulfilling and positive.\n\nMaybe the non-Christians finding it creepy have a point. Lyrics like \"washed in the Blood of the Lamb\" and \"are your garments spotless\" do sound very strange or creepy devoid of any context. But these lyrics *aren't* devoid of context, it's clearly a Christian hymn. Rather, non-Christians (secularized Americans) don't *understand* the context. They don't know what the 'Blood' or 'Lamb' means or represents. They are illiterate of the language of Christianity. As a cultural/lapsed Catholic, I wouldn't consider myself *fluent* in 'Christian', but I'm certainly literate enough that I don't find the lyrics of the song creepy and can easily understand their meaning.\n\nIt's like hearing an idiom literally translated from another language. e.g. the Swedish idiom '*to shit in a blue cupboard*'. Removed from its linguistic and cultural home makes it sound like the Swedes are crazy. There was an image that reached the front page of reddit recently of [an ethnic group in Indonesia that exhumes their ancestors' bodies to dress them up and spend time with them](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/vqeptq/the_toraja_people_in_indonesia_periodically_dig/), something that would seem absolutely ghastly and creepy to many Westerners despite being a positive and joyous event for this ethnic group.\n\nThis is not really a brand new thought for me, but rather this was just a crystalizing event. I recall a [public lecture from Camile Paglia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvmTHQviAHM) where she describes teaching a class 15 years ago on the art of song lyrics where she was playing the hymn 'Go Down Moses'. After a lack of engagement from the students, she came to the shocking revelation that virtually none of the students knew who Moses was. Seemingly the only engagement contemporary secular America has with Christian themes is negative, cynical and superficial portrayals in media. Typically some evil redneck evangelical doomsday cult that serves as than antagonist who is more that happy to use Christian symbols in their evil plans. Obviously *Wasteland 3*, but media like *Farcry 5* or the Netflix movie *The Devil All The Time* and many others. Sure, Americans might know some superficial details, like Christmas being the celebration of Jesus' birth, but they have no real understanding of Christianity.\n\nThe reason I think this is important for the US (and its cultural sphere) is it renders secular Americans unable to communicate, understand and ultimately find common ground with American Christians, who still make up a sizable portion of the US population. I don't believe this was the case in the past (though I have no strong evidence), where secular individuals or even atheists understood Christianity in the broad sense, being an important part of American life. It also breeds hostility, as there is a tendency to view people one cannot understand with suspicion (exacerbated with the negative portrayals of Christianity in media). I also suspect this illiteracy is largely unidirectional too, as most Christians are exposed to the glut of secular/liberal media that exists.\n\nEdit: Just to add an addendum, I do wonder what the consequences of this are. A lack of understanding of the cultural history of the West, a lack of understanding of the most influential moral system in the word, is this a void that secular religions are rushing to fill? Is America truly culturally secular now?",

Left gained most among high education, high income votes, but only reached parity there. So left support is now concentrated among high education low income voters.\n\nI've skimmed the paper, and it does not appear to raise any discussion of Peter Turchin's [elite overproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_overproduction), but I feel like that is the natural direction to take the research.  Here is a bit from the conclusion:\n\n&gt; The emerging party positioning in the policy space has led to a deteriorating partisan representation for high-education/high-income and--especially--low-education/low-income citizens. While liberal parties in some countries adopted right-libertarian positions that are attractive to high-education/high-income voters, the main party on the right typically drifted toward authoritarian positions. Low-education/low-income voters fared worse: in no country [of the 21 studied] do viable left-authoritarian parties exist. Without obvious political homes, therefore, the low-education/low-income and high-education/high-income groups have become cross-pressured voter groups--up for grabs--between the left and right fields of parties.\n\nOf course, many people live in countries ruled by left-authoritarian parties; most of those people are Chinese.  I doubt many will be surprised to hear that wealthy democracy is incompatible with redistributionist authoritarianism; to me it sounds like a clear contradiction in terms.  But the specific data on how \"polarity reversal\" happens *given* cross-pressured voter groups seems interesting.",

(see below under the left)\n* The bible doesn't ban abortion and nor should your religion dictate what others do.\n* The idea that a clump of cells is a person is ridiculous. \n* In Ohio, right wing policymaking just denied an abortion to a raped ten year old. \n* Preaching adoption and then not adopting any kids smacks of hypocrisy. \n\nThe left: \n\n* The people on the right believe that abortion **kills a baby**. The folks on the left don't agree with that, but insist on ignoring this motivation. I cannot tell you how disingenuous this is. \"Your motivation isn't what you say it is, but instead is whatever I get to define it as\". It is nothing more than the other side of the coin to \"the left is out to kill babies\". Taking the worst argument of the right and inverting it is unforgiveable. \n* Your body autonomy arguments are all incoherent. Each and every one of them is perfectly cogent so long as you assume the fetus inside you isn't a person. The right has already assumed the fetus is a person so the argument is a non-starter. To the right, it's like saying, \"If I was at the edge of the cliff and someone was hanging onto my arm so as not to fall into a chasm and die, it's TOTALLY not murder for me to shake them off my arm. Because it's **my** arm and they're not allowed to use it!\" It's an echo chamber argument that has zero chance of convincing the opposition. \n* Instead of spending the age of social media trying to win over hearts and minds, you have taken every opportunity to silence yourself to the people who need your voices the most. How many times have we seen \"If you agree with \\[insert right wing policy\\] then unfriend/unfollow/etc. me!\" You should have been working to reach people this whole time, but you didn't.",

Australia’s Indigenous population went up steeply to 813,000 people (3.2 per cent of the population).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This increase of 25 per cent compared to 2016 data is huge.

    "body": "I was at the doctor's office the other day, and I saw a curious poster on the wall. I can't remember the organization that sponsored the poster, and unfortunately I can't find it online, but I remember the concept it promoted: it was about **moral injury**, which is an idea I'd never heard of before. I looked it up, and apparently [the core concept](https://moralinjuryproject.syr.edu/about-moral-injury/) is about war:\n\n&gt; Within the context of military service, particularly regarding the experience of war, \"moral injury\" refers to the lasting emotional, psychological, social, behavioral, and spiritual impacts of actions that violate a service member’s core moral values and behavioral expectations of self or others.\n\nIn other words, it's the deep spiritual and psychological damage that happens when soldiers are ordered to do things that conflict with their personal moral codes: killing people, taking actions that lead to civilian casualties, having to abandon friends on the battlefield to accomplish the mission. Serious, earth-shattering things like that. Some of the deepest horrors of war.\n\nBut the poster I saw wasn't about the experiences of veterans or the terror of the battlefield. It was about \"a nurse who feels ashamed of having a medical condition because she's a nurse.\"\n\nTo me, this feels like a substantial deviation from the original definition of \"moral injury.\" An \"injury to pride,\" maybe. Or perhaps it's best described as a psychological struggle with unnecessary shame. I'm not saying that a medical professional being ashamed of having a medical condition is a good thing, that there shouldn't be therapies and programs that help people overcome this unnecessary shame and stigma, or that having posters in doctor's offices promoting awareness of this problem is a bad idea.\n\nAll I'm saying is, maybe it's not such a good idea to use the same term to describe this phenomenon that we use to describe soldiers facing the terrible moral horrors of warfare.\n\nI know the medical field is hard. Sometimes earth-shatteringly hard. I know it can sometimes feel like a war-zone, a constant fight against death and injury that can never be won, a perpetual Afghanistan withdrawal. I also know it can be especially hard on nurses, who do so much to keep our hospitals and clinics going and are often under-appreciated (is that too much of a cliché?). I know that the job's so hard that we have a [major nurse shortage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493175/) in part due to high rates of burnout. And I know medical professionals often have to deal with belligerent patients, and sometimes they have to take actions -- like restraining or sedating a delirious patient, or holding someone against their will for a psychological evaluation -- that would be unacceptable in normal life.\n\nBut it just feels wrong to me, equating the experiences of people in a profession whose cardinal rule is \"first do no harm,\" with a profession whose cardinal rule, as set out in international law, is [\"well you can harm *some* people\"](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/06/28/621112394/the-rules-of-war-are-being-broken-what-exactly-are-they). Especially when what's being compared isn't the experience of violating one's moral code and finding one's ethical conception of the self and maybe even the world being shattered, but the personal shame of a nurse who feels like having a serious illness is unfitting for her. (I use a female pronoun not to claim that all nurses are women, although the [vast majority in the United States](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hr/gender-ratio-of-nurses-across-50-states.html) are, but because the original poster I saw depicted a woman as the nurse in question.)\n\nThis feels part and parcel of a social tendency that concerns me: the \"social traumatization\" of society, where more and more life experiences are described in terms of trauma and in increasingly intense ways.\n\nMedical professionals experiencing shame because of a personal diagnosis is a problem, and it's a problem I hope they're able to receive help for, so they can move on with their lives and receive proper treatment for the physical ailment. But although it's a problem, it's not an \"I had to kill a man to survive in the trenches, it was either him or me\"-level problem.\n\nRemoving the terminological distinctions between these things, I believe, eliminates essential social and psychological information that helps people contextualize their negative experiences and find peace in overcoming them.\n\nautomod_multipart_lockme",
