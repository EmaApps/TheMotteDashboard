It isn't intended as a 'containment thread' and any content which could go here could instead be posted in its own thread. You could post:\n\n- Requests for advice and / or encouragement. On basically any topic and for any scale of problem.\n\n- Updates to let us know how you are doing. This provides valuable feedback on past advice / encouragement and will hopefully make people feel a little more motivated to follow through. If you want to be reminded to post your update, see the post titled 'update reminders', below.\n\n- Advice. This can be in response to a request for advice or just something that you think could be generally useful for many people here.\n\n- Encouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people (if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it).",
